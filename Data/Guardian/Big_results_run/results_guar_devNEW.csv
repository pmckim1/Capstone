2021-03-03T11:05:17Z,global-development,Global development,TikTok urged to take action over Myanmar death threat videos,"TikTok has been urged to take action over a flood of videos shared in Myanmar that feature men in military uniform threatening to kill anti-coup protesters, at times while brandishing weapons. Myanmar’s police and army have been widely condemned for using lethal force against peaceful protesters who have held mass rallies over recent weeks calling for the return of democracy. At least 33 people were killed on Wednesday when police fired with live ammunition in multiple towns and cities, according to reports by Associated Press, the worst day of violence since the coup on 1 February.
While officers have repeatedly used force to try to crush protests, men dressed in army and police uniform are using TikTok to threaten the public, despite the Chinese-owned social media app’s guidelines forbidding incitement of violence. In one video, a man in a face mask and full military fatigues calls supporters of the ousted democratic leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, the “motherfucking reds”, referring to the colour of her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), and warns: “Don’t touch General Min Aung Hlaing ... It will cost you your life. Hear? You will die.” The video was posted on 13 February and has been viewed more than 180,000 times. It remained online as of Wednesday morning. Other videos are more explicit. The user Yekoko119 threatened on 27 February to shoot and throw grenades at NLD supporters, whom he described as “motherfuckers” who “gather in groups to bark” and “can all die”. Htaike Htaike Aung, the executive director at Myanmar ICT for Development Organization, a Yangon-based digital rights group, said she had seen more than 800 pro-military videos over recent weeks that featured a song threatening protesters. The song adapts the words of a popular protest chant – “the military tactics given by Aung San are not to be used to kill the people” – altering the lyrics to state that the military can shoot people. Gen Aung San, the father of Aung San Suu Kyi, founded the military and helped win the country its independence.
The song, which was available in the TikTok sound library, has since been removed, and the associated videos have also disappeared, though it is not clear whether or not it was taken down by app’s moderation team. “This particular soundtrack is just the tip of the iceberg,” added Htaike Htaike Aung. One video seen by the Guardian, posted by a user with the account name Ye Ye, features a man dressed in fatigues and holding a gun, with another soldier in the background. “It’s not a game where you can get healed after being shot. This is a polite warning to the protesters. Be careful, whatever you do,” he tells viewers. The video, posted on 21 February, has so far received 37,200 views. In another clip, since deleted, the user ronaloo3 says soldiers will “chase the dogs” at 8pm, referring to the time pro-democracy supporters bang their pots and pans in protest against the coup. Loading his automatic weapon, he adds: “Don’t like it?” Many of the soldiers use the hashtags #lilhuddy and #addisonre, the names of the American TikTok celebrities Chase Hudson and Addison Rae, in an attempt to attract more views. It is not clear if soldiers have been ordered to post such videos. The Chinese-owned TikTok, which has 800 million users worldwide, has become increasingly popular in Myanmar over the past year, especially among young people. Wai Wai Nu, the founder of the Women’s Peace Network, said the app was giving a free pass to the military. “Our question now is are we going to let this social media company [allow] the military and criminals to be able to manipulate agendas and organise activities to threaten public safety and security?” Htaike Htaike Aung said TikTok must improve the process of reporting content that violated its guidelines and set up a dedicated Myanmar team. She also recommended further steps be taken to prevent the platform from being misused, such as employing third-party factcheckers. In a statement, TikTok said it was committed to promoting “a safe and welcoming app environment for our community.”. “We have clear community guidelines that state we do not allow content that incites violence or misinformation that causes harm to individuals, our community, or the larger public. TikTok will continue to follow these principles globally, including around issues like election results. “As it relates to Myanmar, we have been and continue to promptly remove all content that incites violence or spreads misinformation, and are aggressively monitoring to remove any such content that violates our guidelines,” the company said. Facebook, which has long been criticised for failing to stop hate speech and disinformation from being spread on its platform in Myanmar, recently banned official military accounts. The junta had blocked the social network in the aftermath of the coup as it sought to prevent people from organising protests, but many got around the restrictions by downloading VPNs and the army had continued to use the site to share its announcements. Since the coup, the military has clamped down on independent media and ratcheted up its propaganda efforts. State news barely acknowledges the protests that are gripping the country, only doing so to wrongfully accuse protesters of violence or threaten action against people who are participating in a national strike. Journalists have been assaulted and detained by the authorities. On Wednesday it was announced that six media workers had been charged for covering the coup, under a law against “causing fear, spreading false news or agitating directly or indirectly a government employee”. The group includes journalists for Associated Press, Myanmar Now, Myanmar Photo Agency, 7Day News, Zee Kwet online news and a freelancer. They could face up to three years in jail."
2021-03-03T07:00:10Z,global-development,Global development,"Civilian deaths in conflict plummeted during pandemic, report finds","The number of civilian casualties in conflicts around the world plummeted during the Covid-19 pandemic, a new report shows. Last year, an average of 10 civilians a day were reported killed by explosive weapons, compared with 18 in 2019, according to analysis by Action on Armed Violence (AOAV), a London-based charity. In all, 8,165 people were reported killed by explosive weapons – artillery shells, rockets, mortar bombs and aerial bombing – across 48 countries and territories last year, of whom 3,668 were civilians, it said. More than 10,500 people were reported injured.
The fall of 43% represents the largest percentage drop in civilian casualties in conflict reported over the past 10 years. In March last year, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for a global ceasefire to allow the respite needed to manage the coronavirus pandemic. Iain Overton, the director of AOAV, said: “Our data seems to support there being a general decline in deaths and injuries as a consequence of the pandemic. It could be due to less reporting of violence, or it could be due to restrictions due to the pandemic and ceasefires. “If the pandemic can stop people blowing people up then why can’t states?” he added. “This is proof that man-made violence can be prevented.” The data was published as nations gather online this week to resume negotiations on a political declaration to strengthen the protection of civilians in urban warfare. About 70 states are expected to take part in the consultations, which begin on 3 March. Laura Boillot, coordinator of the International Network on Explosive Weapons, an international network of NGOs, said: “What Covid has shown is that when humanity is focused on more pressing issues, it can reduce violence. Why does it have to take a pandemic to stop bombing civilians?” Last year was the fourth consecutive year that reports of civilian deaths from explosives have declined, largely due to the short-term defeats of Islamist groups such as Isis in Iraq and Syria, and Boko Haram in Nigeria. Afghanistan was the deadliest conflict for civilians last year, with 3,490 reported deaths and injuries of civilians from explosives, according to the data. The country overtook Syria, which recorded 3,013 deaths and injuries, for the first time since 2011, when AOAV began gathering data. Pakistan, Yemen and Libya followed with 684, 683 and 671 civilian casualties reported respectively. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama) has reported a “disturbing” rise in the number of civilians killed and injured since the start of peace negotiations in September. About 43% of recorded civilians killed in 2020 were women and children. More women died in the conflict in 2020 than in any year since Unama began systematic documentation in 2009. In a report last month, Unama expressed “grave concern” over the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, especially the use of indirect fire, such as artillery shells, mortars and rockets during ground engagements, but also the use of airstrikes and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). AOAV’s explosive violence monitoring project records casualties using data from the Londo-based non-profit monitoring agency Airwars, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and reliable English-language media sources."
2021-03-03T06:00:10Z,global-development,Global development,Smile for the camera: dark side of China's emotion-recognition tech ,"“Ordinary people here in China aren’t happy about this technology but they have no choice. If the police say there have to be cameras in a community, people will just have to live with it. There’s always that demand and we’re here to fulfil it.” So says Chen Wei at Taigusys, a company specialising in emotion recognition technology, the latest evolution in the broader world of surveillance systems that play a part in nearly every aspect of Chinese society. Emotion-recognition technologies – in which facial expressions of anger, sadness, happiness and boredom, as well as other biometric data are tracked – are supposedly able to infer a person’s feelings based on traits such as facial muscle movements, vocal tone, body movements and other biometric signals. It goes beyond facial-recognition technologies, which simply compare faces to determine a match.
But similar to facial recognition, it involves the mass collection of sensitive personal data to track, monitor and profile people and uses machine learning to analyse expressions and other clues. The industry is booming in China, where since at least 2012, figures including President Xi Jinping have emphasised the creation of “positive energy” as part of an ideological campaign to encourage certain kinds of expression and limit others. Critics say the technology is based on a pseudo-science of stereotypes, and an increasing number of researchers, lawyers and rights activists believe it has serious implications for human rights, privacy and freedom of expression. With the global industry forecast to be worth nearly $36bn by 2023, growing at nearly 30% a year, rights groups say action needs to be taken now. ‘Intimidation and censorship’ The main office of Taigusys is tucked behind a few low-rise office buildings in Shenzhen. Visitors are greeted at the doorway by a series of cameras capturing their images on a big screen that displays body temperature, along with age estimates, and other statistics. Chen, a general manager at the company, says the system in the doorway is the company’s bestseller at the moment because of high demand during the coronavirus pandemic. Chen hails emotion recognition as a way to predict dangerous behaviour by prisoners, detect potential criminals at police checkpoints, problem pupils in schools and elderly people experiencing dementia in care homes.
Taigusys systems are installed in about 300 prisons, detention centres and remand facilities around China, connecting 60,000 cameras. “Violence and suicide are very common in detention centres,” says Chen. “Even if police nowadays don’t beat prisoners, they often try to wear them down by not allowing them to fall asleep. As a result, some prisoners will have a mental breakdown and seek to kill themselves. And our system will help prevent that from happening.” Chen says that since prisoners know they are monitored by this system – 24 hours a day, in real time – they are made more docile, which for authorities is a positive on many fronts. “Because they know what the system does, they won’t consciously try to violate certain rules,” he says.
Besides prisons and police checkpoints, Taigusys has deployed its systems in schools to monitor teachers, pupils and staff, in care homes for older people to detect falls and changes in the emotional state of residents, and in shopping centres and car parks. While the use of emotion-recognition technology in schools in China has sparked some criticism, there has been very little discussion of its use by authorities on citizens. Chen, while aware of the concerns, played up the system’s potential to stop violent incidents. He cites an incident where a security guard stabbed about 41 people in the province of Guangxi in southern China last June, claiming it was technologically preventable. Vidushi Marda is a digital program manager at the British human rights organisation Article 19 and a lawyer focused on the socio-legal implications of emerging technologies. She disputes Chen’s view on the Guangxi stabbing.
“This is a familiar and slightly frustrating narrative that we see used frequently when newer, ‘shiny’ technologies are introduced under the umbrella of safety or security, but in reality video surveillance has little nexus to safety, and I’m not sure how they thought that feedback in real time would fix violence,” Marda told the Guardian. “A lot of biometric surveillance, I think, is closely tied to intimidation and censorship, and I suppose [emotion recognition] is one example of just that.” Biometrics 3.0 A recent report by Article 19 on the development of these surveillance technologies – which one Chinese firm describes as “biometrics 3.0” – by 27 companies in China found its growth without safeguards and public deliberation, was especially problematic, particularly in the public security and education sectors. Ultimately, groups such as Article 19 say that the technology should be banned before widespread adoption globally makes the ramifications too difficult to contain. The Guardian contacted a range of companies covered in the report. Only Taigusys responded to an interview request. Another problem is that recognition systems are usually based on actors posing in what they think are happy, sad, angry and other emotional states and not on real expressions of those emotions. Facial expressions can also vary widely across cultures, leading to further inaccuracies and ethnic bias. One Taigusys system that is used by police in China, as well as security services in Thailand and some African countries, includes identifiers such as “yellow, white, black”, and even “Uighur”.
“The populations in these countries are more racially diverse than in China, and in China, it’s also used to tell Uighurs from Han Chinese,” Chen says, referring to the country’s dominant ethnicity. “If an Uighur appears, they will be tagged, but it won’t tag Han Chinese.” Potential for misuse Asked if he was concerned about these features being misused by authorities, Chen says that he is not worried because the software is being used by police, implying that such institutions should be automatically trusted. “I’m not concerned because it’s not our technology that’s the problem,” Chen says. “There are demands for this technology in certain scenarios and places, and we will try our best to meet those demands.” For Shazeda Ahmed, a visiting researcher at New York University’s AI Now Institute who contributed to the Article 19 report, these are all “terrible reasons”. “That Chinese conceptions of race are going to be built into technology and exported to other parts of the world is really troubling, particularly since there isn’t the kind of critical discourse [about racism and ethnicity in China] that we’re having in the United States,” she tells the Guardian. “If anything, research and investigative reporting over the last few years have shown that sensitive personal information is particularly dangerous when in the hands of state entities, especially given the wide ambit of their possible use by state actors.” One driver of the emotion-recognition technology sector in China is the country’s lack of strict privacy laws. There are essentially no laws restricting the authorities’ access to biometric data on grounds of national security or public safety, which gives companies such as Taigusys complete freedom to develop and roll out these products when similar businesses in the US, Japan or Europe cannot, says Chen. “So we have the chance to gather as much information as possible and find the best scenarios to make use of that data,” he says."
2021-03-02T16:53:38Z,global-development,Global development,Anti-coup protesters in Myanmar critically injured by live rounds,"Three people have been critically injured after security forces fired live rounds at anti-coup protesters in north-western Myanmar, medics said, as a regional meeting of south-east Asian countries failed to find a breakthrough to the political crisis. Police also fired stun grenades and rubber bullets on Tuesday to disperse protesters in the city of Yangon, according to witnesses, as demonstrations continued over the military’s removal of Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government a month ago. In the north-western town of Kale, a rally turned violent when security forces opened fire on protesters, according to medics who treated those wounded. “About 20 people were injured in a morning crackdown by police and soldiers in Kale,” said a rescue worker, on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions. “Three … were hit by live rounds and are in critical condition,” he said, adding that police had initially deployed teargas and rubber bullets, before doubling back with live rounds. A doctor who treated the patients in a local hospital confirmed the number of people in critical condition. “One was hit in his thigh and he’s now undergoing an operation. Another one got hit in the abdomen and he requires blood transfusions … Another one got hit in the chest,” he told Agence France-Presse. “His condition is a concern – we do not like it.” Sunday was the bloodiest day since the 1 February coup, with the UN saying that at least 18 protesters across the country were killed. Foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) discussed the coup and subsequent violence at a virtual meeting on Tuesday that failed to produce a common position during the meeting, two Asean diplomatic sources told Reuters.
A statement from the meeting’s chair, Brunei, on the outcome of the meeting, said Asean expressed concern about the situation in Myanmar and called on “all parties to refrain from instigating further violence”. “We expressed Asean’s readiness to assist Myanmar in a positive, peaceful and constructive manner,” it said. In a statement of remarks made during the summit, Singapore’s foreign minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, warned an inability to find a common Asean position “would starkly underscore our lack of unity, and undermine our credibility and relevance as an organisation”. The use of lethal force against unarmed civilians was “inexcusable”, he said. Balakrishnan and the foreign ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines called for the release of political detainees including the civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a position that was not endorsed by all at the summit. The “informal” meeting was the first involving the 10-nation group since the coup and included Myanmar’s military appointed foreign minister, Wunna Maung Lwin. Protesters – many wearing hard hats, thick gloves and goggles and holding makeshift shields – gathered on Tuesday behind barricades in different parts of Yangon, Myanmar’s commercial capital, to chant slogans against military rule. “If we’re oppressed, there will be explosion. If we’re hit, we’ll hit back,” the crowd chanted at one Yangon protest before police moved in to break it up with stun grenades, witnesses said. There were no reports of any injuries. “There is an anxious feeling,” said a 24-year-old demonstrator in a hard hat at Myaynigone Intersection. “No one knows what’s going to happen.” Moments later, police began firing stun grenades at the crowd she was in. In between the shots, she said: “They are trying to scare us to get us to disperse.” Crowds also gathered in other parts of the country, media reported. Sanchaung Street, a popular stretch about 20 minutes from downtown Yangon, was barricaded with sandbags by residents. A 25-year-old demonstrator said he expected the security forces to raid the area by the end of the day. “They come here shooting and steal anything valuable that they see,” he said outside his local teashop, which he said police had looted. “They are robbers. Now we are protecting our neighbourhood. They shot in this area this morning. It seems like they are taking a lunch break now, like they did yesterday. We are waiting for the second strike.”
Hundreds of people have been arrested since the coup, according to activists. Among them is a journalist for the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), who livestreamed the arrival of security forces outside his apartment on Monday in the coastal town of Myeik, where he had been filming protests. Loud bangs could be heard during Kaung Myat Hlaing’s live stream, which was hosted on DVB’s official Facebook page. “If you are shooting like this, how will I come down?” he shouted at the security forces outside. DVB said it had “no knowledge of where he was taken away, and which military authority took him”, adding that Kaung Myat Hlaing’s latest reports were on a weekend military crackdown in Myeik, as well as on Monday’s demonstrations.
The military justified the coup saying its complaints of fraud in a November election won by Aung San Suu Kyi’s party were ignored. The election commission said the vote was fair. Asean’s efforts to engage with Myanmar’s military have been criticised by some. A committee of ousted Myanmar lawmakers has declared the junta a “terrorist” group and said Asean’s engagement would give it legitimacy. Sa Sa, the committee’s anointed envoy to the United Nations, said Asean should have no dealings with “this illegitimate military-led regime”. With Reuters and Agence France-Presse"
2021-03-02T13:03:17Z,global-development,Global development,We’ve cut aid to Yemen and children will starve – is this what global Britain means?,"Three weeks ago, foreign office minister James Cleverly told me that in the face of drastic cuts to the UK’s aid budget, Yemen would remain a UK priority country and the government would use the full force of its diplomatic efforts to bring about peace. On Monday, those words rang hollow when he announced the UK was slashing humanitarian aid to Yemen by more than 50% compared with last year. As a consequence, an already devastated country now faces the worst famine in decades and the prospect of lasting peace seems further away than ever. Yemen is in the grip of a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. Since 2015, the country has been engulfed in a devastating civil war that has left hundreds of thousands dead, including tens of thousands of civilians. Many millions more are dealing with the destruction of critical infrastructure including hospitals and homes, internal displacement and a deepening economic crisis. This protracted and complex situation is only getting worse, with 80% of the population, including 12.4 million children, now in need of humanitarian assistance. Despite this clear need, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) suggests 3 million fewer Yemenis were receiving aid each month by late 2020 compared with the beginning of the year. Abeer Fowzi, of IRC Yemen, said “never before have Yemenis faced so little support from the international community – or so many simultaneous challenges”. Today, the greatest threat Yemenis face is that of severe hunger. Mark Lowcock, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, has warned that 50,000 Yemenis are already living in famine-like conditions and 400,000 under-fives are at risk of dying from hunger in the coming weeks. The UN was seeking nearly $4bn (£2.9bn) of humanitarian funding to stave off immediate disaster and help 16 million people across Yemen survive. It was hoped the UK would maintain previous levels of aid at about £200m last year. Lowcock has said anything less would be catastrophic for prospects for peace in the country, making the UK commitment of £87m all the more tragic. I was warned in January that British ambassadors in developing countries were being asked to cut their aid budgets by 50 to 70%. When I raised this with the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, he said he did not recognise the figure. Monday’s cut to aid for Yemen confirms my worst fears – that these figures are true and not even those in the most desperate humanitarian crises are safe.
There remains a shocking lack of transparency from government about where wider aid cuts will fall and I am not aware of any consultation with NGOs or partners in the global south to minimise their impact. I have heard about forthcoming cuts to projects seeking to empower girls to know their rights and report cases of violence, while warnings have also been sounded about programmes dealing with nutrition, water sanitation and hygiene and sexual and reproductive health. Analysis suggests that because of government cuts 5.3 million fewer children a year will be immunised and 4.5 million fewer will gain a decent education. As other G7 countries step up their aid commitments, the UK, despite hosting the G7 summit later this year, isn’t doing the same. In Yemen, the UK could have chosen to help avert catastrophic famine and build foundations for peace, but has instead decided to turn the other way. The words often repeated are that Yemenis aren’t starving, they are in fact being starved. It is even more perverse that the government made this decision while maintaining arms exports to countries connected to the civil war. On this, they’ve ignored calls from Labour, their own backbenches and President Joe Biden who, in his first foreign policy address, announced an end to all relevant arms sales to the war in Yemen. There is a wider concern, however: these decisions are establishing a worrying precedent for what “global Britain” – still largely undefined – really means. Slashing support for Yemen not only puts us dangerously out of step with our allies, but we are consciously abandoning millions on the brink of starvation. Is this really what global Britain should be? • Sarah Champion is the Labour MP for Rotherham and chair of the international development committee"
2021-03-02T11:00:46Z,global-development,Global development,'It’s an arms race’: the tech teams trying to outpace paedophiles online,"“Predators are often early adopters of technology,” says Sarah Smith, chief technology officer at the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a UK child abuse hotline. “It’s an arms race, we have to be constantly horizon-scanning.” Smith and her team, based in an unassuming office in Cambridge, are a key link in a chain of experts around the world developing and finessing technology that tracks down paedophiles and removes child abuse images found online. IWF analysts sit in front of screens for long hours each day, trawling through material flagged to their hotline by the public and police as potentially containing child abuse. The volume of images reported to them is increasing all the time, driven partly by the trend for predators to befriend children online and coerce them into sharing sexual images from their own bedrooms. “We only have 13 analysts and the internet is a huge place,” Smith says, “so we need to triage results for them to take action on. We have a ‘crawler’ that moves around the web trying to find child abuse material.” The vast majority of what they find, both through reports to their hotline and their own investigations, is on the open internet, rather than the dark web. Images are analysed and categorised according to severity of abuse or the age of the children involved. Then the experts turn them into “hashes”, which Smith describes as “a unique digital fingerprint”.
“Each image becomes a string of letters and numbers unique to that image – but from that string of information you can’t reverse-engineer the original image,” she says. This means the image can’t be recreated using the data attached to it. After the IWF analysts view the image and create a “hash”, nobody else in the chain tracking and monitoring the images has to view them again. The ever-growing hash list is given to internet operators, from Facebook to Yahoo, so they can scan messaging services to look for it. Such “photo DNA” is becoming increasingly sophisticated and can identify known images even when they have been altered. “This works where predators may change one pixel to avoid detection, or with one image from a series – we can find all of them from the one image that we have,” Smith says. IWF also shares a constantly updated list of keywords employed by paedophiles. This can be used to filter results in search engines, analyse conversations in messaging services or moderate chat as people play games. “Keywords can also identify sites where paedophiles are sharing newly created images because they will be having conversations using these words,” Smith says. “If we can identify those words and then find these sites, that is a high-priority target. Unlike with historic images, here children may still be at risk and there are safeguarding opportunities.” Once a child is safeguarded by police and social services, efforts go into finding any images of them that are circulating online.
“I’ve been doing this job for 11 years,” Smith says, “and I still see material I was seeing when I started. We know how traumatic this is for victims. We have spoken to children who say that if they are in a shop and they think they are being recognised, they wonder – has that person seen an image of me online?” The IWF’s next project aims to reach men before they go down the path of offending, as the number of men looking at images of children being abused continues to grow. Last year between April and September UK police arrested 4,700 people, almost all men, in connection with online child sexual abuse, more than 300 of whom were in the most serious category of offender, actively grooming more than one child.
The latest tool is a chatbot, designed in partnership with the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, a charity dedicated to preventing child sexual abuse that works directly with paedophiles in the UK. “We will use data to identify an internet user who is potentially at risk of either starting to seek or encountering this type of content, and a chatbot will target them and will tell them this is risky behaviour,” says Smith. “They can be offered links to follow and resources to prevent them going any further.”
Yet even as experts look at improving their technology, the tools they are using to fight online child abuse are at risk from demands for increased privacy online. Monitoring technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) systems operate beneath the surface of most major internet sites, constantly scanning for signs of child exploitation, from images of children being abused to the codewords used by paedophiles as they share images. When suspicious material is detected, an electronic tipoff is sent to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the US, which analyses it and passes it on to national child protection teams around the world. In 2019, internet service providers sent 17 million tipoffs to NCMEC. Last month the British paedophile David Wilson was jailed. He used Facebook to target and abuse children and the site’s tracking systems picked up his activities.
Facebook is preparing to fully encrypt its Messenger service, bringing it in line with WhatsApp and Instagram. Child protection experts fear the loss of millions of electronic tipoffs. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has called encryption a “pivot to privacy”, stating that protection of privacy online is what internet users are most concerned about. But child protection experts are worried about the impact it will have on their efforts. Smith says: “It will be like turning the lights out, the potential implications aren’t being considered.” Facebook has responded robustly to criticism from senior police officers and experts over encryption, saying “[We have] led the industry in developing new ways to prevent, detect, and respond to abuse. End-to-end encryption is … used by many services to keep people safe online and, when we roll it out on our other messaging services, we will build on our strong anti-abuse capabilities at WhatsApp. For example, WhatsApp bans around 250,000 accounts each month suspected of sharing child exploitative imagery.” But child protection experts say that what is needed is greater use of technology to track offenders and child abuse material.
In 2019, federal police in Australia got a tipoff from the NCMEC that a man in New South Wales was posting child abuse images online. Police in Australia tracked the images to Richard Aldinger, a 63-year-old father-of-two, and arrested him at his house in Sydney. Trawling through his devices they found that as well as sharing images of children being abused online, he had been directing the rape and abuse of a 12-year-old girl in the Philippines for two years through a livestreaming service. The girl was rescued and Aldinger is now in jail. But it was only through the images he shared with others that he was caught by scanning programmes, a common “slip” by predators that can lead to their downfall. John Tanagho is director of the International Justice Mission (IJM), based in Manila. The IJM was involved in the case of Richard Aldinger and works closely with police in the Philippines to protect children from live-streamed abuse. “We know technology is making it easier for people to abuse children,” he says. “We need to improve safety technology, and it’s urgent. We seeing very young children, of five or six, abused through livestreaming.”
Aldinger paid just AU$1,075 (£600) in total to the girl’s mother to facilitate her rape and abuse – about AU$80 (£45) each time. Such small sums might not usually trigger investigation by a money transfer service, but Tanagho thinks more could be done in this area. “These are payments from a 63-year-old in Australia to the Philippines where he has no family,” he says. “We know the Philippines is a hotspot for child exploitation. We could do what we call a ‘cross-sector’ match on a user with this profile who is transferring money, looking at whether he was also engaging in video calls an hour before or after. This happens already with terrorism financing.” Tanagho wants internet users to understand that protecting children doesn’t mean companies intruding on individual privacy. “The tools that are being used to detect child sexual abuse, they are really targeted artificial intelligence tools, built up through training them on actual child abuse material. It’s not like these scanning programmes are looking through people’s general videos.” He believes that despite the rise of online child abuse, there is reason to be optimistic. “I don’t think the picture is bleak,” he says, citing the online harms bill in the UK that will put responsibility on social media giants to protect children. “We could within three years have a safer internet. It will take global resolve, but it is doable.” When it comes down to it, he says, whose privacy matters most – that of the child, or that of the abuser? “The privacy of children who are sexually abused, their right for those images to be removed from the internet, what could be more important than that?”"
2021-03-02T07:00:41Z,global-development,Global development,Child abuse hotline reports rise in calls from men viewing illegal content,"Child abuse experts have reported a rise in the number of men contacting a specialist helpline for people who are watching or considering watching online child sexual abuse material. The Stop It Now! helpline had its busiest year in 2020, handling more than 12,500 calls, emails and live chats – up from 10,700 in 2019. More than 3,500 individuals asked for help because they were worried about their own or someone else’s online sexual behaviour towards children. Donald Findlater, director of the helpline, is concerned that a reported increase in the use of pornography during lockdown could have led some people to watch illegal material. He said: “Tens of thousands of people in the UK are viewing sexual images and videos of children online. They aren’t all the stereotypical loners of popular imagination – they are our friends, family, neighbours and colleagues. “Many of the men we work with move to viewing illegal material from an adult pornography habit, which some describe as an addiction. With the increase in online pornography viewing over lockdown, we’re worried that there will now be a new set of people, mostly men, moving on to looking at illegal sexual images of under-18s.” The Stop it Now! helpline is run by the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, a charity that provides specialist counselling to men who have been watching child abuse material.
The charity points to reports from Pornhub showed a substantial rise in individuals accessing legal pornography across the first Covid-19 lockdown in 2020. Lucy Faithfull counsellor Michael Sheath told the Guardian in December that legal rape- and abuse-themed pornography was desensitising some users, leading them on to illegal material. He said: “Typically these men I work with will have been watching porn that is freely available on the internet at eight, nine, 10 years old. This isn’t looking at naked ladies, it’s group sex, it’s rape-themed, incest-themed. Porn is an entry drug for a lot of them. They go down what I call an escalating pathway.” A large proportion of callers to the helpline who have offended online say they watched pornography excessively before seeking out sexual images of under-18s. Jennifer is an adviser taking calls on the helpline. She urged anyone to call if they were worried about their own or a family member’s behaviour online. “Feelings of isolation, stress … these are often what lead to escalating pornography habits and then in turn to illegal online behaviour,” she said. “Obviously for most people these worries don’t lead to offending, but for some people they do. We listen and don’t judge, as well as suggest practical things that will ultimately help keep children safe.”
New research out today from the charity showed two-thirds of UK adults wouldn’t seek help or advice if they knew or suspected their partner, parent or child was viewing sexual images or videos of under-18s online. Police and child abuse experts have warned that the fight to stop children being abused and their images shared is at risk because of plans to further encrypt social media sites including Facebook. Experts say scanning technologies will no longer be able to track suspicious activity as easily. Facebook has responded robustly to criticism from senior police officers and experts over encryption, saying “[We have] led the industry in developing new ways to prevent, detect and respond to abuse.” The NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000. The National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac) offers support for adult survivors on 0808 801 0331."
2021-03-01T12:29:40Z,global-development,Global development,"'Falling off a cliff': pandemic crippling world's most fragile states, finds report","Thousands could starve in the world’s most fragile states as the pandemic comes on top of existing crises, warns a new report today which found aid workers are deeply pessimistic about the coming year. The survey of aid workers by the Disaster Emergency Committee (DEC) found that they believed humanitarian conditions were at their worst in a decade. The chief executive of the DEC, Saleh Saeed, said reduced funding could force aid providers to prioritise some populations and services over others. “People living in places made perilous by conflict, violence and climate disasters are coping with the coronavirus pandemic as best they can, but the odds are stacked against them. The knock-on effects of the pandemic have crippled economies, making the world’s poorest people even poorer,” said Saeed. The report focused on Syria, Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Afghanistan, as well as the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh.
It said there had been a significant economic impact in all of these countries, but that the direct health impact of the coronavirus had also been underestimated because of insufficient testing capacity. Ahmed Khalif, country director for the charity Action Against Hunger in Somalia, said livelihoods had been damaged by drops in crucial livestock exports and remittances sent from the diaspora, coming alongside conflict, locust infestations and drought. “It’s multiple crises on a football field, rolling the ball to each other and we’re chasing between all these players on the field to catch up,” he said. He said the number of people in Somalia requiring humanitarian assistance had risen by 700,000 but aid had been difficult to provide in some areas because of restrictions. He also said 190,000 children aged under one had missed their vaccinations last year. Khalif said he was concerned about donor countries cutting or redirecting aid funding as Covid-19 cases rose by 52% in February in Somalia. “I would really urge donor countries to stand with the communities in fragile countries. It’s not of their making, it’s not their choice to remain in Somalia or Yemen.” A donors’ meeting hosted by the UN today is calling for $3.85bn (£2.75bn) to support Yemen, which is facing the world’s worst famine in decades. The UN’s head of humanitarian relief, Mark Lowcock, told reporters last week: “The humanitarian situation is falling off a cliff.”"
2021-03-01T06:30:15Z,global-development,Global development, ‘Help and you are a criminal’: the fight to defend refugee rights at Europe's borders,"At the offices of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group in Budapest, András Léderer and his colleagues have a map on which they track every asylum seeker – man, woman or child – who has been physically pushed back by police from the Hungarian border and into the forests of Serbia. The pushbacks are illegal under international law. Yet it is Léderer and his fellow human rights activists who could face arrest and a jail sentence if they went to the border to witness what is happening there. “We aren’t allowed to go to the border,” says Léderer. In 2018 it became illegal to help migrants claim asylum and this includes a ban on visiting the border. “Until the Covid lockdown we went to Serbia to speak to people, to record the stories of violence and humiliation, but we can’t even travel now. People are being beaten, dogs are used against them, their shoes taken, they have cold water thrown over them. It still happens but we can’t see it.” All across Europe – from the Serbian forests to the Aegean Sea – asylum seekers are pushed back from the borders in their thousands. As the authorities increasingly turn their attention to stopping the work of human rights activists and observers, much of it is happening without witnesses.
“It’s hard to imagine,” says Léderer. “Anyone who is caught by the authorities or who approaches them to ask for asylum, they are taken in a car or a van immediately to the border with Serbia. There is no hearing, no administrative work. The police open a gate in the border fence and they literally push them into open forest, women, children, everyone.”
The Geneva convention on refugees states that signatory nations shall not impose penalties on people arriving without formal authorisation because they are escaping persecution. But rights groups are warning that violent and illegal pushbacks of migrants across Europe are rising. “We are globally in a worse place for people seeking asylum than at any time I can remember,” says Steve Valdez-Symonds, migration director at Amnesty International. “The situation with pushbacks is significantly worsening, just look at Greece. But this is partly because of a complete failure of solidarity right across Europe.” With the increasing violence against those attempting to claim asylum comes attacks on the human rights defenders, lawyers, volunteers and NGOs trying to help them. Earlier this month the Greek group Mare Liberum issued a report with other NGOs, describing an “unprecedented escalation of human rights violations in the Aegean, both at sea and on land”. The report documents more than 9,000 people on the move from March to December who were violently pushed back to Turkey and deprived of their right to asylum. But this monitoring is under threat, it says. Last September, 25 police and special forces boarded its ship to search it and confiscated phones and computers. Greek authorities have repeatedly denied allegations of pushbacks and have even called them “Turkish propaganda”. The Greek migration minister, Notis Mitarachi, has accused groups rescuing refugees at sea of people-smuggling. The hostility on the ground has also affected those seeking asylum. Last November, a 25-year-old man from Afghanistan was charged by Greek authorities with endangerment of a minor, after his six-year-old son drowned on the crossing from Turkey to Samos.
If they make it through Greece, families can be pushed back at multiple places in the Balkans, from Bosnia or Romania back into Serbia. At every point activists monitor rights abuses and provide humanitarian support. Prof Sue Clayton interviewed activists working with migrants across Europe for her book, The New Internationalists: Activist Volunteers in the European Refugee Crisis. She told the Guardian: “I spoke to hundreds of grassroots volunteers across Europe who’ve stepped in where countries are failing – first to keep people alive, and increasingly to monitor state violence against migrants. “Now these volunteers supporting them are also being increasingly criminalised. Governments don’t want this human rights work taking place because they want to press ahead with their ‘Fortress Europe’ plan.”
Isabella Anderson works for Human Rights Observers in Calais. She says that even though legally she is allowed to carry out her monitoring work, the police make it difficult. “The evictions go on throughout the cold winter weather, throughout the lockdown. We were fined 30 times during the recent lockdown for breaking ‘confinement’ rules while we conducted our human rights observations. In January alone we experienced violence from the police 61 times. I had a policeman driving and revving towards me as six others pushed me about. I have had a police officer pushing me and saying, ‘I am the law’. “Every time I go face to face with police, my heart beats faster and I think: I don’t want to do this. We are unarmed, they are armed.”
In Budapest, Léderer says the law that bans people helping asylum seekers has a chilling effect. “It hangs there as a sword of Damocles. We work with difficulty, we provide legal assistance, we try to litigate against pushbacks, but we can’t monitor violence at the border now. “The law has a very chilling effect here. To help refugees means you risk being a criminal so people prefer not to get involved. The number of groups providing assistance has shrunk significantly and state authorities are very reluctant to cooperate with us.”
Yet despite all they are up against, the activists say their work is challenging the anti-asylum narrative. Last week the advocate general of the European court of justice, the EU’s highest court, issued a statement advising that the Hungarian government’s crackdown on groups that support or advise asylum seekers is illegal under European law. In December the European court of justice ruled that Hungary’s policy of refusing to let people claim asylum is a breach of EU law. Since then, in January alone, Léderer has counted 4,903 pushbacks. He sends this evidence on to the EU.
Frontex, the EU border agency, announced last month that it would no longer be able to operate in Hungary because of unlawful pushbacks. “Despite the laws that criminalise our work we are still working and helping these people. And we fought for five years to get to the point last month where Frontex had to leave Hungary because of the evidence we gave of illegal pushbacks, so although we are not popular here, we have some optimism,” says Léderer. The Hungarian government responded to the judgment of the advocate general saying it stood by its policies: “The commission and the advocate general, unfortunately, agree that it is completely acceptable to support, facilitate and organise illegal migration. In contrast, the Hungarian criminal code classifies these activities as a criminal offence. The government will continue to protect the borders of Hungary and Europe and will do its utmost to prevent the creation of international migrant corridors.” In response to recent criticism of police actions, the prefecture of Pas-de-Calais said that the evictions “put an end to illegal occupations … with a twofold objective: to prevent the reconstitution of insalubrious camps and to provide shelter for the migrant population”. It added: “The action of the police during these operations responds to strict rules of ethics.” • This article was amended on 3 March 2021 to make clear that the Geneva convention on refugees obliges countries to avoid penalising people fleeing persecution who enter without authorisation. An earlier story version said the convention conferred such entry as a refugee right."
2021-03-01T06:01:15Z,global-development,Global development,"More than 75% of Syrian refugees may have PTSD, says charity","More than three-quarters of Syrian refugees may be suffering serious mental health symptoms, 10 years after the start of the civil war. A UK charity is calling for more investment in mental health services for refugees in several countries after it found symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were widespread in a survey of displaced Syrians. Syria Relief said refugees and people internally displaced by the conflict struggled to find support. A survey of 721 Syrians living in Lebanon, Turkey and in Idlib in Syria’s north-west found 84% had at least seven out of 15 key symptoms of PTSD. “I don’t leave the home at all, I just stay in the tent. Sometimes, I have episodes of stress where I feel like breaking everything and hit my husband,” said one woman in Lebanon, who did not want to be named. She said she has struggled to recover from years of accumulating tragedy through the war, including the battle for Aleppo in 2015, losing a newborn child to illness and surviving an attempted rape by a man pretending to offer her work. She was eventually referred to a doctor who prescribed her medication. She said it has been hard to find the medicine recently because of drug shortages in Lebanon.
According to Syria Relief’s report, only 15% of refugees in Lebanon say mental health support is available for them. Among displaced Syrians in Idlib the figure falls to 1%. Only two out of 393 people who took part in the survey showed no symptoms linked to PTSD in Idlib, the last rebel stronghold against President Bashar al-Assad’s forces. Ibrahim Hanano, a council member in the border town Tel al-Karameh, said there was a desperate need for support in rural areas like his. “There are huge amounts of people who need this kind of support. I can’t even count them. There are people who are really unable to recover, they have severe psychological and physical injuries,” he said. “The only thing we can do is to try to document their situation so that if the local NGOs come to the area we will tell them.” Ahmad al-Mousa, 24, was badly hurt when a barrel bomb hit his home in Tel al-Karameh in 2014. He said loud sounds, especially of aircraft overhead, still instantly trigger fear for him. He has not found any help for his condition. “I can’t describe how I would feel if I could get rid of this issue, if I could recover fully, if I could feel equal to other people,” said Mousa.
Syria Relief’s head of communications and advocacy, Charles Lawley, the report’s author, said: “We have a lot more success in getting aid for physical issues like food or schools. This is the damage you can see from the war, but what I wanted to give a picture of is there is a huge amount of damage you can’t see – the mental trauma.” Diana Rayes, a US-based researcher on mental health among displaced Syrians, said Syria Relief’s survey was not large enough to draw conclusions from, but showed the need for more attention to be paid to the issue. “We know for a fact there’s been multigenerational impacts of PTSD and trauma on the population. We know this is going to affect the children born throughout the conflict,” said Rayes, a PhD candidate at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
She said it was important to address mental health and trauma, especially as many Syrians now feel the war has been forgotten. “I don’t think the feeling of being forgotten makes things better. I think this is going to be a question for the future of Syria … it’s unlikely that Syrians will ever return to the country if they don’t feel they’ve reconciled with their trauma.” More than 5.6 million people have fled Syria since 2011 and 6.6 million have been internally displaced."
2021-02-28T11:00:12Z,global-development,Global development,Chile emerges as global leader in Covid inoculations with 'pragmatic strategy',"Chile has administered more than 3.1m vaccine doses in just three weeks to emerge as a global leader in Covid-19 inoculations, trailing only the US, UK, UAE and Israel in vaccination doses per 100 people. Having initially endured heavy criticism over its handling of pandemic restrictions, Chile has moved quickly to secure vaccines from a range of suppliers and aims to have 80% of its population immunised against the virus by June. It has already vaccinated 16% of its 19 million citizens at hospitals, schools, stadia and municipal buildings throughout the country. “Chile can be proud of its inoculation process,” said the health minister, Enrique Paris, who assumed the role in June 2020 after his predecessor resigned amid a surging caseload. “To get to this point, we began work in May last year to guarantee that a sufficient quantity of safe and effective vaccines would be available to all Chileans.” The successful vaccine campaign stands in stark contrast with neighbouring countries. Chile’s vaccination rate of 16.78 doses per 100 people far outstrips the regional average of 2.83. Brazil, whose president, Jair Bolsonaro, has dismissed the virus as a “little flu”, has so far managed to vaccinate 3.67% of its population – but surpassed another grim milestone this week with 250,000 Covid-19 deaths recorded. Across the Andes, Argentina has administered 1.84 doses per 100 people. No other South American country has managed to vaccinate more than 1% of its population. Chile’s mass inoculation campaign began with those aged 90 and over on 3 February, and after administering more than 1m vaccinations in its first week has now covered 1.9 million people over the age of 65. A pathway has been laid out for the country to achieve herd immunity by June. In the current phase, over-65s, transplant recipients and those requiring dialysis are being vaccinated, while the latest shipment of Pfizer-BioNTech and SinoVac will also allow for 250,000 teachers to be given a first dose ahead of a return to school on 1 March. People aged between 60 and 64 will be targeted next, and from 8 March, anyone suffering from a chronic illness will be eligible to receive a vaccine. More than 20,000 people have died having contracted the virus in Chile, where 812,344 have tested positive for Covid-19 – with 39% of these infections concentrated in the capital, Santiago. While lockdowns have eased and tightened again over the summer months through a set of tiered restrictions, 30 of Chile’s 346 districts are currently in lockdown, with two more joining them from 27 February. A nationwide curfew remains in place, limiting movement between 11pm and 5am. “We have followed a pragmatic strategy,” said Rodrigo Yáñez, the undersecretary in Chile’s trade ministry, who has been tasked with securing vaccine supply. “We considered the technical and scientific merit of each vaccine rather than political factors and have reached agreements with a number of laboratories in case supply should slow down.” A state budget of $200m was set aside for the vaccination programme, although the overall cost could rise to nearer $300m, according to Yáñez. Chile has bought more than 35m vaccine doses, including 7.8m through the global Covax scheme, 10m each from the SinoVac Biotech and Pfizer laboratories, and further supplies from AstraZeneca – the only three manufacturers whose vaccines the country has approved to date. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first to arrive on 24 December, with 20,000 doses used to vaccinate healthcare workers in direct contact with the virus, and other vaccines produced by the Johnson & Johnson and CanSino laboratories – both of which are single-dose – are currently being trialled in the country. Chile is also considering buying further supplies from the Sputnik V and CureVac laboratories. With vaccine doses delivered 28 days apart, the mass campaign to administer second doses will begin on 3 March – a year to the day since the first case of Covid-19 was detected in Chile."
2021-02-26T07:30:09Z,global-development,Global development,‘Doctors are paying for supplies': inside a stretched Burkina Faso Covid ward,"When stocks of medical equipment in the general ward of Tengandogo University hospital in Ouagadougou ran low as resources flowed to the coronavirus unit, medical staff bought the essentials themselves. Blood pressure monitors, glucose monitors and oximeters were needed. Even the ink in the printers had to be replaced. The hospital closed to non-Covid patients during Burkina Faso’s first wave in March but reopened in July to treat the numerous other illnesses that affect the population of approximately 20 million people. Without any emergency budget for resources, doctors faced a challenge. “The pandemic has had a big impact on resources, especially things like oxygen that are needed for coronavirus treatment,” Dr Lassina Séré, a senior practitioner, told the Guardian. “In terms of equipment, some things that the hospital used to be able to pay for are no longer covered by the budget because it’s all been used on Covid, so what the doctors have done is start initiatives to buy what’s needed ourselves.” Tengandogo is one of Burkina Faso’s leading health institutions. A sprawling blush pink complex, it’s eerily quiet. There is no buzz of machines or the drone of a hospital intercom. It’s a private facility that treats the country’s most critical patients, but since March it has treated people with coronavirus without charge. Before the pandemic this landlocked country had a shortage of specialist staff, especially in rural areas where the quality of care is considerably lower. Poor salaries coupled with growing insecurity in the north and east due to militant violence have led many young professionals to leave, and deterred others from coming. In Tengandogo, the staff are overworked, and when some have had to self-isolate, it has been a struggle.
“We had to create a new Covid area in the hospital. We couldn’t hire new personnel, so we had to take from the regular staff, which means there are shortages on the other services,” says Dr Moussa Kabré, head of the general ward. The slight 41-year-old is exhausted, and says recent months have been among the most challenging of his career. Respiratory diseases such as pneumonia are the leading cause of death in Burkina Faso. Dr Christian Jules Wenl Minoungou, head of respiratory medicine at Tengandogo, has struggled to access resources. One patient under his care, 23-year-old Philomon, has been in the general ward for two months with an undisclosed respiratory disease. His body has wasted away and speaking has become uncomfortable. On the floor next to him sits his tired mother, Delphin. “My only hope is for my son to get better and recover,” she says.
“There are only 30 lung specialists in this country,” says Minoungou. “Pneumonia is the first cause of death here and if you don’t act quickly the situation deteriorates. We need more resources to deal with it. People are always coming in from the countryside in an advanced condition because they are unable to get care there.” The director of Tengandogo, Ferdinand Tiendrébéogo, agrees: “When you look at the figures, coronavirus is not a priority. It’s very small compared to, say, malaria. That said, you do need to keep an eye on Covid because you never know what can happen with it, but overall it’s been a very resource-intensive disease for this hospital.” Crossing the threshold into the ICU at Tengandogo, the quiet is replaced by the steady beat of heart monitors. A handful of nurses care for four Covid patients and the 12 other patients who are at the other end of the ward. Some of the staff are in full PPE, others wear only mask and gloves. In the corner by the door is a pile of discarded garments.
Ally Ouattara, the unit’s head nurse, is six hours into his shift. The smile behind his mask reaches his eyes and he stands out in brightly patterned scrubs. He carefully recounts the details of each of his Covid patients. Two men in their 60s with underlying health conditions. A middle-aged woman with a history of TB. The fourth, Ismail, 50, is being moved to the recovery ward after eight days. It’s a moment of celebration for the staff in a ward where the Covid survival rate is 50%. According to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been 11,847 lab-confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Burkina Faso and 139 deaths. The true figure is thought to be higher as testing is limited to about 2,000 rapid tests a day. Track and trace is nonexistent and daily life for millions of people continues as normal despite some earlier restrictions. Since late November the Burkinabé have seen a second wave that led to a spike in admissions and renewed fears that hospitals could be overrun. Dr Brice Wilfried, the director of Corus, Burkina Faso’s health emergencies organisation, says the second spike is in decline, after a fall in cases over the past two weeks.
Dr Jerry-Jonas Mbasha, health cluster coordinator for the World Health Organization in Burkina Faso, says: “We need to understand the fragility of the health system here before Covid-19 and what’s happened over the last year is a significant amount of extra stress. There already was a strategy to identify specific respiratory diseases across the country and what we did to ensure that continued to function was integrate Covid testing into that structure and that’s been quite effective.” For Séré, Covid is more of an economic problem than a health emergency. “It’s changed our access to resources and the attention it’s getting here is disproportionate compared to the impact,” he says. Like his colleagues, he believes that quality care has to continue for all patients even if it means financing it from their own pockets."
2021-02-26T06:30:08Z,global-development,Global development,Pakistan passes ‘historic’ bill banning corporal punishment of children ,"Pakistan has passed a bill banning corporal punishment for children in a move described as “historic” by rights activists. It comes amid a number of high-profile cases of schoolchildren being badly beaten and even killed in schools, religious institutions and workplaces. Last month, an eight-year-old boy was beaten to death by his teacher for not memorising a lesson in a madrasa – a religious school – in Punjab province. In June 2020, another eight-year-old, a girl working as a maid in Islamabad, was beaten to death by her employers for letting their pet parrots escape. These and other incidents, including disturbing mobile phone footage widely posted on social media, prompted nationwide debate on a ban in a country where physical punishment is commonplace. The bill, passed by the National Assembly, includes penalties for beating children, and bans all types of corporal punishment at formal and informal workplaces and in various educational settings including religious, government and private institutions. There is a patchwork of corporal punishment legislation in Pakistan’s different states, and the current bill applies to Islamabad only, but it is thought the rest of the country will eventually follow suit. “It is historic for Pakistan to pass a bill consensually for the wellbeing of children. Children have always remained voiceless in our society,” politician Mehnaz Akbar Aziz, who tabled the legislation, told the Guardian. “Corporal punishment is on the rise in this country. Until now the state had no measures in place to intervene in such situations of violence. The law on prohibition of children’s corporal punishment is the first bill that serves the purpose of ensuring the physical and mental wellbeing of children in Pakistan.” Musician Shehzad Roy is the founder of Zindagi Trust, which has been campaigning on the issue for a decade. Last year, he filed a petition in Islamabad high court to ban hitting children. In 2020, Justice Athar Minallah advised the National Assembly to adopt the bill.
“Back in 2013, Dr Attiya Inayatullah passed a bill against corporal punishment in the National Assembly that didn’t pass in the Senate. We are expecting that this time the Senate would pass the bill too and all provincial assemblies follow it,” said Roy. The challenge would be to formulate detailed rules for legal institutions and government ministries to oversee and enforce the legislation, he said. Pakistan’s human rights minister, Shireen Mazari, who presented an amendment to the bill to ensure punishment for offenders and to give children access to justice, said: “We are hopeful the bill will make a difference.” Children’s rights activist and lawyer Syed Miqdad Mehdi said the biggest hurdle was section 89 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which allowed teachers, parents and guardians to punish children in “good faith”. The new bill is designed to close that loophole at a time when Pakistan has 24 million children out of school. “Many children quit schools due to punishment,” said Mehdi. “The law brings a deterrence. It needs to be implemented.” Roy said the tragedy was that corporal punishment is ingrained in Pakistani society – from home to school to the police force – and that violence was seen as a way to resolve issues. More work needed to be done, he said. Child protection units must be set up and a system put in place to ensure a proper reporting procedure. “We need to challenge this mentality. Beating children does not aid them in any way. Instead, it kills their creativity and is a breach of fundamental rights. Children must be made to feel dignified.”"
2021-02-25T15:48:50Z,global-development,Global development,Myanmar military supporters attack anti-coup protesters,"Supporters of Myanmar’s military armed with iron rods, catapults and knives have attacked anti-coup protesters in Yangon after weeks of rallies calling for the return of democracy in the country. At least two people were stabbed in the attacks, which occurred after hundreds of pro-military demonstrators marched through central Yangon towards the main railway station. Pro-democracy supporters met them with crossed wrists, banging pots and pans. It was the first large pro-military rally since the army seized power on 1 February, and it was just a fraction of the size of recent demonstrations held to oppose the coup. Some participants damaged cars, punched bystanders and threatened reporters who were following the march. A photographer said one shot a stone from a catapult that cut his leg. “I ran together with the residents into their ward,” he said. “They helped a lot and supported media there. I saw six people injured, and the residents also detained about 20 pro-military supporters, but they were released after the police arrived.” In a separate incident in the evening, police reportedly opened fire as residents in Yangon held a protest to oppose the replacement of their administrator with a military appointee. Social media footage, apparently taken in Tamwe township on Thursday evening, also showed police firing at balconies.
Mass protests have occurred in Myanmar for weeks since the military seized power and detained politicians from the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD). Events since the coup, including deadly violence, prompted Facebook to ban the Myanmar military on Thursday, including from Instagram. It cited “exceptionally severe human rights abuses and the clear risk of future military-initiated violence in Myanmar”. The company said it would also ban all “Tatmadaw-linked commercial entities” from advertising on its platforms. The UK announced further measures, expanding sanctions to six more military figures in the junta, who are banned from travelling to the country. Businesses and institutions are also prevented from dealing with their funds or economic resources in the UK. “My message to the people of Myanmar is simple,” said the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab. “The UK is working closely with our international partners to support your right to democracy and freedom of expression.” Sanctions were already in place against 19 military figures. Three people have been killed at protests since the coup, and one man was shot while taking part in a volunteer patrol to protect his neighbours from night-time raids by the authorities. Another man is also reported to have died after being arrested following a police crackdown on protests in Mandalay. The authorities claimed he had died of Covid, his wife told Myanmar Now. He did not have symptoms when he was arrested, she said, but had been shot and severely beaten. A medic earlier reported that she had been denied permission to treat him. Human rights experts have welcomed Facebook’s decision to ban the military, but say it was long overdue. Phil Robertson, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division, saidthe company would need to continue to monitor the military’s activity on its platform closely. “Of course the military is going to try to figure out how to evade this. They’re going to come up with new accounts … This is a cat and mouse game and they need to be prepared to follow up,” he said.
Facebook is the main means of communication in Myanmar, but was blocked by the military in the aftermath of the coup as it sought to stop the public from organising protests to oppose its power grab. Twitter and Instragram were also blocked. Many have got around such restrictions by using virtual private networks (VPNs), and both journalists and members of the public have used social media to livestream rallies and document police violence and nighttime arrests. Despite attempting to restrict access to Facebook, the junta had also continued to use the platform to announce news and share propaganda. The military has promised to hold fresh elections in a year’s time, but protesters are sceptical. Aung San Suu Kyi has been detained incommunicado since the coup at her home in the capital, Naypyitaw, and faces two charges, including allegations of illegally importing walkie talkies. If convicted, she may be prevented from running in any future elections. At least 728 people have been arrested, charged or sentenced in relation to the pro-democracy protests, according to the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners."
2021-02-25T07:15:20Z,global-development,Global development,Malawi MPs debate bill to liberalise abortion laws as churches oppose,"A bill to liberalise Malawi’s abortion laws will be debated by MPs on Thursday in the face of opposition from faith groups. If passed, the termination of pregnancy bill would allow abortions when a woman’s mental or physical health is in danger, in cases of rape and incest, and when there are serious foetal abnormalities. Currently, abortion is only permitted to save a woman’s life and campaigners have been lobbying for change for many years. The bill has been proposed by MP Matthews Ngwale, who said change was needed after “observing that there are an ever increasing number of justifiable situations for the termination of unwanted pregnancies, which have not been covered by existing law”. “Many people think that we want to make abortion [in its entirety] legal or allow abortion on demand. But abortion is already allowed in our laws and what we’re doing is to increase the situations where this can be allowed, that’s all,” he added. Pro-choice campaigners believe almost half of the 193 MPs in the national assembly back the bill, but there is strong opposition. The Episcopal Conference of Malawi, the Evangelical Association of Malawi, Malawi Council of Churches and the Muslim Association of Malawi have long resisted any attempt to change the law. Attempts to introduce the bill in 2016 were rejected after protests. Henry Saindi, secretary general of the Episcopal Conference, said: “It is only God who can give or take life irrespective of whatever circumstance that has happened. Human life remains sacred and it must be preserved, promoted and defended.
“The bill does not reflect our values, our culture and our aspirations as the nation.” Research by the Guttmacher Institute, which advocates for sexual and reproductive health, and the University of Malawi College of Medicine, published in 2017 – the latest date for which figures are available – estimated that 141,000 women in Malawi had an abortion in 2015, and that 60% of these resulted in complications that required treatment. Between 6% and 18% of maternal deaths in Malawi are estimated to be the result of complications from unsafe abortion. “Most people in the rural areas – and the people are very poor, too – resort to using sticks like cassava, bicycle spokes, and take dangerous drugs and concoctions to terminate pregnancy,” said Dr Amos Nyaka of the Coalition for Prevention of Unsafe Abortion. “This leads to pain and suffering.” Brian Ligomeka, director of the Centre for Solutions Journalism, a human rights media organisation that has been lobbying for the bill, said the legal changes would save lives. “The debate about abortion is not about right or wrong, sin or righteousness, as some assume. It is about how to save the desperate woman who wants to induce an abortion using toxic substances or dangerous objects.” Losing thousands of women every year to abortion “should move our MPs to pass the law”, he said."
2021-02-25T07:14:23Z,global-development,Global development,Ghanaian LGBTQ+ centre closes after threats and abuse,"A community centre for LGBTQ+ people in Ghana has been closed, following a wave of protest against the rights of sexual minorities in the country. In recent weeks government ministers and religious groups had demanded the closure of the centre, intended to be a safe space for LGBTQ+ people to meet and find support. Yet since the opening in January of the centre in the capital, Accra, many people have received death threats and online abuse. The centre was closed preemptively, its founder said, to protect its staff. Although same-sex relationships are illegal in Ghana, the law is rarely enforced, according to a 2018 report by Human Rights Watch. However, the opening of the centre amplified discrimination against the community, said activists. Fatima Derby, a feminist writer, said LGBTQ+ Ghanaians were “under threat” after the “uproar” caused by the opening of the centre. “It’s really disappointing the way the space has been treated. It’s also really disappointing the way LGBTQI+ individuals have been treated by politicians, religious leaders and even ordinary citizens. “For a long period of time, LGBTQ Ghanaians have been treated as disposable, but I think now it is becoming more amplified,” she said. “A lot of politicians have used this opportunity to gain favour once again from the electorate by being homophobic, because they know the population is largely homophobic.” Last week, Sarah Adwoa Safo, newly elected minister for gender and children, told a parliamentary committee: “The issue of LGBTQI is an issue that when mentioned creates some controversy, but what I want to say is that our laws are clear on such practices. It makes it criminal. “The criminality of LGBT is non-negotiable and our cultural practices also frown on it.” At a recent press conference, Ghana’s information minister, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, said the government was considering introducing legislation against LGBTQ+ advocacy. “We should be able to contemplate legislation in the interest of public morality, which will not be against the constitution but will now say that you cannot advocate for and promote LGBT activities in this country,” he said.
The community centre was set up by LGBT+ Rights Ghana. A fundraising event to mark the opening was attended by the Danish ambassador, the Australian high commissioner and EU delegates, which caused outrage and prompted repeated claims that the international community was promoting LGBTQ+ rights. On Saturday, the Ghana Catholic church bishops’ conference released a statement demanding the centre be shut down and condemned “all those who support the practice of homosexuality in Ghana”. “The EU should not impose their so-called values and beliefs on Ghanaians who are also against homosexuality,” it said. It urged the government “never to be cowed down or to succumb to the pressure to legalise the rights of LGBTQIs in Ghana”. The bishops’ comments made the front pages of a number of newspapers on Monday. In response to the criticism, the EU diplomatic mission in Ghana posted a message of support on Facebook saying: “Equality, tolerance and respect for each other are core values of the EU. The EU supports civil society organisations promoting #LGBTIQ rights.” Derby said claims that being gay went against Ghanaian culture, or was a result of western influence, were false and propagated by the church and the media. On Tuesday, LGBT+ Rights Ghana tweeted that its offices had been raided and closed down by the police. The organisation had already received threats from opposition groups that the community centre would be destroyed. On Monday, it urged people in the community not to panic but to stay safe. “This is not the best time to invite strangers over or visit strangers,” said the organisation, which was founded in 2018 to provide support for LGBTQ+ Ghanaians. People should “avoid staying alone in risk zones”, it added. In an earlier statement the group said: “The fundraising activity [at the centre] has unfortunately sparked negative reporting riddled with false narrations in the Ghanaian media. We have the right as Ghanaians to live in peace, join groups, be protected from harm and have our privacy respected.”"
2021-02-24T11:00:16Z,global-development,Global development,Mexican president under fire for defending politician accused of rape,"A growing row over a gubernatorial candidate facing accusations of rape has once again pitted Mexico’s populist president against women’s rights campaigners. Félix Salgado Macedonio has registered to run for governor in southern Guerrero state with the ruling Morena party, despite accusations of sexual violence and rape by five women dating back as far as 1998. Salgado has remained silent as the outrage over the accusations mounted, though his lawyer José Luis Gallegos insisted “there’s no proof” and called the accusations “stories of invented crimes”, according to the newspaper Reforma. Salgado has not been charged with any crimes. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has doggedly defended Salgado even as demands escalate for the president to dump him as a candidate. López Obrador initially dismissed the complaints as “politicking” and then alleged that the attacks on Salgado were little more than a ruse against the president himself, saying it was part of a campaign of “media lynching”. Women in Mexico have responded to Salgado’s candidacy – and the president’s defence of him – with a social media campaign, in which they posted pictures of themselves holding signs reading “President, break the pact”, a reference to rampant machismo in Mexican politics. “This is the opportunity for the president and Morena [López Obrador’s party] to demonstrate that they really are different and have some decency,” tweeted the writer Alma Delia Murillo, who sent the hashtag #RompeElPacto trending. “Don’t make a pact with machismo by vouching for a candidate like Félix Salgado.” Amlo, as the president is known, greeted such calls with the terse comment: “Ya chole!” – “Enough already!” He later said: “They’re linking me to the Félix Salgado case, and there’s a media lynching campaign in all the radio programs, all the press against Félix.” The episode has again placed Amlo in conflict with women’s rights campaigners and the country’s burgeoning feminist movement.
Throughout his term, Amlo has dismissed protests calling for action against Mexico’s plague of femicides with derision and accusations of conspiracy. He has claimed without evidence that Mexico’s women’s movement has been infiltrated by “conservatives” as a Trojan horse to attack his administration. His government slashed funding for women’s programs and shelters, even as domestic violence surged amid coronavirus lockdowns. “Amlo doesn’t get the feminist agenda,” said Bárbara González, a political analyst in Monterrey. “For him, these demands are a distraction from his agenda. It’s something for elites, conservatives and people trying to impede his plans.” His plans include retaining control of congress and sweeping gubernatorial races in nearly half of Mexico’s 32 states in the 6 June midterm elections. Morena, the party founded by Amlo in 2014, often picks its candidates through polling, though Amlo has the last word on nominations, González said. Salgado, a senator with a leave of absence, leads polls in Guerrero, which lies to the south of Mexico City and includes some of the country’s most marginalised and violent municipalities. Nicknamed “El Toro”, Salgado was mayor of Acapulco between 2006 and 2008, when drug cartel violence exploded in what once was the grandaddy of Mexican tourist destinations. He also has a long history of loyalty to Amlo, along with patronage networks across the state, according to analysts. Female members of Morena have urged Amlo to abandon Salgado and the party’s honesty and justice commission is investigating the accusations against Salgado. But the Morena party president, Mario Delgado, has said Salgado can run so long as he isn’t convicted or sentenced. “Everything is made so [Salgado] is never sentenced and, in reality, almost no man is ever convicted for sexual violence,” said Paola Zavala Saeb, a lawyer and director of Ocupa México, a violence prevention organisation. “Just 2% of sexual violence complaints end up with a sentence.”"
2021-02-24T06:30:02Z,global-development,Global development,"Yazidis have been forgotten during Covid. They need justice, jobs and a return home | Nadia Murad","Staring at the same four walls day after day, unable to find work, reunite with relatives, or send your children to school. The Covid pandemic has rendered this bleak picture a reality for many people across the globe. Yet for many who have survived or are living through conflict, these hardships are hardly novel. For the Yazidi ethnic minority in Iraq, Islamic State’s 2014 genocide created adversity long before the pandemic ever did. For more than six years, hundreds of thousands of Yazidis have been in camps for internally displaced people (IDP) staring at the same four walls of their tents. They are unable to find work because Isis razed their farms and businesses. They cannot reunite with relatives still in Isis captivity or attend the burials of family members whose bodies remain in mass graves. It will come as no surprise that the pandemic has made matters worse. As countries turn inward to cope with Covid’s impact, those on the periphery of protection – the displaced, conflict-afflicted and survivors of sexual violence – are pushed further into the margins. The consequences of this abandonment will probably be just as deadly and even more protracted than the pandemic. At present, these consequences manifest in increased vulnerability to the Covid virus and a sharp decline in mental health. In the first 16 days of 2021, 11 young Yazidis took their own lives. Clustered cases of suicide have been surfacing in IDP camps since the 2014 genocide, but a precise picture of Yazidi mental health trends is muddled by a lack of resources for research and a failure to respond to the issue’s root causes.
There is no doubt that the atrocities perpetrated by Isis – including massacres, enslavement, conscription and rape – have inflicted communal and individual trauma. A study published in 2018 by BMC Medicine found that more than 80% of participants (Yazidi women, aged 17 to 75) met the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder. The rates reached nearly 100% for women who had survived captivity. It is clear that in the absence of adequate support Isis’s violence continues to harm Yazidis. But this is not the only factor exacerbating the community’s vulnerability; the trauma of genocide is continuously compounded by poverty. Even before the Yazidi genocide, an International Organization for Migration (IOM) report identified high rates of suicide in Sinjar which it partially attributed to the lack of economic opportunity, security and religious freedom. Each of these root problems has been aggravated by genocide, displacement and the pandemic. Yet efforts to comprehensively address them by sustainably redeveloping Sinjar are deferred and deprioritised time and again by national governments and international agencies.
Earlier this month, my organisation Nadia’s Initiative met a committee of Yazidis to discuss their needs. Female survivors were unanimous in their priorities. Foremost is the desire for justice – for courts to try to sentence Isis perpetrators for their crimes of sexual violence and genocide. Trials would serve to hold these criminals accountable. Perhaps more importantly, they would provide a formal acknowledgment of the harm and trauma endured by survivors and a recognition that the criminality of rape lies with the abuser, not the victims. Such an acknowledgment would hopefully help survivors reintegrate into their communities and lessen the emotional load of injustice. The second – but equally critical – priority identified by the committee is livelihood support. A handful of organisations offer limited psychological care, but therapy is not a remedy for lack of income, clean water, education and healthcare. Yazidi survivors see work as a form of therapy. It keeps hands and minds busy, puts food on tables and revitalises communities. Livelihood opportunities generate hope to replace the despair that has settled in our hearts. However neither of these priorities will be met until Yazidis are able to voluntarily and safely return home to a dignified living environment. The governments of Baghdad and Erbil have the ability to restore local governance, security and basic services in Sinjar, but political disputes have consistently undermined durable solutions. To governments and foreign actors, Sinjar is one piece on a political chess board. But for Yazidis, it is our home, dignity, livelihoods and mental health that are sacrificed for their strategic interests. The international community must pair on-the-ground support with diplomatic pressure on Iraqi stakeholders for the sake of stabilising the Sinjar region. The needs of many post-conflict communities have been deprioritised during the Covid pandemic. Their pathways to recovery face insurmountable odds with an international community that often neglects to provide comprehensive support to those most marginalised. Discussions around Covid’s impact must include and be led by these communities. It is vital that we use the opportunity to rebuild from Covid to spotlight the compounded effects of the pandemic on post-conflict communities and empower them to develop a healthier, more prosperous and more peaceful future.

2021-02-24T06:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,"Sri Lanka at 'tipping point’ with risk of return to past atrocities, activists warn","Sri Lanka could descend swiftly back into violence and human rights abuses unless decisive international action is taken, the UN high commissioner for human rights and civil rights groups warned. In a speech to the human rights council on Wednesday, Michelle Bachelet is expected to issue a stark warning that the Sri Lankan government has “closed the door” on ending impunity for past abuses and is facing a return to state repression of civil society and a militarisation of public institutions. In January, the UN high commissioner for human rights expressed alarm over “worrying trends” in the country since President Gotabaya Rajapaksa took office in 2019. In a damning report published last month, which will be formally presented to the council, Bachelet documented deepening impunity and obstruction of justice for atrocities committed during the brutal civil war of 1983–2009. In the report, Bachelet said: “Sri Lanka’s current trajectory sets the scene for the recurrence of the policies and practices that gave rise to grave human rights violations.”
Since 2020, the former army officer Rajapaksa has appointed at least 28 serving or former military and intelligence personnel to key posts, her report found. Some are senior officials implicated in alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the final years of the civil war, including army chief Shavendra Silva and defence secretary Kamal Gunaratne. Rajapaksa, who was defence secretary when his brother Mahinda was president from 2005 to 2015, oversaw the defeat of the Tamil Tigers in 2009. During this period, unlawful killings and forced disappearances were widespread. It has been estimated that about 40,000 Tamils were killed. The previous government had taken some steps towards accountability and war crimes tribunals, but these halted after Rajapaksa was elected in 2019. Last year, the government said it would no longer honour its commitments to a consensus agreed in 2015 to ensure truth, justice, reparation and an accountability mechanism for past abuses. The failure to deal with past atrocities continues to have “devastating effects on tens of thousands of family members from all communities”, who persist in seeking justice, reparations and truth about the fate of their loved ones, Bachelet said.
A number of UN officials and independent experts, including four former high commissioners signed a letter describing Bachelet’s report as a “compelling case” for decisive international action and praising its focus on prevention. They wrote: “In 2009 the international community failed Sri Lanka. We must not fail again.” Bachelet’s report documents a pattern of surveillance and harassment of civil society organisations and human rights defenders, which was echoed by activists who spoke to the Guardian. One said the situation for human rights and the rule of law was worsening on a “daily basis”.
Dharisha Bastians, a Sri Lankan journalist who wrote for the New York Times before being forced into exile by harassment and threats shortly after the 2019 election, said she hoped UN member states would heed Bachelet’s call. “None of us expected this crackdown to happen so quickly,” Bastians said. “It is very disturbing and unfortunately it is a pattern we have seen before. Sri Lanka is at a tipping point. “It is clear this government has no interest in advancing the cause of justice. On the contrary, every effort has been made by this government to obstruct justice. The president has set up a commission for political victimisation which has exonerated every single military officer accused of human rights violations, without even hearing from victims or hearing about the investigations. “In some of the cases, the officers are already on trial in court. The attorney general is being pressurised to drop cases, witnesses are being pressurised into recanting evidence and families are being harassed.” This was a “tragedy” for the families of the disappeared, she said, urging the international community to act. “The continued focus on impunity for attacks against journalists will help to keep my colleagues safer on the ground in Sri Lanka. The spotlight would send a message to the Sri Lankan government that the world will not turn its eyes away.” Activists and campaigners said intimidation and harassment of civil society in Sri Lanka had led to the shrinking of civil space, and had had a “chilling effect”.
Shreen Saroor, a rights activist who works with women’s groups in the north and east of Sri Lanka, said groups had been forced to disclose information, including staff home addresses and phone numbers, and had been asked for bank details, to check funding sources. “They want all charitable organisations and NGOs to register with the national secretariat for nongovernmental organisations, which comes under the defence secretary,” Saroor said. The defence secretary is Gunaratne, who was a unit commander at the end of the war, and is accused of war crimes.
“They are forcing us not to take foreign funding, unless we register with the defence secretary and we will need defence ministry approval for the work we do,” Saroor said. She has been told that her work with war-affected communities is now “illegitimate”.
Melissa Dring, campaign director of the UK-based Sri Lanka Campaign for Peace and Justice, said the situation on the ground for human rights was “getting worse on a daily basis”. Time was running out for the victims and survivors, she said. Since the beginning of the roadside protests by families of the disappeared, 78 people have died, she said. “The resilience and determination of these protesters, the majority of whom are women, who have continued their protests over years and often been subjected to intimidation and harassment by the security forces and other state officials, is amazing,” she said.
Meenakshi Ganguly, the south Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said: “If, now, the international community fails to act, starting with a strong resolution at the UN human rights council, there is every chance that there will be a repeat, even a rise, in the targeting of activists, critics, victim families and minority communities.” Amnesty International said in a recent report it had witnessed an “alarming crackdown” on civic space and the targeting of minorities, including Muslim communities, which make up 10% of Sri Lanka’s population. Earlier this month, a group of Muslim families launched a complaint to the UN human rights committee about Sri Lanka’s policy of enforced cremation of all those confirmed or suspected to have died with Covid-19, saying it breaches their religious rights and is causing “untold misery”. The Sri Lankan government has dismissed Bachelet’s findings of credible allegations of war crimes against senior government figures as “baseless”."
2021-02-24T04:19:40Z,global-development,Global development,Aung San Suu Kyi tattoos flourish among Myanmar's resistance ,"In the last three weeks, Ye, 37, has inked more images of Aung San Suu Kyi than throughout his 19 years of tattooing. “We love and respect her because she has sacrificed so much for us,” he says, showing a photo of his latest artwork – a lifelike rendering of the deposed Myanmar leader, complete with jasmine flowers, on a woman’s back. If fans of the Nobel laureate were on the fence about getting a tattoo in her honour before the military coup on February 1, they are no longer. Studios across the country have reported a surge in Aung San Suu Kyi ink – and some are using their profits to support the protest movement.
Aung San Suu Kyi, 75, remains in detention, facing charges of illegally importing walkie talkies and violating Myanmar’s natural disaster law. She faces up to three years in jail, with a court hearing reportedly set for 1 March. While she remains beloved inside Myanmar, her international reputation was irrevocably tarnished when she travelled to the international court of justice in The Hague to defend the army against claims that it had committed genocide against the Rohingya Muslims. Some say she was walking a tight-rope with the generals to preserve a fledgling democracy – in that sense, this is the fall. Others have labelled her a military apologist whose idea of equality falls short for persecuted minorities. Whatever happens to the leader, she will leave a complex legacy. But in Myanmar’s commercial capital Yangon – home to mass pro-democracy rallies in recent days – the picture is clearer.
“I don’t even have tattoos of my parents,” said Hlaing, 32, who described the coup as more painful than the six hours it took to complete her tribute to Aung San Suu Kyi on 3 February. “I felt wronged and oppressed, I had to get it.” Ye, who is working on a new Aung San Suu Kyi design, has collected donations for the country’s civil disobedience movement, which aims to deprive the military of a functioning administration through nation-wide strikes.
“The military plans to imprison her so she gets older, just like they did before,” he says. “If they didn’t lock her up for 15 years, our country would be more developed, but the military knows all about that.” Tattooing has formed part of Myanmar culture for centuries. Shan men in the north-east used waist-to-knee designs to symbolise virility, while in western Chin state elderly women still showcase the fading tradition of facial tattoos. Some believe the right depictions could offer magical protection. But the practice of tattooing was banned during the British counterinsurgency in the 1930s and returned to the mainstream only during the political and economic reforms of 2011. In Mandalay, tattoo artist Za responded to the coup by inking Aung San Suu Kyi designs for free, until 15 February, when he began charging $3.50 (£2.50). So far, he has completed about 70 and all the money raised has gone to civil servants on strike and others resisting the junta, he said. “Just yesterday I spent the entire time giving tattoos of her,” he says. “More people are getting them and that has allowed us to support the movement.” While getting their tattoos, most clients indulge in chatter about the coup and gossip about those who aren’t joining the civil disobedience movement. “The conversations are never ending,” he says.
Tin, a professional fighter, snuck in a visit to a Yangon tattoo studio in between training sessions of lethwei, an ancient sport. He does not care so much about the leader’s party, the National League for Democracy, he said. Just for the woman who the country affectionately dubs “Mother Suu”. “I got it to express my faith in her and my support for her,” he says. “I don’t care if it gets me into trouble with the regime one day.”"
2021-02-23T10:37:44Z,global-development,Global development,Colombia's 'capital of horror' despairs amid new wave of gang violence,"Clenching a fist, Tatiana Angulo talked about the killings of her neighbours’ two teenage sons. “They got mixed up in it,” said Angulo, 34, who runs a peace theatre group, reenacting the stories of local victims. “We used to be able to hang out and have a laugh on the street corners, but now that’s where the killings happen.” The port city of Buenaventura, on Colombia’s Pacific coast, has long been infamous as the “capital of horror”, with a history of brutal killings and “casas de pique”, or chop houses, where bodies were dismembered and dumped in the sea.
Recent weeks have seen a new wave of violence as armed gangs compete for territory in neighbourhoods and incite fear among the mainly Afro-Colombian population. “We’re literally scared for our lives. I’m scared for mine, at least,” said Angulo, wearing a T-shirt with the slogan “Let’s make a pact for peace”. Many Bonaverenses are scared to talk about what is happening for fear of reprisal. They say armed groups are active on social media and keep track of those who speak out against them. The Guardian spoke to more than 20 residents and to civic organisations about the violence. All said it was the worst they had experienced since the 2016 peace deal, which many hoped would bring an end to decades-long conflict across Colombia.
Violence intensified in the small city of around 400,000 people at the end of last year, when gunmen killed seven young men. An 8pm curfew has been in place since the killings. Two groups, Los Chotas and Los Espartanos, are behind the recent fighting. Both broke away from the now-defunct La Local, and authorities say they are involved in “illegal economies” and recruitment of children.
“In my neighbourhood, the recruitment of young people is happening a lot, children as young as nine or 10,” Mosquera said. Fighting has driven around 30 families from their homes in recent weeks, according to the municipal ombudsman’s office. Danelly Estupiñán, a social activist, arrived to meet the Guardian in a bullet-proof car, accompanied by two bodyguards. She has been forced to live under protection since the release of an investigation she worked on five years ago, exposing corruption in the city’s port. She has received numerous death threats and is continually followed.
“It’s a really critical situation, a humanitarian crisis,” she said about the new burst of violence. “There’s collective panic, a generalised sense of insecurity where we can’t feel at ease even in our own neighbourhoods or houses or in public spaces.” Estupiñán talks about the many “invisible borders” between neighbourhoods that make it impossible, or extremely dangerous, for local people to even move around. She feels compelled to keep advocating for change in her impoverished region. “I feel that all the threats are nothing in comparison to the injustice the people of Buenaventura live through,” she said. “If I can’t live in peace in my own territory, I’ll continue to take on risks to at least try to make a change and not just turn a blind eye.” Monica’s voice trembles as she talks of the evening a few weeks ago when a young man was taken from her neighbourhood by an armed group. His whereabouts remain unknown. “People are terrified in their own homes,” said Monica, in her mid-30s, who asked the Guardian to protect her identity. “People are underneath their beds in the evenings because they don’t know what time the shootouts will start.” Protests in recent weeks have seen young people at the forefront. The largest was on 11 February, when 80,000 people formed a human chain to protest for peace.
About 60% of Colombia’s imports and exports pass through Buenaventura and people say they deserve better from the government. Rapper and activist Leonard Rentería, 28, said he is sick of inequality and the lack of opportunities. “The reality of poverty, abandonment and unemployment is that a lot of young people end up joining these groups,” Rentería told the Guardian inside a recording studio built by young people from the neighbourhood. His lyrics touch on the violence people encounter on a daily basis in his city. But his attitude has come at a price. He has had numerous death threats and, like most others who speak out, has to be accompanied by a security team.
“Rap has been a form of protest for me … a way to publicly show the reality here, but it’s also a way for me to express all the anger I feel for everything that goes on here,” he said. Local politicians and citizens are calling on President Iván Duque to come to Buenaventura to support the protests. On the campaign trail in 2018, Duque proclaimed himself “an adopted child” of the city and promised to make the port one of his top priorities. He has yet to return. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said security forces focus “almost exclusively on targeting commanders of armed groups”, but do not take enough steps to dismantle groups, or attack their financing. “The situation in Buenaventura is a clear example of the failings of the security strategy of the Colombian government,” said Juan Pappier, senior Americas researcher at HRW. “The government seems to believe that killing or arresting a commander will automatically bring protection. But the recent experience shows they are wrong. Oftentimes, the commanders are quickly replaced. Other times, such as in recent months, the arrests result in divisions within the armed groups and bring fighting among factions and more suffering for the people.”
The Puente Nayero humanitarian space in the La Playita neighbourhood is an impoverished area of about 500 families, atop a former landfill. Raw sewage runs beneath wooden houses on stilts. This neighbourhood used to be the site of the most terrifying legacy of the city, the chop houses, where armed groups would torture and dismember their victims. Some of those we interviewed say chop houses still operate in other parts of the city, just not as openly as before, and limbs are left in the streets as a warning. The streets here have been patrolled by the military since 2014, to rid the neighbourhood of gangs and let residents live in peace. It has been a success. Nayibe Valencia Angulo, 36, is the wife of a teacher who was “disappeared” in 2018 from their village on the Naya River by armed groups. After receiving threats, she left with her family and now lives in the protected humanitarian space. “The violence has been relentless [in the past weeks]. It’s shocking what people are living through in Buenaventura. The saddest thing of all is that many families have had to leave their homes,” she said, adding that people can cope with Covid but not “this pandemic of violence”.
“The government is to blame. There are so many young people here without work or employment opportunities,” she said, holding a laminated A4 print of a photograph of her husband. Many people in Buenaventura – despite the government’s inaction – still hope for a better future. “It has to change. We can’t keep living like this,” said Monica, thumping her hand on the table. “There are more good people than bad ones, and we need to make this land better for our children … to live in peace, which is the most basic thing, for goodness sake!”"
2021-02-23T07:15:22Z,global-development,Global development,"Reporting on WTO's first female head 'sexist and racist', say African UN leaders","Senior African leaders at the UN have criticised the “sexist and racist” language used in coverage of the appointment of Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as the new president of the World Trade Organization. Okonjo-Iweala, a graduate of Harvard University, was confirmed as the new head of the WTO last week, making her the first woman and the first African to lead the organisation. But members of the UN senior African group (Unsag) – including Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, head of UN Women, Winnie Byanyima, who leads UNAids, and Vera Songwe, the executive secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa – said in a letter that the language used in some media to describe her appointment was “offensive, sexist and racist in a world where both public and private sector leadership is dominated by ageing Caucasian men, who are revered for the experience and skills they bring and have never been characterised by their lineage and offspring”.
Mlambo-Ngcuka, co-chair of Unsag, told the Guardian: “There is a lot of prejudice against women in leadership that is just refusing to go away. We see it when it comes to female politicians or at grassroots level.” One headline in the Swiss daily newspaper Luzerner Zeitung originally read: “This grandmother will become the boss of the WTO.” The headline was later changed. “When men ascend [to power] at a later age, we celebrate their experience and accomplishments,” said Mlambo-Ngcuka. “No one talks about them as a grandfathers, it’s not a relevant talking point.” She said UN Women was pushing hard to address the harassment female leaders face, “which in some cases discourages women from coming up and taking on leadership positions because they don’t need this nonsense. “We really need to talk about this so next time we have a similar situation, newspapers think twice before they write anything like that.” Her comments came as UN Women gears up for two major international meetings this year to advance gender equality, including women’s role in politics. Mlambo-Ngcuka said the Generation Equality forums, which will be held next month in Mexico and in France in June, will bring together government leaders, civil society, young people and the private sector to agree a costed set of proposals to achieve gender justice in policy areas – including equal pay, violence, healthcare and decision-making. The forums were postponed last year because of the pandemic.
Mlambo-Ngcuka said women have been shouldering the responsibility alone for too long and called on men to stop being bystanders and join the fight for equality. Men’s failure to act “enables violence and violations to thrive”, she said. “They are not taking the steps to join the side of women, and we are saying being bystanders really is not an option. “As [Nelson] Mandela said, when good men do nothing, that is a conspiracy against women,” added the former South African deputy president. She said the pandemic had brought a “willingness to listen to the issues that we have been raising so many times, on so many different platforms”, but the devastation it has wreaked on women’s lives, particularly economically, was not reflected in the stimulus packages being discussed. “We need the international financial institutions and the national institutions to talk about this and what they are doing,” she said. “When they are talking about building back better, they must talk about it in a gender responsive and equitable way.”"
2021-02-23T06:00:20Z,global-development,Global development,"Revealed: 6,500 migrant workers have died in Qatar since World Cup awarded","More than 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have died in Qatar since it won the right to host the World Cup 10 years ago, the Guardian can reveal. The findings, compiled from government sources, mean an average of 12 migrant workers from these five south Asian nations have died each week since the night in December 2010 when the streets of Doha were filled with ecstatic crowds celebrating Qatar’s victory. Data from India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka revealed there were 5,927 deaths of migrant workers in the period 2011–2020. Separately, data from Pakistan’s embassy in Qatar reported a further 824 deaths of Pakistani workers, between 2010 and 2020.
The total death toll is significantly higher, as these figures do not include deaths from a number of countries which send large numbers of workers to Qatar, including the Philippines and Kenya. Deaths that occurred in the final months of 2020 are also not included. In the past 10 years, Qatar has embarked on an unprecedented building programme, largely in preparation for the football tournament in 2022. In addition to seven new stadiums, dozens of major projects have been completed or are under way, including a new airport, roads, public transport systems, hotels and a new city, which will host the World Cup final. While death records are not categorised by occupation or place of work, it is likely many workers who have died were employed on these World Cup infrastructure projects, says Nick McGeehan, a director at FairSquare Projects, an advocacy group specialising in labour rights in the Gulf. “A very significant proportion of the migrant workers who have died since 2011 were only in the country because Qatar won the right to host the World Cup,” he said.
There have been 37 deaths among workers directly linked to construction of World Cup stadiums, of which 34 are classified as “non-work related” by the event’s organising committee. Experts have questioned the use of the term because in some cases it has been used to describe deaths which have occurred on the job, including a number of workers who have collapsed and died on stadium construction sites. The findings expose Qatar’s failure to protect its 2 million-strong migrant workforce, or even investigate the causes of the apparently high rate of death among the largely young workers.
Behind the statistics lie countless stories of devastated families who have been left without their main breadwinner, struggling to gain compensation and confused about the circumstances of their loved one’s death. Ghal Singh Rai from Nepal paid nearly £1,000 in recruitment fees for his job as a cleaner in a camp for workers building the Education City World Cup stadium. Within a week of arriving, he killed himself. Another worker, Mohammad Shahid Miah, from Bangladesh, was electrocuted in his worker accommodation after water came into contact with exposed electricity cables. In India, the family of Madhu Bollapally have never understood how the healthy 43-year old died of “natural causes” while working in Qatar. His body was found lying on his dorm room floor.
Qatar’s grim death toll is revealed in long spreadsheets of official data listing the causes of death: multiple blunt injuries due to a fall from height; asphyxia due to hanging; undetermined cause of death due to decomposition. But among the causes, the most common by far is so-called “natural deaths”, often attributed to acute heart or respiratory failure. Based on the data obtained by the Guardian, 69% of deaths among Indian, Nepali and Bangladeshi workers are categorised as natural. Among Indians alone, the figure is 80%. The Guardian has previously reported that such classifications, which are usually made without an autopsy, often fail to provide a legitimate medical explanation for the underlying cause of these deaths. In 2019 it found that Qatar’s intense summer heat is likely to be a significant factor in many worker deaths. The Guardian’s findings were supported by research commissioned by the UN’s International Labour Organization which revealed that for at least four months of the year workers faced significant heat stress when working outside.
A report from Qatar government’s own lawyers in 2014 recommended that it commission a study into the deaths of migrant workers from cardiac arrest, and amend the law to “allow for autopsies … in all cases of unexpected or sudden death”. The government has done neither. Qatar continues to “drag its feet on this critical and urgent issue in apparent disregard for workers’ lives”, said Hiba Zayadin, Gulf researcher for Human Rights Watch. “We have called on Qatar to amend its law on autopsies to require forensic investigations into all sudden or unexplained deaths, and pass legislation to require that all death certificates include reference to a medically meaningful cause of death,” she said.
The Qatar government says that the number of deaths – which it does not dispute – is proportionate to the size of the migrant workforce and that the figures include white-collar workers who have died naturally after living in Qatar for many years. “The mortality rate among these communities is within the expected range for the size and demographics of the population. However, every lost life is a tragedy, and no effort is spared in trying to prevent every death in our country,” the Qatari government said in a statement by a spokesperson. The official added that all citizens and foreign nationals have access to free first-class healthcare, and that there has been a steady decline in the mortality rate among “guest workers” over the past decade due to health and safety reforms to the labour system.
Other significant causes of deaths among Indians, Nepalis and Bangladeshis are road accidents (12%), workplace accidents (7%) and suicide (7%). Covid-related deaths, which have remained extremely low in Qatar, have not significantly affected the figures, with just over 250 fatalities among all nationalities.
The Guardian’s research has also highlighted the lack of transparency, rigour and detail in recording deaths in Qatar. Embassies in Doha and governments in labour-sending countries are reluctant to share the data, possibly for political reasons. Where statistics have been provided, there are inconsistencies between the figures held by different government agencies, and there is no standard format for recording the causes of death. One south-Asian embassy said they could not share data on the causes of death because they were only recorded by hand in a notebook. “There is a real lack of clarity and transparency surrounding these deaths,” said May Romanos, Gulf researcher for Amnesty International. “There is a need for Qatar to strengthen its occupational health and safety standards.” The committee organising the World Cup in Qatar, when asked about the deaths on stadium projects, said: “We deeply regret all of these tragedies and investigated each incident to ensure lessons were learned. We have always maintained transparency around this issue and dispute inaccurate claims around the number of workers who have died on our projects.” In a statement, a spokesperson for Fifa, football’s world governing body, said it is fully committed to protecting the rights of workers on Fifa projects. “With the very stringent health and safety measures on site … the frequency of accidents on Fifa World Cup construction sites has been low when compared to other major construction projects around the world,” they said, without providing evidence. • The heading and sub-heading on this article were amended on 2 March 2021 to clarify that the figure for 6,500 deaths covers the 10-year period since Qatar was awarded the Word Cup."
2021-02-22T12:12:39Z,global-development,Global development,Rights and freedom – welcome to our series,"A year on from the start of the world’s biggest health crisis, we now face a human rights pandemic. Covid-19 has exposed the inequalities and fragilities of health and political systems and allowed authoritarian regimes to impose drastic curbs on rights and freedoms, using the virus as a pretext for restricting free speech and stifling dissent. There has been a global crackdown on opposition activists and human rights defenders, attacks on journalists, and a roll out of invasive tracking apps and extreme surveillance measures that are likely to far outlast the virus. Over the coming years, the economic fallout of the pandemic will hit millions. Those already facing stigma and marginalisation will suffer the most: women, girls, refugees and asylum seekers, people with disabilities, ethnic minorities and indigenous communities. Human rights crises in countries including Myanmar, Syria, Venezuela and South Sudan threaten lives, health and freedoms. Yet the pandemic has also seen a growing global momentum of resistance, a fight back to protect hard-won rights. Journalism has always been a crucial tool in holding those in power to account and highlighting the drivers and systems that violate the fundamental rights of every human being, as enshrined in law. At this critical moment, there is an urgent need to focus attention on those who are suffering and what can be done to help them. Rights and Freedom is a new Guardian reporting series to investigate and expose human rights abuses, and elevate the voices of people working on the frontline, fighting back for themselves and their communities."
2021-02-22T07:00:23Z,global-development,Global development,"'A pandemic of abuses': human rights under attack during Covid, says UN head","The world is facing a “pandemic of human rights abuses”, the UN secretary general António Guterres has said. Authoritarian regimes had imposed drastic curbs on rights and freedoms and had used the virus as a pretext to restrict free speech and stifle dissent. Writing exclusively in the Guardian, Guterres said the Covid-19 pandemic had rolled back years of progress on human rights, and that abuses had “thrived because poverty, discrimination, the destruction of our natural environment and other human rights failures have created enormous fragilities in our societies”. There has been a global crackdown on opposition activists and human rights defenders, increased attacks on journalists and moves to curb free speech, censor the media, roll out invasive tracking apps and put in place extreme surveillance measures, many of which are likely to far outlast the virus.
A recent report by Human Rights Watch found that at least 83 countries had used Covid-19 as a justification to attack free speech.
China has been accused of particularly egregious breaches, including online censorship, invasive surveillance and the arrest of coronavirus whistleblowers. “The Chinese regime has threatened, arrested, jailed and silenced whistleblowers and citizen journalists who tried to warn of or report on the pandemic. There are grave concerns that the surveillance technology it has rolled out as part of the effort to combat the coronavirus could be used to further stifle dissent and violate human rights,” said Benedict Rogers, chief executive of Hong Kong Watch.
Around the world, governments are failing to guarantee basic rights to health, education and equality, hitting the poorest, most marginalised and minorities the hardest. Guterres said that the failure to ensure equity in vaccination efforts was “the latest moral outrage” to come out of the pandemic. More than three-quarters of 128m vaccine jabs given so far have been administered in only 10 countries, according to the World Health Organization. Not a single dose has been administered in 130 countries, with combined populations of 2.5 billion.
While deaths tolls appear to be significantly higher in western states, the economic impact of Covid has been felt most acutely in the developing world. After years of progress on eradicating poverty, last year the pandemic pushed up to 124 million more people below the poverty line, defined as living on less than $1.90 (£1.36) a day, according to the World Bank. The impact on education has also been “catastrophic”, with school closures affecting around 1.6 billion children, says the UN. Girls in particular are likely to drop out, leaving them vulnerable to child marriage, early pregnancy and domestic violence.
Progress on gender equality has been set back decades. “Violence against women and girls in all forms has skyrocketed, from online abuse to domestic violence, trafficking, sexual exploitation and child marriage,” said Guterres.
The pandemic has shone a harsh spotlight, too, on the dire working conditions of millions of low-wage workers. Massive orders for PPE have been produced by North Korean women toiling in secret factories in China, in conditions that amount to slave labour. Garment makers in Bangladesh have been left struggling to survive as orders from western clothing giants suddenly dried up. And in the Gulf, one of the world’s wealthiest regions, migrant workers have been victims of racial discrimination, arbitrary detention in appalling conditions and wage theft on a huge scale. On top of the slew of pushbacks and attacks on human rights resulting from the pandemic, crises such as the conflict in Yemen, spiralling violence in Afghanistan, the military takeover in Myanmar and an escalating humanitarian crisis in Venezuela threaten the lives of millions across the world. “From Syria to Myanmar, South Sudan or Yemen, or the situation facing the Uighur population in China, the pandemic has added another layer to existing and unfolding human rights crises around the world,” said Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International UK. “There has been a failure of national governments and the United Nations in taking decisive action to address these big global issues and the UN security council veto must not continue to be used to block action on genocide or human rights abuses.”
In a speech to open the 46th regular session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva today, Guterres also said that racist, extremist movements are engaging in a “feeding frenzy of hate” and represent “the number one internal security threat” for some countries. He said global coordinated action was needed to defeat the grave and growing danger of racism.
“The danger of these hate-driven movements is growing by the day. Let us call them what they are: white supremacy and neo-Nazi movements are more than domestic terror threats. They are becoming a transnational threat,” he said. “These and other groups have exploited the pandemic to boost their ranks through social polarisation and political and cultural manipulation.” The UN secretary general also said that gender inequality was the world’s biggest human rights scourge. “The crisis has a woman’s face,” he said. “Violence against women and girls in all forms has skyrocketed, from online abuse to domestic violence, trafficking, sexual exploitation and child marriage.” But amid the despair, there are some reasons for hope. “A real battle” had emerged in defence of human rights, according to Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch. “The pandemic has posed enormous and dangerous challenges and has left millions of people less secure and more vulnerable than they were a year ago, but it has also spotlighted many of the inequalities that we can now focus on.” Guterres called for a response based on solidarity and cooperation. “With the pandemic shining a spotlight on human rights, recovery provides an opportunity to generate momentum for transformation,” he said. “The virus threatens everyone. Human rights uplift everyone.”"
2021-02-22T06:00:23Z,global-development,Global development,The world faces a pandemic of human rights abuses in the wake of Covid-19 | António Guterres,"From the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic almost one year ago, it was clear that our world faced far more than a public health emergency. The biggest international crisis in generations quickly morphed into an economic and social crisis. One year on, another stark fact is tragically evident: our world is facing a pandemic of human rights abuses. Covid-19 has deepened preexisting divides, vulnerabilities and inequalities, and opened up new fractures, including faultlines in human rights. The pandemic has revealed the interconnectedness of our human family – and of the full spectrum of human rights: civil, cultural, economic, political and social. When any one of these rights is under attack, others are at risk. The virus has thrived because poverty, discrimination, the destruction of our natural environment and other human rights failures have created enormous fragilities in our societies. The lives of hundreds of millions of families have been turned upside down – with lost jobs, crushing debt and steep falls in income. Frontline workers, people with disabilities, older people, women, girls and minorities have been especially hard hit. In a matter of months, progress on gender equality has been set back decades. Most essential frontline workers are women, and in many countries are often from racially and ethnically marginalised groups. Most of the increased burden of care in the home is taken on by women. Violence against women and girls in all forms has rocketed, from online abuse to domestic violence, trafficking, sexual exploitation and child marriage.
Extreme poverty is rising for the first time in decades. Young people are struggling, out of school and often with limited access to technology. The latest moral outrage is the failure to ensure equity in vaccination efforts. Just 10 countries have administered more than 75% of all Covid-19 vaccines. Meanwhile, more than 130 countries have not received a single dose. If the virus is allowed to spread like wildfire in parts of the global south, it will mutate again and again. New variants could become more transmissible, more deadly and potentially threaten the effectiveness of current vaccines and diagnostics. This could prolong the pandemic significantly, enabling the virus to come back to plague the global north – and delay the world’s economic recovery. The virus is also infecting political and civil rights, and further shrinking civic space. Using the pandemic as a pretext, authorities in some countries have deployed heavy-handed security responses and emergency measures to crush dissent, criminalise basic freedoms, silence independent reporting and restrict the activities of nongovernmental organisations. Human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers, political activists – even medical professionals – have been detained, prosecuted and subjected to intimidation and surveillance for criticising government responses to the pandemic. Pandemic-related restrictions have been used to subvert electoral processes and weaken opposition voices. At times, access to life-saving Covid-19 information has been concealed while deadly misinformation has been amplified – even by those in power.
Extremists – including white supremacists and neo-Nazis – have exploited the pandemic to boost their ranks through social polarisation and political and cultural manipulation. The pandemic has also made peace efforts more difficult, constraining the ability to conduct negotiations, exacerbating humanitarian needs and undermining progress on other conflict-related human rights challenges.
Covid-19 has reinforced two fundamental truths about human rights. First, human rights violations harm us all. Second, human rights are universal and protect us all. An effective response to the pandemic must be based on solidarity and cooperation. Divisive approaches, authoritarianism and nationalism make no sense against a global threat. With the pandemic shining a spotlight on human rights, recovery provides an opportunity to generate momentum for transformation. To succeed, our approaches must have a human rights lens. The sustainable development goals – which are underpinned by human rights – provide the framework for more inclusive and sustainable economies and societies, including the imperative of healthcare for everyone. The recovery must also respect the rights of future generations, enhancing climate action to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and protecting biodiversity. My Call to Action for Human Rights spells out the central role of human rights in crisis response, gender equality, public participation, climate justice and sustainable development. This is not a time to neglect human rights; it is a time when, more than ever, human rights are needed to navigate this crisis in a way that will allow us to zero in on achieving inclusive and sustainable development and lasting peace. We are all in this together. The virus threatens everyone. Human rights uplift everyone. By respecting human rights in this time of crisis, we will build more effective and equitable solutions for the emergency of today and the recovery for tomorrow. I am convinced it is possible – if we are determined and work together. António Guterres is secretary general of the United Nations"
2021-02-19T11:36:28Z,global-development,Global development,South Africa leads backlash against big pharma over Covid vaccine access,"The domination of global medicine by major pharmaceutical companies needs to be confronted to provide fairer access to vaccines, a leading South African official has said. The scramble over Covid vaccines should alert rich countries to the power of profit-driven companies that control production of crucial medicines, said Mustaqeem De Gama, South Africa’s delegate at the World Trade Organization (WTO) on intellectual property rights. “While Rome is burning, we are fiddling around [waiting],” said De Gama, who called on nations where many of these pharmaceutical firms are based to stop blocking a patent waiver proposed at the WTO. Backed by dozens of developing countries, the proposal, introduced by South Africa and India, argued that bypassing intellectual property rights would allow more of the world’s population to be quickly vaccinated by boosting production. “The first effective vaccines were ready four or five months ago. Do you think it would have made a difference if we had the capacity to manufacture? I certainly think so.” Supplies are low after rich countries bought more vaccines than they needed to, leading to predictions that many low-income countries may not be able to reach mass immunisation until 2024. Some vaccines are being provided to low- and middle-income countries through donations, largely through the Covax initiative led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance – a public-private global health partnership. But many argue the donations are too few and rely on stock unused by rich countries. De Gama said more structural change was needed to enable countries to make their own vaccines instead of relying on terms set by donors or profit-driven companies. “The infrastructure right now is providing a minimum and leaving the rest to the private sector,” said De Gama. “I don’t think governments should be outsourcing their responsibility for public health to private companies who are responsible to shareholders only.” He said the recent sale of AstraZeneca vaccines to South Africa at double the price paid by European countries was evidence of the need for more transparency in how decisions on supplies and pricing are made. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) on Thursday called for urgent delivery of vaccines to lower-income countries in order to avoid further mutations of the coronavirus, such as the 501Y.V2 variant that has spread throughout southern Africa since being identified in December. Prominent South African businesswoman Yamkela Makupula said many were angered at not being able to access vaccines while hospitals and the economy were suffering, hit by the wave of Covid-19 linked to the new variant.
“Most countries across the world are facing recession while having to deal with the effects of the pandemic. So to only vaccinate a portion of the world and leave the rest to fend for themselves with limited resources is a very flawed strategy,” she said. “There is no amount of economic recovery strategies that can save South Africa where it is right now. What is imperative is to get our people vaccinated in order to not only rebuild the economy but to save people’s lives.” Shehnaaz Peer, a GP in Eastern Cape province, said the vaccine “really translates into hope” after seeing a rise in cases, more patients with prolonged Covid symptoms and increasing mental health challenges, especially among young people. Roz Scourse, a policy adviser for MSF Access, said the EU had been “hypocritical” in its recent outrage over undelivered AstraZeneca vaccines while blocking the proposed patent waiver, alongside other countries that host big pharmaceutical companies, including the UK. “This is really showing the EU and other rich countries what happens when you hand over all the rights and control of the manufacture and distribution of Covid vaccines in the time of a pandemic to huge multinational corporations,” said Scourse.
Zain Rizvi, who works on access to medicine at US-based advocacy group Public Citizen, said governments should have demanded more open access from pharmaceutical companies because much of the funding for the initial research and development came from public funding. “Rich countries had tremendous leverage when they were giving funding to these organisations,” he said. “I can’t emphasise enough how outrageous it is that there are vaccine shortages when there is capacity just sitting there. It’s morally bankrupt.”"
2021-02-19T11:00:01Z,global-development,Global development,"Colombia tribunal reveals at least 6,402 people were killed by army to boost body count","A special peace tribunal in Colombia has found that at least 6,402 people were murdered by the country’s army and falsely declared combat kills in order to boost statistics in the civil war with leftist rebel groups. That number is nearly three times higher than the figure previously admitted by the attorney general’s office. The killings, referred to in Colombia as the “false positives scandal”, took place between 2002 and 2008, when the government was waging war against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (or Farc), a leftist guerrilla insurgency, which ultimately made peace with the government in 2016. Soldiers were rewarded for the manipulated kill statistics with perks, including time off and promotions.
Included in the 2016 deal was the creation of a special peace tribunal – known by its Spanish initials, JEP – to investigate and try crimes committed by all sides in the conflict. On Thursday, the JEP made public the preliminary results of its investigation into the “false positives” scandal, following the exhumation of mass graves across the country over the past two years. A statement by the JEP confirmed that the investigation will continue, and will now focus on provinces in the country not yet prioritized in its probe. Jackeline Castaño, whose brother was abducted and murdered by the military in 2008, felt that justice was closer to being served following Thursday’s announcement. While many rank-and-file soldiers have been sent to prison and dozens of senior officers have been fired, victims say that those who gave the orders still have not faced justice. “We are grateful for the publication of the findings of the JEP’s investigations which show how widespread extrajudicial executions were during the period of [then-president] Álvaro Uribe, from 2002 to 2008,” said Castaño, who leads a victims’ group. “We hope that the truth will continue to come out.” Movice, a collective of victims of crimes committed by the Colombian state, also welcomed the JEP’s findings. “The high figure of these crimes is not a surprise,” read a statement by the group, adding that it demonstrates “an internal policy” within the military “without any form of control or sanctions for those responsible”."
2021-02-19T07:15:00Z,global-development,Global development,The number of people in need is frightening – we need a global response | Axel van Trotsenburg,"The numbers are well-publicised but bear repeating. Around 120 million more people were pushed into extreme poverty in 2020, a number that could rise to 150 million in 2021. An estimated 250 million jobs have been lost around the world, and the number of people affected by acute food insecurity was estimated to have doubled to 272 million by the end of last year. A decade of progress in the most fragile countries wiped out. Let’s put a human dimension on these numbers. More than a billion children have been out of school during the Covid-19 pandemic, and girls are much less likely to return to the classroom. These kids are not only missing out on learning; they will be less likely to find jobs and fulfil their potential. People who have lost their main source of income are struggling to feed their immediate households and are unable to send much-needed remittances to their families in rural areas. To halt the destruction of lives and livelihoods, the international community must act swiftly to accelerate support for countries to enable them to sustainably recover and secure a better future for their people.
As an immediate priority, we need to ensure that low-income countries have full access to vaccines now being rolled out in advanced economies. The risk is real that these countries will not be able to get the supplies they need to protect their people. The international community needs to ensure that equitable and fair access to vaccines is not only rhetoric but a reality. Second, substantial resources must be committed to low- and middle-income countries. In the past six months, many nations have put in place measures to mitigate social and economic impacts of the pandemic. Industrialised countries have spent up to 20% of their GDP on stimulus packages. But for the poorest countries, that figure is less than 2%. It is crucial for countries to invest in their recovery, but if a broader approach is not taken, we risk widening the gap between rich and poor countries even further. The World Bank has been increasing availability of resources from the International Development Association, our fund for the poorest countries, and is on track to commit up to $55bn (£40bn) to the poorest countries over the period of April 2020–June 2021. But debt relief is needed to free resources so governments can combat the virus while keeping other critical services operating. The G20’s debt relief initiative has helped. What is needed now is more private-sector participation. Pandemics, widespread recessions and the climate crisis do not respect national borders. Response must be global.
Critical transitions are necessary in our energy systems, food systems, and transport and urban systems. We must build resilience across all facets of the economy, promoting greener growth and strengthening human capital through better services for health, education, housing, water and social protection. We must also prioritise guarding against future crises – not just tackling climate impacts, which are at the front of many people’s minds today, but also through macroeconomic stability, social systems and infrastructure. Deepening inequalities mean we must urgently target interventions to the most disadvantaged, particularly women, girls and children with disabilities. Social protection systems need to be inclusive, supporting vulnerable households while preventing non-poor households from falling into poverty. Strong and sustained international cooperation is essential. The longer we delay, the deeper the damage will be, not just in developing countries but everywhere. The response of the international community to the crisis is under intense scrutiny, as it should be. A “business as usual” approach will not deliver. Without resilient foundations, countries will be trapped in costly cycles of setback and recovery. The World Bank will continue to work with international institutions and country authorities to help coordinate the world’s response. By working together, we can rise to the challenge of a green, resilient and inclusive global recovery for all. Axel van Trotsenburg is managing director of operations at the World Bank"
2021-02-19T06:28:47Z,global-development,Global development,Myanmar protester shot in head during police crackdown dies,"A woman who was shot in the head by police during protests in Myanmar last week has died – the first protest fatality since the military took control in a coup more than two weeks ago. Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing, 20, had been on life support since being taken to hospital on 9 February after she was hit by what doctors said was a live bullet at a protest in the capital, Naypyitaw. “I feel really sad and have nothing to say,” said her brother, Ye Htut Aung, told Reuters. A hospital official confirmed her death at 11am, and said her body would be examined later on Friday because “this is a case of injustice”. “We will keep the [cause of death on] record and send a copy to the respective authorities. We will look for justice and move forward,” said the official.
The shooting of the grocery store worker happened while police were clearing crowds and roused anger across the nation and rallied support for the movement, many of whose members say they refuse to allow another generation to experience military rule. Thousands of protesters gathered again in Yangon on Friday, with police making their biggest effort yet to block protests downtown, sealing off of the main focal points, near Sule Pagoda, after a huge rally at the major intersection the previous day stopped traffic in the area. Protesters gathered on all four sides of the blocked-off area; with some crowds growing to more than 2,000 strong by 11am. Barricades remain outside City Hall, where Buddhists are chanting at the police, and nearby, a protest began outside Myanma Economic Bank. Opposite the bank, three truckloads of Tatmadaw soldiers were parked down a narrow road. “The police are afraid of us,” said a protest organiser draped in a rainbow flag near Sule Pagoda. “They don’t want us to gather and chant, but we will continue peacefully.” Myanmar’s army seized power on 1 February and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, ending a long transition towards democracy and bringing tens of thousands of demonstrators onto the streets. Earlier, Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing’s brother Ye Htut Aung told Reuters the family – though supportive of the protests – had urged her against going to the demonstration for fear of violence. She insisted. “It was her spirit,” he said by phone. “She wanted to and I couldn’t stop her.”
The last time he spoke to her, he said, was on a voice call over a poor connection. Neither could get the video to work – the new ruling junta has been stifling internet access. Ye Htut Aung warned her to stay at the back of the protest and that the police were not to be trusted. “What are you going to do if they shoot?” he asked. “No, they wouldn’t,” she replied. “It’s OK. Even if they fire, it should be fine.” At the time of the shooting, the army’s True News Information Unit said security forces used only non-lethal weapons and that the police were investigating. The shooting prompted protesters to drape a massive a portrait of her from a bridge in downtown Yangon, the commercial capital, with the words: “Lets together oppose the dictator who kills the people.” Video footage posted to Facebook and verified by Reuters shows the moment of the shooting. In the footage, Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing stands at the front of a crowd of protesters facing riot police. Wearing a red T-shirt and helmet, she is first struck by a stream fired by a water cannon. A woman beside her takes her hand and tries to lead her away. While their backs are turned, there is a crack and she crumples to the ground. Police continue to soak the crowd with water cannon as they try to tend to her. Ye Htut Aung said the military had tried to have his sister transferred to an army hospital but the family had refused. The family were all National League for Democracy (NLD) supporters who voted for the party in the November election that it won by a landslide. The military has said, without evidence, that the election was fraudulent, to justify their seizure of power. Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing voted for the first time, her brother said. With Reuters"
2021-02-18T10:00:31Z,global-development,Global development,Brazil health workers accused of giving Covid vaccinations with empty syringes,"Police in Brazil are investigating allegations that healthcare workers are giving fake Covid-19 inoculations, amid reports of nurses injecting people with empty syringes. Cases of what local media are calling “wind vaccination” have been reported in four states, adding to the woes of the country’s halting and uncoordinated immunisation programme.
Police announced a criminal investigation on Wednesday, amid speculation that the nurses were either anti-vaxxer conspiracy theorists, or were pocketing vaccine shots to be sold on the black market. “This initially seemed an isolated case, but, although they are still exceptions, it is very concerning that we are seeing this in several places ,” said Carla Domingues, an epidemiologist who coordinated Brazil’s national immunisation programme between 2011 and 2019. “Either these health professionals were poorly trained or they did it in bad faith. In both cases it is inadmissible,” she added. Rio state police said that if the vaccines had been misappropriated, those involved could be charged with embezzlement, which carries a sentence of up to 12 years in prison. One video recorded by a relative and published in local media shows a nurse injecting an empty syringe in the arm of a 94-year-old woman at a drive-through vaccination site in the city of Petrópolis. After the video went viral, the nurse was dismissed and investigations were launched by the municipality, the regional nursing council, and the local police. “We have to wait for the conclusion of the investigation, but I don’t believe it was intentional,” said Aloísio Barbosa Filho, the secretary of health in Petrópolis. The nurse had over 10 years’ experience in the practice and was trained following immunisation protocols, according to the secretary. “As it was the first days of vaccination, she might have felt some pressure and was more prone to error,” Barbosa Filho said. “It is unacceptable anyway.” The secretary said that it was the only incident reported among more than 7,000 vaccines administered in Petrópolis, which has successfully immunised 2.7% of its population. Brazil once boasted a world-renowned immunisation programme for diseases such as measles, polio, smallpox and tetanus, but it has faced a string of setbacks in the delivery of coronavirus vaccines. “The [current] programme is totally uncoordinated,” Domingues said. “The plan should be organized at the federal level, but the health ministry delegated it to regional authorities.” One month after Brazil kicked off its nationwide immunisation campaign, state capitals including Rio de Janeiro and Salvador had to put vaccinations on hold on Wednesday after imports of the doses were delayed. A group representing mayors from Brazil’s municipalities has asked the health minister, Eduardo Pazuello, to “urgently” resign. “His leadership did not believe in vaccination as a way out of the crisis and did not carry out the necessary planning for the acquisition of vaccines,” the group wrote on Tuesday.
Pazuello, who also faces an inquiry for his handling of an acute shortage of oxygen in the Amazon city of Manaus, did not comment. More than 241,000 Brazilians have died from Covid-19, but the president, Jair Bolsonaro, has repeatedly questioned the efficacy of vaccinations against the disease, dragged negotiations to import doses and essential ingredients, and said he will refuse to be vaccinated. Fraud and misinformation have added to the problems facing local authorities. In recent days thousands of reports have emerged of people jumping the queue to receive vaccinations before priority groups while anti-vaccine disinformation campaigns have also gained traction, reaching even remote indigenous villages in the Amazon."
2021-02-18T07:15:27Z,global-development,Global development,Educating Zimbabwe: illegal ‘home schools’ defy lockdown in townships,"It’s Friday morning and Help Mabwe is preparing to give the day’s illicit lessons. Round the back of his house the teacher has created a classroom out of some old canvas and some wooden poles. A few broken chairs and benches, and an ancient chalkboard complete the furniture in Mabwe’s backyard college in Kuwadzana, a township 15km west of central Harare. Faced with schools being closed indefinitely across Zimbabwe, this garden classroom is the only option for many children and young people in Kuwadzana. Schools in the country were closed in March 2020. Some began to reopen in October for pupils taking exams, but all were then shut indefinitely in January as the cases of Covid began again to rise. The closures led to an almost 10% drop in the number of children passing their national grade seven exams last year. More than 80 schools recorded no passes at all.
“The home schools are the answer to the current dilemma that we find ourselves in,” says Mabwe, as he welcomes students arriving for a sociology lecture. At Mabwe’s home college, students pay $10 (£7.25) a month, while the poorer children, mostly orphans, can study for free, he says. “There are instances where parents cannot afford lessons. We can have a gentleman’s agreement. There are some children who are orphans, so we take about 10 and teach them for free. “This is also part of our corporate social responsibility. We are in the community and want to serve the community. We are not driven by money, but we are driven by the need to better lives.” Some of his students arrive having not eaten. “It is one of the contributing factors to a poor pass rate. I wish I had the resources to feed some of them,” says Mabwe.
Home schools have sprouted up across Harare’s townships, but the government has warned teachers not to open their own classrooms, saying that these are illegal under lockdown rules. The government has banned gatherings of any kind because of the recent rise in case numbers. Since the pandemic began, Zimbabwe has recorded more than 35,000 coronavirus cases and 1,400 deaths. Before Covid, the government was already beginning to crack down on teachers establishing private colleges, or charging fees to hold extra classes outside the normal school day to subsidise low wages. Unregistered private colleges have been subject to frequent raids by the police and council officials. Some officials have demanded bribes to allow them to continue operating, teachers say.
“Despite the setbacks, we are registering good results,” says Mabwe. “We have problems with authorities. The council and educational officials always harass us but at the end of the day we want the children to win. We want education to win. “We are passionate about teaching. There are several teachers, teaching as backyard schools but they are producing good results.” During lockdown, the government wants pupils to learn through online classes and radio lectures, but internet access is considered a luxury and costs are prohibitive for poorer families. “Trying to conduct online lessons does not work,” says Moud Maenzanise, a teacher who has transformed her veranda into a teaching area for five students. “At times, a teacher needs physical contact with a student because [otherwise] you will be producing a half-baked student. “There is a need to assess the physiological capacity of the student and online lessons do not provide for that. We need to build the whole person, but we cannot do that online. Online lessons are for the affluent north, but here in the ghetto parents cannot afford that.” She adds: “We are always making sure that we are improving. We would like the government to give us the recognition, instead of having constant running battles with them. It’s an issue of over over-regulation.” Mernard Mapuke, who has turned his garage into a makeshift classroom, says thousands of children in townships risk dropping out of school.
“Each time I talk to some of these children, I can tell they are no longer interested in school. The only solution is to help them in their homes while we wait to return to school. If not, we are breeding a very dangerous society,” says Mapuke. “There is absolute poverty here … but we want the ghetto child to understand that education will end endemic poverty, which is associated with the ghetto. We always instil in them a culture of believing in themselves. Therefore, we need to conduct these lessons,” he says. But the president of the Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ), Raymond Majongwe, described the schoolteachers setting up home schools as “bad apples” who were exposing children to Covid-19. “The real tragedy is that quality assurance becomes a problem in these schools. But a vacuum has been created by the closure of schools, so people are responding to that. Even bad apples find themselves also teaching,” says Majongwe. “We need proper systems. This is the reason why hospitals cannot just open everywhere, the education system should be like that also. These backyard schools cannot be the solution.” Majongwe urged the government to address teachers’ grievances over pay and conditions to ensure better exam results this year. Teachers in Zimbabwe are paid the equivalent of $50 a month. Last year, they downed tools over pay and a lack of personal protective equipment at schools. Mabwe has vowed to continue running the college in the tent at his home. “These backyard schools are their pupils’ only hope.”"
2021-02-17T13:50:31Z,global-development,Global development,Athens accused of ‘downplaying’ risks of lead contamination at Lesbos camp,"The Greek government is “downplaying” the risks of lead contamination in the refugee camp on Lesbos, according to Human Rights Watch. The group is calling for further comprehensive testing at the Mavrovouni camp after results revealed that one area had particularly high levels of lead contamination. About 21,000 sq m of the former military camp adapted to accommodate refugees in September last year had previously been used as a firing range, raising concerns about the potential for lead exposure. About 7,000 people, including thousands of children, live in the temporary camp, which is now five months old and was built after the nearby Moria camp went up in flames last September. After calls for transparency, Greek authorities released the test results of 12 soil samples taken from the camp, also known as new Kara Tepe, one of which showed 2,233 milligrams of lead a kilogram. The normal limit for residential areas in Greece is 500 milligrams a kilogram.
The authorities have stated that this sample was found in an “administrative” zone for NGO workers and is not in a “residential” area. The government said that it was taking a series of measures to mitigate any contamination, including adding new soil in the affected zone. It has issued assurances that it poses no significant risk. However, in light of the findings, Human Rights Watch says urgent further comprehensive testing of the entire site is essential. The organisation said that camp residents have been seen queueing up in the administrative area to access NGO services and that residents must also be informed about the health risks of lead exposure. The group also noted that since children have been spotted playing across the site, including in the area of the former firing range, it would be more appropriate to measure the findings against the acceptable levels for lead in Greek playgrounds, which is 100 milligrams a kilogram.
Belkis Wille, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch, said that while the Greek government had taken some positive measures, more needed to be done. “The steps of testing and transparency are incredibly important and are moving in the right direction,” she said. “That said, we are deeply concerned that the government is undermining that transparency by misrepresenting what the results show, and they are not warning camp residents and aid workers of the risks that they continue to face in the camp.” Wille also said that the European commission, which has contributed significant funds to the Lesbos camp, should press Greek authorities into further action. “Until further testing takes place, there is no way for anyone living or working in the Mavrovouni camp to know whether they are at risk or not,” she said. “That should be a matter of concern to the European commission as well as Greek authorities.”"
2021-02-17T11:46:59Z,global-development,Global development,'No way they'll back out': tensions rise amid Ethiopia opposition hunger strike,"For two hours the doctors had waited outside the gates of Kaliti prison in Addis Ababa. Bekele Gerba, a leading Ethiopian opposition figure from the Oromo ethnic group, was very ill and due to be taken to hospital for treatment. The 60-year-old is one of 20 senior political detainees, including the most prominent, Jawar Mohammed, who have been on hunger strike for the past three weeks. After a flurry of phone calls, the prison authorities informed the waiting medical team that the prisoner, who has hypertension, would not be going to hospital on Friday. “They wouldn’t let us provide the emergency medical care he needs,” said Dr Illili Jamal, who alleged that the order to keep him in his cell came from senior government officials.
But on Tuesday Bekele was given clearance to be transferred to a private hospital for treatment. However, his family claim he was instead apprehended and “forcibly” taken to an army hospital. Illili, who was with him at the time, was briefly detained. By Tuesday evening Bekele had been returned to his cell without treatment. Bekele and Jawar, of the popular nationalist party, the Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC), are among the high profile figures facing serious charges, including terrorism, over the violent unrest that followed the murder of a popular Oromo musician last June. It was a major flashpoint in Ethiopia’s troubled political transition, which began in 2018 with the appointment of Abiy Ahmed, the prime minister thought to be a reformist, and has descended into civil war in the northern Tigray region, widespread inter-ethnic violence, armed insurgency in parts of Oromia, and, in recent months, intensifying state repression. Abiy’s Prosperity party accuses the detainees of playing a role in inciting violence which led to more than 100 deaths in June and July – many, according to the state-appointed human rights commission, killed by rioting mobs. The ruling party strongly denies that any of the detainees are political prisoners. “There were hundreds of people who have been directly affected by the violence these individuals have instigated and incited,” said Gedion Timothewos Hessebon, the attorney-general, in September. “We have to distinguish between peaceful, lawful political mobilisation and the kind of rhetoric, the kind of ultranationalist, militant, violent political activism that results in death and injury of citizens.”
Others arrested included journalists and influential politicians from across the spectrum, including Eskinder Nega, an opponent of Oromo nationalism with a large support base in Addis Ababa. Detainees say the arrests were politically motivated with an eye on national elections scheduled for June. “Anyone who looks at the charges can very clearly see what the intentions of the government are,” said Ibsa Gemeda, one of the defendants’ lawyers. “Ultimately this is a political trial by the Prosperity party to squash Oromo opposition.” Another lawyer on the defence team was briefly arrested on 1 February, while family members, journalists and activists were later barred from attending a court hearing. “Authorities should immediately facilitate Oromo political detainees’ access to the urgent and specialised medical treatment they may require and stop harassing their family members and supporters,” said Laetitia Bader, Horn of Africa director at Human Rights Watch. The group has said that the detentions and investigations were marred “by serious due process violations”. In August, Jawar is said to have become sick in prison. The government accused him of feigning illness in order to drum up support. Four of the detainees including Jawar and Bekele were subsequently granted permission to receive medical care from their own physicians, after the defence’s complaint that their security could not be assured by government medical staff.
On 27 January the group began their hunger strike, which has been followed by scattered protests in various parts of Oromia calling for their release. At least one protester has been killed. According to their doctors, Jawar and Bekele are beginning to show side-effects including kidney damage. Four of their fellow detainees collapsed last week and were taken to hospital. “Very close supervision is required to prevent any grave threat to their health and life,” said Ethiopian Human Rights Commission head Daniel Bekele on 5 February. “Reasonably justified demands of the prisoners must be addressed.”
Central to the controversy over the detainees’ fate is the considerable reputation of Jawar, whose record as a politician and activist – which includes founding the now-banned Oromia Media Network – sharply divides Ethiopians. To his critics he is a demagogue whose nationalist rhetoric has inflamed inter-ethnic relations. The government’s charges against him – none yet proved – include training a terror group in Egypt, the murder of a police officer and intent to topple the government by force. But for his many supporters he is the figurehead and chief organiser of the Oromo protest movement, which began in late 2014 and later led to the ousting of the previous government, an authoritarian coalition led by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). The TPLF, having been dislodged from the federal government in Addis Ababa, is now at war with Abiy’s administration. “Here is an icon who fought for years for democracy and helped organise the youth to topple the TPLF-led regime – who is now counting days,” a fellow Oromo activist said. “It’s a hugely consequential story which underscores the unravelling and changing fortunes for Jawar and his millions of supporters.” Those shifting fortunes include mass arrests, unlawful killings and the forced closure of opposition parties’ offices across Oromia. It also involves the crippling of the anti-government protest movement known as the Qeerroo.
Numerous demonstrations calling for Jawar’s release have had limited impact – a reflection of support, in places, for Abiy and the ferocity of the security crackdown; and divisions within the Oromo movement. But many fear renewed turmoil should he or his fellow detainees die in prison. “The consequences would be huge,” said Bahar Oumer, a human rights lawyer based in the US. “I wish the government would reconsider its position and at least make some gesture of conciliation to the opposition, for example by freeing jailed leaders.” Before her arrest Illili told the Guardian that the hunger strikers have given no indication they intend to change their tactics. “They are aware of the consequences and they are committed to doing it – they were telling us right up to the last time we saw them that there is no way they will back out. They will go to the last minute.”"
2021-02-17T06:30:12Z,global-development,Global development,Nepal proposes 'ridiculous' ban on women travelling without permission,"A proposed law in Nepal that would ban women from travelling abroad without permission from their families and local government officials has been called unconstitutional and “ridiculous”. The proposals, introduced by the Department of Immigration last week in an attempt to prevent women being trafficked, would require all women under 40 to seek permission before they visit Africa or the Middle East for the first time. Following criticism, the department said the law applied only to “vulnerable” women and stressed it had yet to be finalised. On Friday, hundreds of Nepali women gathered to protest against the proposals at the Maitighar Mandala in the heart of Kathmandu, as part of a “women’s march” to highlight rape and other abuses of female rights. Hima Bista, executive director at Women Lead Nepal, told protesters: “What is extremely dangerous is the thought process behind it. The very fact that a policymaker is thinking about drafting this law restricting the movement of adult girls and women tells us how deep-rooted the patriarchal mindset is.
“A blanket approach targeting girls and women does not work. More homework is required if immigration rules are to be changed, across all genders and within the immigration department itself.” Ila Sharma, a former election commissioner of Nepal, said: “It’s preposterous the way educated bureaucracy seems to be objectifying women. Clearly, they do not see women as fully fledged adults. “Instead of empowering and building the capacity of women, as well as the rest of the emigrant labour workforce, they are being regressive, unconstitutional, not to say ridiculous.” Nepal’s Human Rights Commission estimated that about 35,000 people, including 15,000 women and 5,000 girls, were victims of trafficking in 2018. Activists pointed out that it is not just women who are trafficked, so immigration lawmakers should consider women and men in any proposed legal changes. There have been several attempts over the past decades to combat exploitation through travel restrictions. The latest was in 2017 when the government banned Nepali citizens from working in the Gulf as domestic workers, a move that targeted women. Activists have long complained that banning women from travelling doesn’t work and infringes their rights. Meenakshi Ganguly, south Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said the current proposals could “force women into riskier, undocumented employment, increasing the danger of trafficking and abuse”. Ganguly said the government “should better regulate recruitment agencies, work with destination country governments to put protections in place, and respond effectively to provide protection services when abuses occur”."
2021-02-16T11:54:29Z,global-development,Global development,Malawi sacks heads of Covid-19 taskforce amid audit of use of funds,"Malawi’s president Lazarus Chakwera has fired the heads of his government’s Covid-19 taskforce, in what is being seen as his first decisive move during the pandemic. The president fired the head of the disaster management department and the taskforce’s co-chair, and suspended further officials, some “for failing to maintain proper records of how such critical funds were used and others for defying my directive to submit reports weekly to my office”. He said the pandemic called for “strong leadership”. “The suspensions will pave the way for a full forensic audit, which the national audit office has already begun, and a full and independent investigation, which the director of public prosecutions has requested the Malawi Police Service to conduct as a matter of urgency,” Chakwera said. “Every Covid-19 death is tragic and to be mourned, and, although it is God who ultimately has power over life and death, the deaths that are preventable are even more heartbreaking. We therefore have a moral and civic duty to do everything we can to ensure that no penny meant for saving lives is stolen or abused, or wasted by anybody,” Chakwera, a former pentecostal church pastor, said. When officers appeared before the taskforce with their reports on how they spent 6.2bn kwacha (£5.8m), only one official had properly backed up reports. Pressure had been mounting on the president to prove how the millions set aside for planning and public awareness, facilitating the return of Malawians from South Africa, border patrols and supporting victims of gender-based violence was being spent. The social justice and human rights campaigner Idriss Nassah was among those who called for proof the money was being used for the intended purpose. The revelations that the money might have been abused has caused outrage. Malawi Human Rights Defenders Coalition (MHRDC) released a statement saying it was disappointed at the apparent failure to account for the resources.
The MHRDC said: “Equally shocking is the information that in the north, places such as Songwe, Chitipa and several other borders have never had patrols since July 2020. One wonders: what did the department of disaster do with [the] K580 million it spent on border patrols?.” After a presidential address on Sunday, Nassah posted on his Facebook page: “Thank you, Mr President. Tomorrow, I shall be following up with the office of the president and cabinet, as I did last week, for all of the expenditure reports – in the form they were presented to him by DODMA (Department of Disaster Management) and the clusters – to be made publicly available. Together, we shall follow the money.” Chakwera said the heads of Covid-19 clusters would be required to submit a weekly report of their expenditure, “and I will immediately deal with any cluster that fails to do this”. “If we are going to root out the problem of waste, abuse and theft of public resources, we must admit that these are behaviours that have poisoned our values as a nation and have corroded our entire government system,” the president said. He announced that 100,000 additional doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine secured through the African Union would arrive in Malawi this week for the protection of health workers."
2021-02-16T10:32:57Z,global-development,Global development,"Stateless, stuck and desperate: the militants' wives trapped in Kashmir","Under dark skies in Kashmir’s heavily militarised town of Kupwara, Saira Javed mournfully recalled her happy childhood. Recounting her early life in Karachi, a bustling metropolis over the border in Pakistan, she spoke vividly of her father, Abdul Latif, who would take their large family on weekend picnics and of the moonlit nights she spent dying her hands with henna. But for over a decade, Javed has only been able to catch glimpses of her Pakistani homeland through infrequent and grainy video calls made on low-speed internet. “We don’t have an existence here, our children have no existence here,” said Javed. She is one of hundreds of Pakistani women trapped in Indian-administered Kashmir, who have lost their identity, rights and freedom. They married Indian Kashmiri militants when, sometimes many years ago, these men crossed over into Pakistan for training. While there are no official statistics on how many are stuck in Pakistan, it is thought to be around 400. Kashmir has been a source of dispute between India and Pakistan since partition. In the early 1990s, a militant anti-Indian insurgency erupted in Indian-controlled Kashmir and thousands of young Kashmiri men began travelling illegally over the border to Pakistan to receive training and arms. Some ended up staying for years, often getting married. But when these men eventually crossed back over to Kashmir with their new families, their Pakistani wives became stuck and stateless, with no legal rights rights in India but also ineligible for documents to go back to Pakistan. Some of the women, thinking the journey to Kashmir would be brief, left their children behind in Pakistan and have spent the years since enduring the agony of forced separation. Dozens were later divorced by their Indian husbands, leaving them destitute, alone and yet unable to return home. Speaking at a news conference on Monday, several made a desperate appeal to the Indian authorities, saying they had “lost hope of getting citizenship rights”. One of the wives told reporters at the press conference: “We see the last glimpses of our dead relatives on the phone. We see their funerals on video calls. What can be a bigger tyranny than this? Imagine the plight of one’s daughter or sister if she can’t visit her home for nine to ten years, or you can’t see her dead body.” Javed married Javed Ahmad in 2001, a Kashmiri who had crossed over into Pakistan for militant training in 1990. As the Indian military strengthened its presence along the border, Ahmad was among thousands of militants unable to cross back over into India. The long wait made him disillusioned with militancy, and instead he settled into life in Pakistan, working in real estate, getting married and starting a family with Javed. But in 2007, at the insistence of Ahmad, Javed and her two daughters accompanied him back to Kashmir. On their arrival, her husband’s family insisted they stay for good and tore up their Pakistani passports. “We fight every day to go back,” said Javed. Her father died late last year and she had to endure it alone. “What could I have done? I cried,” said Javed, who now runs a boutique where she provides work to other Pakistani wives.
“It has been a struggle. We hold protests and wait for any reply. I have cried so much now that even my tears have now dried and I am not able to cry anymore. Fourteen years is too long to wait,” she said, adding that she does not want her children to have a similar life of suffering and disconnection. Most of the former militants travelled over the border with their wives around 2010, when the Kashmir government, encouraged by warming relations between India and Pakistan, announced a rehabilitation policy for former militants stranded in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. However, the policy was never properly implemented which meant most of the 400 or so former rebels, and around 800 of their family members, had to enter India through informal or illegal routes. The majority flew to Nepal and then travelled to Kashmir by road, meaning their presence was never officially recognised. Life proved tough, with many facing unemployment, property disputes with relatives and acceptance issues that forced them to live in poor conditions, with no access to state support. The wives – seen as outsiders and never given proper citizenship – all spoke of an overwhelming yearning to go back. At least one woman killed herself; another is suffering from severe mental illness. Others are struggling to make sense of their lives and a society that has ostracised them.
Ishrat Bano was a teenager when she married her husband, Nisar Ahmad, who had crossed into Pakistan in 1990 with two friends to train for the insurgency when he was just 16. Instead, Ahmad stayed in Pakistan for 22 years, abandoning militancy and becoming a tailor, but after his mother died, he was determined to return home. In 2012, he took his wife and their three children on an arduous journey through Nepal, taking three planes and exhausting their savings. But Bano found that “the life here is slavery”. The wives are not technically illegal citizens but instead exist in a citizenship no man’s land, denied the right of political participation and ineligible even for a ration card. Bano admitted concealing her suffering from her family in Pakistan. “We lie to them that we have a very comfortable life, a big house, a car,” she said. “If we get a chance to go, we will never come back.” Dozens took part in a demonstration last October in Srinagar, the main city of Kashmir, and demanded that they be given citizenship and documents to visit Pakistan. A group met Lt Governor Manoj Sinha, the chief administrator of Kashmir region, who “assured them of appropriate redressal of their issues”. However, such assurances have so far come to nothing and the women are now threatening to march en masse to the volatile India-Pakistan border, known as the Line of Control.
Among the protesters was Fozia Begum, 42, who was raised in Muzaffarabad in Pakistani-administered Kashmir along with her five sisters and three brothers, most of whom are now dead; but she could not return home to mourn them. She was 17 when she married Ghulam Hassan Lone, who, like many others, had crossed the border to fight for Kashmir’s freedom but swiftly abandoned the conflict. The family travelled to Indian-administered Kashmir in 2007 but she has regretted it ever since. “There is no peace here,” said Begum. She refused to talk about her memories and life in Muzaffarabad and said it was “too painful to scratch the wounds” adding: “If I talk now, I will not be able to sleep later.” Begum said: “I am here during the day but I am there in my dreams.”"
2021-02-16T07:15:44Z,global-development,Global development,Sudan declares states of emergency after protests over soaring food prices,"Seven regions of Sudan have declared states of emergency following violent protests against food price rises. Curfews have been imposed and schools have been forced to close in 10 cities across Darfur, North Kordofan, West Kordofan and Sennar. Buildings were looted and burned, and food was stolen from markets and shops. The regions are among the poorest in Sudan. The joint military-civilian government believes supporters of the former president, Omar al-Bashir, are behind the protests. The government recently ordered the prosecution of members of Bashir’s party. Millions of people in the country are struggling as the cost of living continues to rise amid economic difficulties. The Sudanese pound dropped against the dollar from 260 pounds (£3.40) in November to 315 pounds last month. The annual rate of inflation increased to 269% in December, up from 254% in November, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics.
The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (Fewsnet) has said food insecurity could reach crisis levels in parts of Kordofan and Darfur in the coming months. The price of bread has soared. The cost of subsidised loaves, which have become scarce, have increased from 2 pounds to 5 pounds, while unsubsidised bread is being sold in some areas of Khartoum for 15 or 20 pounds, and up to 50 pounds in Darfur and Kordofan. In January, the price of 1kg of sugar was 220 pounds, up from 150 pounds in 2020. Sudan is being encouraged by the international community to devalue its currency in order to get loans. Mohamed Babikir, an activist who took part in the protests that led to Bashir’s downfall in 2019, said protests had not stopped since 2019. “People are always protesting here and there, demanding justice for those who have been killed, or demanding better politics by having freedoms and the civilian transmission in governance.” Bashir el-Sadig, a teacher at a girls’ secondary school in the capital of North Kordofan, El-Obeid, which has seen large protests, told the Guardian that more than half of his pupils need help buying food, adding: “Many of them work as cleaners as well, to help themselves and their families. People really are struggling and that’s the mistake of the government in the centre, they didn’t provide enough subsidised food.” Abdulraheem Ahmed, a teacher at a boys’ high school in Er Rahad, a city to the south of El-Obeid, said: “My wife and I are only two, and we used to eat fruit every two months, now we stopped having fruit, because it is too expensive. I also walk to school instead of taking transportation, which costs me about 100 pounds. I think I should buy something to eat instead of wasting that on transportation.”"
2021-02-15T17:43:00Z,global-development,Global development,Guinea officials race to contain Ebola outbreak as death toll rises,"Health officials in Guinea are racing to contain a new outbreak of Ebola that has killed at least four people and raised concerns across west Africa, which previously suffered the worst from the virus. On Monday morning, a fourth victim died in Guinea and four others are being treated in an isolation centre, suffering vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding. At least seven of the people who contracted the virus attended the funeral of a nurse in Goueke, a town near the Liberian border, on 1 February the government said on Sunday. “All measures are being taken to stem this epidemic as soon as possible,” Guinea’s health ministry said, declaring an outbreak of the virus last seen in the region in 2016 – at the end of a traumatic three-year outbreak, which infected more than 28,000 people and caused 11,000 deaths in west Africa. The epidemic spread from Guinea to Liberia, Sierra Leone and other countries in the region, sparking extensive and vital prevention, treatment and surveillance systems in several countries, which health officials said had been immediately alerted to contain the outbreak in Guinea. An intensive test-and-trace campaign has begun in Goueke and neighbouring towns. Vaccinations and treatments that have been developed in recent years were being quickly deployed to Guinea and were on standby in neighbouring Liberia and other west African countries, the World Health Organization said, adding to hope that an outbreak could be contained. “There is real concern and a challenge to maintain and reinforce Guinea’s health systems,” said Georges Ki-Zerbo, the head of the WHO mission in Guinea, “but also there is a lot of reinforcement taking place and regional cooperation. On the ground, there are dozens of respondents already mobilised.” The spectre of an Ebola outbreak emerging as countries battled with Covid-19 was also an acute concern, Ki-Zerbo said, as resources were stretched. In some places the response to the pandemic was also a strength. “The alert and vigilance brought by Covid should also help with Ebola, which is easier to detect,” he said. Yet an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), while the country battles to contain coronavirus cases as conflict intensifies, has caused alarm. Four cases of Ebola have been detected, with efforts to address the outbreak hamstrung by conflict between armed groups. Kate Moger, an regional official at the International Rescue Committee, said the Ebola cases were a disaster for communities in northern DRC. “They have faced decades of violence by armed groups and have now, between Ebola and Covid-19, been faced with disease outbreaks for almost three straight years.” Following the cases in Guinea, health officials in west Africa expressed a mixture of growing concern but also some confidence that a major outbreak could be averted. Significant progress had been achieved in improving the capabilities of health systems in small, low income countries like Guinea in west Africa to deal with virus outbreaks such as Ebola, Lassa fever, yellow fever and most recently Covid-19, Ki-Zerbo said. On Sunday, Liberia, which shares a porous border with Guinea, announced its health systems would be on alert for potential cases. Heounohu Romello Hessou, a doctor and senior official in the country’s Covid-19 response, worked in Liberia during its Ebola outbreak and said measures had rapidly begun since the first cases were announced in Guinea and an intensive test-and-trace system was under way in nearby Liberian border towns. “Right now the entire public health institute, essentially birthed from the Ebola outbreak, are working around the clock, sending fact-finding teams, putting out public health measures in those towns bordering Guinea,” he said. “Ring vaccinations” were being implemented, where vaccines to prevent and treat Ebola, would be administered to all known contacts of those infected, he said, with the capacity for widespread testing available."
2021-02-15T15:02:26Z,global-development,Global development,"'I'm a fighter': WTO's first female, African head ready for battle","Even for an economist, there are lots of very large numbers in the life of Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. As the chair of Gavi, the vaccine alliance, she has overseen the annual immunisation of millions of children. When managing director of the World Bank, she oversaw $81bn (£58bn) worth of operations. In her stints in charge of Nigeria’s finances, she tackled Africa’s most populous country’s $30bn debt. And she has 1.5 million followers on Twitter. There are lots of smaller numbers too: the 20 non-profit organisations that have appointed Okonjo-Iweala to their advisory boards, the major banks and corporations she has advised, the 10 honorary degrees in addition to her own doctorate, 20 or so awards, dozens of major reports authored, and the books. Then there are the multiple lists frequently featuring Okonjo-Iweala, 66: the world’s 100 most powerful women, 100 most influential people in the world, 10 most influential women in Africa, Top 100 or 150 women in the world, and many others.
On Monday, Okonjo-Iweala was added to a new list: that of the director generals of the World Trade Organization (WTO), a position that has never before been occupied by an African person nor by a woman. She will take over the institution, with its budget of $220m and staff of 650, at a critical time. It will be the moment to put all the number-crunching experience she has gained over a 40-year career to use. The global trading system – with the WTO at its heart – is facing a make-or-break moment, say experts. But can Okonjo-Iweala fix it? Okonjo-Iweala was six when Nigeria gained its independence from Britain in 1960. She grew up in a small village in the country’s southern Delta State. Her parents, both distinguished academics, were studying in Europe on scholarships, so she and her six siblings were raised by a grandmother. Life was not easy. By the time she was nine, Okonjo-Iweala had learned to cook, fetch wood and manage many of the household tasks. The civil war pitting the separatist Biafra state against the Nigerian central government disrupted her education and exposed her to further hardship. “I was eating one meal a day and children were dying. So, I learned to live very frugally. I often say I can sleep on a mud floor as well as a feathered bed and be very comfortable. It has made me someone who can do without things in life because of what we went through,” Okonjo-Iweala told Forbes magazine last year. When her three-year-old sister became chronically ill with malaria, it was Okonjo-Iweala who carried her for three miles to the doctor’s surgery, pushing through a crowd of 600 and climbing through a window to get the treatment that saved the child’s life.
At the end of the war, Okonjo-Iweala went to the US to study economics at Harvard and MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), married her childhood sweetheart and, at the age of 25, began working for the World Bank, rising steadily up the institution’s hierarchy, travelling widely, and only leaving when invited to be finance minister of Nigeria in 2003. The appointment plunged Okonjo-Iweala into a no-holds barred battle to force through economic reforms. “When I became finance minister they called me Okonjo-Wahala – or Trouble Woman,” she told the Guardian in 2005. “It means: ‘I give you hell.’ But I don’t care what names they call me. I’m a fighter; I’m very focused on what I’m doing, and relentless in what I want to achieve, almost to a fault. If you get in my way you get kicked.” She tackled Nigeria’s huge debt by convincing sceptical western powers to grant relief. Gordon Brown called her “a brilliant reformer”, though others were less appreciative of the deal she did with creditors. Some commentators point out that many of the promises she made to Nigerians of economic growth and job creation went unfulfilled. “She can be really firm and bold, maybe scary to some people, but at the same time she’s still her[self]. A woman who makes us laugh. She has jokes,” said Ada Osakwe, an economist who worked with Okonjo-Iweala in government. Now that the US elections have removed the opposition of the Trump administration to her appointment, it will be the WTO that she will run. This is a far more exposed and far more influential position than any Okonjo-Iweala has held before.
The Geneva-based organisation has faced bitter criticism from all quarters for decades. It was the primary target of a movement protesting against the more nefarious consequences of the form of capitalism and process of globalisation it promotes, while more recently it has been attacked by the US for failing to tackle the challenge posed by China’s model of state capitalism. Poorer nations in the global south have long protested against the advantages they say it has given the developed world, and their relative lack of influence over decision-making compared with richer states. Agricultural subsidies have been a particular point of contention. The organisation has not sealed a major multilateral trade deal in years, and hopes that it could somehow curtail overfishing or help manage the commercial wild west that is e-commerce have been dashed. The Covid-19 pandemic, with struggling economies and growing protectionism worldwide, poses further challenges. “The WTO needs … a fresh look, a fresh face, an outsider, someone with the capability to implement reforms and to work with members to make sure the WTO comes out of the partial paralysis that it’s in,” Okonjo-Iweala said in an interview with CNN. Osakwe, the economist, said the appointment was a “big deal for Africa and it’s a big deal for the world”. “Having such a remarkably accomplished woman take the helm of an institution that needs some level of a shake-up, given everything that’s happening with trade in the world, the fights between the US and China. She has been in the trenches,” she said. Last week Okonjo-Iweala told her Twitter followers that she was looking forward to “finalising the process of WTO’s DG”. “There is vital work ahead to do together,” she said."
2021-02-15T09:50:04Z,global-development,Global development,Fears over Covid vaccine access in Pakistan as private imports sanctioned,"Pakistan will allow private companies to import coronavirus vaccines and has exempted the vaccines from price caps in a divisive move that health experts fear will create vast inequalities in access. The country has been scrambling to secure vaccine supplies but so far only the Chinese-made Sinopharm treatment is being deployed. This month 500,000 doses were donated to Pakistan. Like many other countries, Pakistan has been relying on the Gavi/World Health Organization Covax vaccine initiative, but has yet to receive any of the 17m doses it is expecting. The cabinet granted permission for unlimited imports of coronavirus vaccines, which could be sold to customers. No price cap was set. Fawad Chaudhry, a federal minister in the cabinet, said if the private sector was not included in the vaccination drive it would be impossible for Pakistan to vaccinate its population of more than 220 million.
“The cabinet has given permission for unlimited imports,” Chaudhry said. “For those that can afford the vaccine, we are allowing the private sector to use this business opportunity. For those people who cannot afford the vaccine, the government will arrange it for them. This will result in an effective vaccination drive.” Responding to concerns about the lack of a price cap, Chaudhry said attempts to “control the market” when the private sector was involved “almost always fails”. Chaudhry said he had advised Pakistan’s drug regulatory authority against a price cap. “Price regulations for private vaccines will hinder private import,” he said. Four vaccines have been granted emergency approval, including Russia’s Sputnik vaccine, the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and two Chinese vaccines. The Sputnik vaccine will be the first to be available for commercial sale, with plans for a shipment to arrive next week to be distributed by a private lab. The vaccine, which requires two doses, will be sold for $10 (£7.20) a jab. The decision not to put a cap on the commercial sale price appeared to divide the government. Faisal Sultan, a special assistant to the prime minister on health, said “the price cap could not be fixed at this time since no reference price is available for this to set a number”. However, he said that “once the vaccine is available, the price cap will be fixed”. A health official working with the ministry of national health services said negotiations were ongoing with different countries about a limit on pricing. “It’s not possible to have vaccine approval in Pakistan for commercial use without strict regulations on price,” he said. Mohammad Iqbal Khan, a professor at Shifa Tameer-e-Millat University, said the introduction of the private sector into Pakistan’s vaccination drive risked making vaccines accessible only to the wealthy and well-connected. “It depends on the government and how they go for the vaccination drive and its execution,” he said. “The government has to be very clear on this matter. It should focus on its large poor population. Due to rising inflation and poverty, around half of Pakistan’s population struggles with basic needs. Health itself is a fundamental right. The government should ensure everyone gets a vaccine.”
Pakistan’s limited vaccination drive has also been hindered by widespread vaccine hesitation. According to government records, only 33,000 healthcare workers have so far been vaccinated. As one of only two countries in the world still grappling with polio, there is a huge amount of anti-vaccine propaganda, particularly in poorer rural areas. A doctor at Lady Reading hospital in Peshawar said that on the first day of the vaccination drive about 300 health workers were supposed to receive a jab but only about a dozen did so. “Many people are refusing vaccinations,” he said. “People here say this is a Chinese vaccine and so it is a fraud and will have impacts on their health.” Khan said authorities must avoid a repeat of their failures over polio. “If the government fails to take it seriously, like polio, it [Covid] can live for ever,” he said. “The government has to plan very carefully.”"
2021-02-15T09:31:02Z,global-development,Global development,'They want division': on patrol with Myanmar's civilian night watch ,"Sitting next to a makeshift barricade of bamboo and recycled metal, Aung Than, 30, a tour operator, says he is ready to die for his street. “A life on this street is worth more than mine,” he says. “I am ready to exchange my life to protect them if it comes to that.” Protests against the 1 February coup have grown in recent days in Myanmar’s biggest city, Yangon. Meanwhile, nights are filled with an eerie silence, punctuated by bursts of clashing pots and pans in support of the detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and the clamour of mobs chasing down lone figures. With police apparently on the side of the coup government, and soldiers deployed on the streets of some cities, residents in parts of Yangon have taken protection into their own hands. Community defence units have sprung up in many areas, carrying makeshift weapons to keep watch overnight as part of a growing peaceful resistance movement against the military. When civilian leaders were arrested two week ago, residents began banging utensils as a symbol of driving away the “evil” of the Myanmar military, which seized power from the democratically elected government and jailed Aung San Suu Kyi on a charge of illegally importing walkie-talkies. As the military tightened its grip, the cacophony would erupt when police entered neighbourhoods around midnight to arrest dissidents.
On Friday last week, after days of escalating demonstrations against the coup, the military ordered the mass pardon of more than 23,000 prisoners. Their release on to the streets has been accompanied by a wave of unverified reports of arson, smashed cars and poisoned water tanks. Fear and rumours are gripping communities across Yangon and the country. On Sunday armoured vehicles rolled into the city and the internet was inexplicably cut for eight hours overnight. Hardware stores reported being busy with purchases of wooden sticks, rods and anything else that could be used as a weapon. Aung Than, who was on his second 8pm-to-4am night watch shift, believes the military is under increasing pressure because public servants have joined strikes against the coup, paralysing government functions and complicating the junta’s attempts to paint its takeover as a lawful intervention.
There are fears the military could try to force civil servants to work by intimidation or worse. “We want to protect government workers and their families in this area that the military may target,” Aung Than said. “The strike is an important part of the civil disobedience movement.” The previous night a resident confronted two strangers who had approached their street. The pair ran away, followed by a 20-strong mob that included teenage girls in Pokémon pyjamas carrying metal poles. Only one resident reported seeing the men, who were never found. In Yangon’s Sanchaung township, one night watch detained four men who said in a video that they had been paid to join a protest and break into homes at night. They did not disclose who had paid. Some of those detained have been photographed with bloody faces or had their eyebrows shaved to brand them as criminals. But residents say they are feeding those they capture, treating them well and releasing them after questioning. “The people who have been caught are being held against their will and have been told to do something against their will,” said Aung Than. “They do not know what is going on, so once they answer our questions, we would send them back to their families.” As the night wears on in Yangon, Aung Than’s mother brings out egg fried rice as six men survey the sky for drones that other residents have reported. A ringtone that sounds like metal clashing triggers a brief panic, and when a light signal from the upper block is interpreted as the military arriving, the men hide in the dark behind parked cars. They are vulnerable to detention for staying out past an 8pm curfew, says an electrician who joined the night watch out of concern for his wife, mother and young child. “The military wants people to be in turmoil and worried so they can control their hold on them,” he says. “But the response has created more coordination and deepened bonds between people. The military wants division but we are not going to jump into the trap they have set.” As they return to the soft drinks and snacks at the barricade, the older men tell their young neighbours of the brutality that followed a nationwide uprising for democracy in 1988. The military ruler at the time, Ne Win, ordered troops to kill demonstrators, they say, adding that the current leader, Min Aung Hlaing, will also be overthrown owing to his neglect of the people. But not everyone is happy with the civilian watch groups. “It’s just these days we get no sleep,” says a taxi driver on his way home. “The pots and pans are banging three times a night.”"
2021-02-15T07:15:04Z,global-development,Global development,'I won't go back': why Libyans are joining the boats leaving their shores,"It was after witnessing too much death that Sherif Targi*, 21, decided to leave Libya for Europe. “I saw killing and massacres because of the conflicts between Tuaregs and the Tebu [ethnic minorities],” he says. Targi is a Tuareg from the desert city of Ubari in Libya’s south-west. Under Muammar Gaddafi, Tuareg people were marginalised – not issued government IDs, and restricted from getting work and public services. Things didn’t improve after the dictator was ousted. In October 2019, Targi left home, travelling more than 600 miles (1,000km) to the coastal city of Zuwara. From there, he and about 200 other people, mainly Syrians, Moroccans and Sudanese, crammed themselves on board an overloaded wooden boat, and set off on a dangerous 18-hour journey.
A decade after Libya’s revolution, an increasing number of people are making the perilous journey out of Libya by boat. At the end of December, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) had registered 386 Libyans arriving in Italy by sea in 2020, almost double the number that arrived in 2019. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees recorded a 52% increase of Libyans arriving in Europe, compared with 2019.
A weak economy further crippled by the coronavirus pandemic is helping to fuel the exodus. “The pandemic has made the economy suffer, and has led to a reduction of oil and gas exports. There is also difficulty for Libyans to cash out their pensions, and there’s a huge rise in unemployment among youth,” says Vincent Cochetel, the UNHCR’s special envoy for the western and central Mediterranean. Border closures and limited movements because of Covid-19 lockdowns have affected people’s ability to earn, he says. “They depended on border trade and smuggling things like cigarettes and fuel to get by.” Cochetel predicts a continued rise in Libyans leaving the country in 2021, unless the economy improves. “Libyans tend to stay in their country, even as displaced persons, or seek help from relatives in Tunisia or in Egypt,” he says. “But the socioeconomic impact of the recent devaluation of the Libyan dinar must be monitored.” Corruption and security fears are also becoming push factors for Libyans.
Mousa Algunaidi, of the Nedaa Organization for Human Rights and Community Development, in Misrata, says corruption inside the various state apparatuses in Libya – divided between two rival governments based in Tripoli and Benghazi – imperils basic services such as electricity supply, and has eroded Libyans’ trust in the state.
He adds: “There are a lot of security fears for Libyans in cities like Tripoli, Sirt and cities of the south like Murzuq. Additionally, there are rapidly rising prices and inflation, with banks and the finance ministry limiting cash withdrawals to between 500 and 1,000 Libyan dinars [£280–£560].” Algunaidi believes there is hope for Libya if all parties stick to the comprehensive peace deal signed by the country’s two warring governments in October. But Libya’s defence minister has already threatened to withdraw from the agreement.
“If there’s a full political agreement and elections and the creation of a new constitution, the peace agreement will benefit us. This would definitely decrease the number of Libyans leaving by sea. It could even stop emigration completely. But if there’s a new conflict like what we saw in 2019, we’ll see the shores full of Libyans,” he says. After hours at sea, an Italian coastguard vessel picked up Targi’s boat and he finally reached Italy. “There was nothing harder than this trip. The boat was old. We were overloaded, at sea for two days. The motor was weak. If the coastguard didn’t find us, we would have died,” he says. After being smuggled into France, Targi took a train to Belgium, where he stowed away on a truck to the UK. He made it across the Channel, and settled in London, where he now studies science at college.
Friends back in Ubari say the city has gone from bad to worse. Targi’s childhood friend, Mahmoud Twareg*, says it remains a place of stifled opportunity, and danger.
“The schools are in bad shape without enough teachers. Hospitals lack enough staff and functioning equipment,” says Twareg. “Security is lacking. There are armed groups and gangs everywhere. “The peace agreement is not improving things at all in Ubari. Nothing has changed. The forces of [warlord general Khalifa] Haftar have even come back.” Targi believes that even if the deal holds elsewhere in Libya, and the country puts war behind it, his life will remain far away from home. “I want to finish my studies. I don’t expect life to improve in Ubari. So I won’t be going back anytime soon.” * Names have been changed Sign up for the Global Dispatch newsletter – a fortnightly roundup of our top stories, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues:

2021-02-14T08:00:36Z,global-development,Global development,‘We cannot hope for anything good’: Myanmar coup sparks despair for Rohingya,"For the Rohingya Muslims of Myanmar, news of the fall of Aung San Suu Kyi after the military coup was bittersweet. After all, no community had felt more betrayed by Myanmar’s civilian leader. When she came to power in 2015, the belief was that she would overturn decades of persecution and finally bring about peace and citizenship, following in the footsteps of her father, Gen Aung San. Instead, under her watch the military carried out their most violent operation against the Rohingya, embarking on a genocidal campaign of rape, pillage and murder in Rakhine state in 2017 and driving almost a million people over the border to Bangladesh as refugees. Standing before the International Courts of Justice in The Hague in the Netherlands in 2019, Aung San Suu Kyi, a former Nobel peace prize winner, defended the military action. The Rohingya in Myanmar were also disenfranchised from all democratic participation under Aung San Suu Kyi. They were denied the right to vote and were left off the national census.
Yet, the news of Aung San Suu Kyi’s downfall was met with fear. Since the coup, the man now in charge of Myanmar, Gen Min Aung Hlaing, is the commander who led the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya in 2017. Before the coup, attempts at repatriation of the Rohingya had gone nowhere, mainly due to concerns over safety. Despite Min Aung Hlaing’s insistence in a speech on Monday that a repatriation process would continue – which many took to be a hollow promise designed to appease the international community – for the more than a million Rohingya refugees living in camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh returning to a Myanmar ruled by their persecutors is simply not an option. “Neither the military nor Aung San Suu Kyi has done anything to restore our rights, alleviate our sufferings and bring those who tortured the Rohingya to justice,” said Hossain Ahammad, a Rohingya who lives in Balukhali refugee camp, Cox’s Bazar, with his wife and three children. “Still, there was a hope that through a democratic process the justice would be meted out to us. Now, after the military takeover, we cannot hope for anything good for our community in our home country.” Every military coup that has taken place in Myanmar over the past half century is painfully stained into the Rohingya community’s memory.
It was Myanmar’s first military coup in 1962, led by Gen Ne Win, that laid the foundation of the religious and cultural persecution of the minority that has persisted for more than five decades. Under Ne Win, the Rohingya were stripped of their citizenship and subjected to human rights abuses under the military’s 1978 “King Dragon Operation” which aimed to expel them from Myanmar. In the takeover of the second military regime, led by Gen Than Shwe, the discriminatory policies against the Rohingya were equally brutal and the military’s “Operation Clean Nation” resulted in the expulsion of a quarter of million Rohingya into Bangladesh in 1991. In the quasi-civilian government led by Thein Sein, now-former general, their plight worsened further. Under his rule, more than 200,000 Rohingya were uprooted from across Rakhine state in 2012 and forced into displacement camps, where they still live today without access to healthcare, education or livelihoods. “Any military regimes or civilian-led governments since Myanmar’s first military coup in 1962 have resulted in the deteriorations for the Rohingya,” said Mohammad Rafique, an activist based in Ireland. He added: “The new military regime of Min Aung Hlaing only brings up painful memories for us. Whenever a new government came to power, Rohingya were provided false hope and promises, which were then shredded into pieces.” The mood in the camps of Cox’s Bazar is now one of anger and frustration. Although multiple attempts to repatriate the Rohingya to Myanmar have failed over the lack of assurances by Aung San Suu Kyi’s civilian government that they would be safe, many of the refugees still believed they would eventually be able to go back.
“We all want to go back to our homeland but we cannot return as long as the military is in power,” said Jafar Alam, a Rohingya refugee who has been living in Cox Bazar’s Kutupalong refugee camp since 2012. “The brutal torture by the military led by Min Aung Hlaing forced the Rohingya to flee Myanmar. The wound of that torture and mayhem is still fresh in the mind. Now that this army general is in supreme power, no Rohingya will feel safe to return to Myanmar.” Following the coup, Bangladesh has stepped up security along its border to prevent a fresh influx of Rohingya refugees. The Bangladeshi government, which has become increasingly frustrated at the millions of refugees living in the country, has repeatedly said that repatriation would happen this year. A meeting between officials from Bangladesh, Myanmar and China said Rohingya would begin to return in June. Bangladesh’s foreign minister, AK Abdul Momen, has been insistent that a change in regime in Myanmar would not impede repatriation. “We made the agreement for repatriation with the government in Myanmar, not with any individual. We will continue to remain engaged with the process of repatriation with the government in Myanmar, despite the regime has changed there,” he said. “We want to continue talks with Myanmar to advance the ongoing process of repatriation,” he added. “Repatriation to Myanmar is the only solution to the Rohingya crisis.”"
2021-02-14T05:00:32Z,global-development,Global development,'We took a huge risk': the Indian firm making more Covid jabs than anyone,"Adar Poonawalla, 40, is the chief executive of the Serum Institute of India (SII), the Pune-based, family-owned vaccine manufacturer that is producing more Covid-19 vaccines by dose than any other in the world. For now it’s the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine rolling off its production lines, but SII has signed contracts with three other developers – Novavax, Codagenix and SpyBiotech – all of which have candidates in the works. Did you ever imagine you would be making vaccines for a global pandemic? Nobody wishes for a pandemic, but we were almost designed for one. We produce a billion and a half vaccine doses each year, for around 170 low- and middle-income countries. It’s true we never imagined the whole world being so dependent on us, but nobody else has our capacity to scale up. What has scaling up involved, practically speaking? We committed ourselves to Covid-19 in March. We took a huge risk, because nobody knew then that any vaccine was going to work. Of the $800m (£579m) we needed, we put in $270m and the rest we raised from the Gates Foundation and various countries. We dedicated about 1,000 employees to the programme and deferred all product launches planned for 2020 for two to three years, so that we could requisition the facilities allocated to them. Then it was a question of equipping those facilities and getting them validated for use, which we did in record time. By August we were manufacturing and stockpiling a vaccine that we predicted, correctly, would be approved around December. The first doses were shipped in January, and we’ve dispatched 30m to date. When will you reach full capacity? Right now our production is around 70m doses a month. By the end of March, when we’ll have a third Covid-19 facility up and running, it will be 100m and it could go higher by the end of the year, if we can optimise our processes. Among others we supply the Covax scheme, whose goal is to distribute Covid-19 vaccines fairly around the world. It aims to send out 2bn doses by the end of 2021. I think realistically that could take 18 months, since if we’re lucky we’ll have produced 400m by the end of the year. If the vaccines need to be adjusted to protect against future emerging variants, how much of a challenge will that be? It would be simple now that the processes are up and running. We grow the virus in living cells, so we would simply change the master clone – the virus with which we infect those cells – and that then propagates through them. It would take us two to three months to start producing the new vaccine at capacity. Some people think the reason that rollout has been slow in many countries is because the developers who hold the patents on the vaccines have licensed too few manufacturers to make them. Do you agree? No. There are enough manufacturers, it just takes time to scale up. And by the way, I have been blown away by the cooperation between the public and private sectors in the last year, in developing these vaccines. What I find really disappointing, what has added a few months to vaccine delivery – not just ours – is the lack of global regulatory harmonisation. Over the last seven months, while I’ve been busy making vaccines, what have the US, UK and European regulators been doing? How hard would it have been to get together with the World Health Organization and agree that if a vaccine is approved in the half-dozen or so major manufacturing countries, it is approved to send anywhere on the planet? Instead we have a patchwork of approvals and I have 70m doses that I can’t ship because they have been purchased but not approved. They have a shelf life of six months; these expire in April. What do you think when you see rich countries squabbling over vaccine supplies? I think manufacturers overpromised and didn’t manage expectations well. I under-promised. I said I’d make 50m doses from day one. If everyone had said, ‘Don’t expect large volumes until May or June,’ I think all this could have been avoided. There are reports that in some countries, rich people are finding ways to get vaccinated before poorer people. Is that happening in India too? It’s the reverse here. SII is legally obliged to supply the Indian government and the government is prioritising the poor, the vulnerable and frontline workers. That means everyone else, unless they are elderly or meet other specific criteria, goes to the back of the queue. Don’t forget that the population of India is so large that 200m Indians qualify as vulnerable. That’s 400 million doses already. Can you explain the situation in India over compensation in case of vaccine injury? In many countries, the government indemnifies the manufacturer for costs related to vaccine injury, but here the manufacturer is responsible. I have no problem paying compensation if an injury turns out to be vaccine-related, but at the moment it is possible for the Indian courts to place an injunction on my vaccine production pending investigation of such a case, whether the injury turns out to be vaccine-related or not. I have petitioned the government saying this should not be possible in a pandemic, because it means one such claim could put a halt to our global rollout. We have already had such a case, in fact, and the health ministry had to step in to prevent us being shut down. Do you think the way vaccines are made will change for ever as a result of Covid-19? Yes. Almost every country now wants to set up local manufacturing so that it never has to scramble for vaccine again. They may not all succeed, but for now it looks as if the political will and the capital is there. A lot of pharmaceutical companies and generic manufacturers have also realised that there’s room for new players in the vaccine field. I predict the landscape will be transformed over the next five years. From startup in 1966 to world’s largest vaccine producer in 2021 is quite a journey. How did it start? The Haffkine Institute, a government institute in Mumbai, used to produce anti-snakebite and -tetanus serums by injecting the venom or bacterium into horses and mules, then pulling their blood a few days later and extracting the antibodies. Mine is a family of farmers and horse breeders and my father, Cyrus, used to sell animals to the institute. Eventually he thought, “Why not cut out the middle man and make the serums – later vaccines – myself?”"

For Nicole, she was “pushed over the edge” when violence by her partner triggered a post-traumatic response to historic abuse by other men. “I was getting flashbacks of abuse ... everything came to a head and I just lost it.” For others, like Cathy, it was the stark belief they were beyond the protection of the law and could see no other way out. Put bluntly, it was a matter of survival. The cases of these female prisoners are among those examined in a report that analyses how the justice system treated women who killed their male abusers. It concludes that both the law and the way it is applied in England and Wales means women are being unfairly convicted. Failures to explore properly the abuse suffered by women who kill mean they could be convicted of murder instead of manslaughter, or the appropriate defences may not be put forward, the study found. Now, lawyers who believe dozens of women could be serving time in prison for unsafe murder convictions are assessing at least 20 cases where there may be grounds for appeal. This comes after Farieissia Martin, convicted of killing Kyle Farrell in 2015, had her murder conviction quashed in December following support from Justice for Women, co-authors of the report. She is now facing a re-trial. Harriet Wistrich, the founder of the Centre for Women’s Justice, said: “Our research investigates why, despite an apparent increase in the understanding of domestic abuse, we still see so many miscarriages of justice with women who are themselves victims, serving life imprisonment for choosing to survive.” New data shows that between April 2008 and March 2018, 108 men were killed by women they had been in a relationship with – either at the time of the killing or some time previously. In comparison, nearly eight times as many women (840) were killed by partners or ex-partners during the same period. Researchers looked at 92 cases where women had killed men over the same decade and found that in 77% of them the woman had experienced violence or abuse from the deceased. “This is likely to be an underestimate as some women will never disclose abuse,” explained Wistrich, who has represented more than 10 women in their appeals against murder convictions. She said: “While hundreds of women subjected to violence and coercive control were killed by their partners, most of the small number of women who killed men were driven to do so after suffering abuse. Many were imprisoned for long periods at great cost to them and their families.” Of the 92 cases, 43% of the women were convicted of murder and 46% of manslaughter – just six were acquitted. Of those convicted of murder, 33% were sentenced to 20 years or more in prison and 35% to 15 years or more. In 71% of cases the defendants had stabbed the deceased. Women are more likely to use a weapon than men who kill their female partners – because they tend to be physically smaller – but use of a weapon results in longer prison sentences. Researchers interviewed 20 women between the ages of 23 and 65 from a variety of backgrounds who were convicted for killing abusive men. They also spoke to 14 lawyers who had represented or prosecuted women in these cases and examined 23 domestic homicide reviews and 17 case files involving women defendants who had applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Women who kill their partner or ex-partner often do so as a last resort, researchers found. They noted a failure to address men’s violence throughout the justice system, from policing and legal representation to the courts and prison service. The women in 19 of the 23 domestic homicide review cases had experienced historic abuse from a man other than the one they killed. Nicole said her ex-husband had abused her children and revealed she had also been abused as a child. “He admitted it and got a caution...It had a really big impact on me because I never wanted what happened to me as a child happening to my sonsand it did. Justice wasn’t done.” In Cathy’s case, non-molestation orders had been issued against her ex-partner and she had moved house to evade him. Police had been called to 54 separate incidents involving the couple but on six occasions charges were dropped against her ex. On the night she fatally stabbed him, he had broken into her home and told her to remove her clothes. She later disclosed she thought he was going to rape her. After initially being charged with murder, she was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility – one of the partial defences. But legal experts say too often a lack of expertise or mistakes made early in a woman’s case mean the proper defences are not advanced. After Stella was arrested for killing her partner, police recorded that she was “shell shocked”. She said: “They told me he was gone. I couldn’t take it in and said, ‘I have got to be with him.’ I couldn’t imagine living with that… I was very suicidal [but] they thought I was fit for interview straight away.” Dr Catherine Durkin, a forensic psychiatrist for the NHS, says women who have suffered long-term abuse will often be in a state of severe shock when they enter the criminal justice system. “The stress of retelling the circumstances of their arrest in prolonged interviews and at trial can be so triggering of their underlying trauma that they experience dissociative or amnesic states. “This can impair their ability to recall information about the offence, but also to disclose the often highly distressing circumstances of past abuse,” explained Durkin, who carries out assessments on female prisoners. Women may struggle to engage with police and solicitors in the immediate aftermath of the killing but the details they share at that point can have important consequences for their trial. Defence lawyers interviewed said even when abuse was disclosed early there were cases where they believed a murder prosecution had been pursued inappropriately. One explained: “I have acted in several cases where there is significant evidence of history of abuse on the defendant which impacted her mental health and supported a partial defence to murder, where the CPS [Crown Prosecution Servce] could have charged with manslaughter and/or accepted a plea but have chosen to fight it.” Pleading guilty to manslaughter can avoid a murder conviction but entering a plea in this way can deny a woman access to the full defence of self-defence and the chance of being acquitted. Stacey Hyde, a troubled teenager who had suffered neglect and abuse as a child, was wrongly convicted of murdering Vincent Francis in 2010. She stabbed him after he attacked her friend, who the prosecution acknowledged had been subjected to violence by Francis on 27 previous occasions. Hyde appealed on the basis of fresh psychiatric evidence and offered a plea of manslaughter, which the evidence supported, according to her lawyers. “However the CPS was determined to pursue murder at retrial and opposed bail,” explained Wistrich. The jury later acquitted Hyde on the grounds of self-defence and she walked free having served six years imprisonment from age 17. Wistrich added: “In my experience the Crown will pursue murder convictions even following a successful appeal and regardless of compelling evidence of mitigation.” Just six women out of 92 were acquitted on the basis of self-defence while 14 had tried to run self-defence as part of their trial for murder and were convicted. The defence is “risky” according to some lawyers, and campaigners are calling for an amendment to this law to be added to the Domestic Abuse bill currently going through the House of Lords. But legislative reforms are limited without specialist understanding of domestic abuse across the justice system.The report, Women Who Kill: how the state criminalises women we might otherwise be burying, recommends mandatory training for police, lawyers and judges, especially around coercive control. Sally Challen was the first woman to have her murder conviction quashed in the wake of new coercive control laws which came into force in England and Wales in 2015. She killed her husband Richard in 2010 after four decades of being controlled and bullied by him. She was jailed for life with a minimum term of 22 years, later reduced to 18. But in a groundbreaking appeal judges heard new psychiatric evidence framing her case in the context of her husband’s controlling behaviour. Sally, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter, walked free after nine years due to time already served. She said: “Many women who are in prison today serving life sentences for murder have not had the domestic abuse they experienced properly explored during trial.” Louisa Rolfe, assistant commissioner of the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for domestic abuse, said officers receive training on coercive control, adding: “We have a responsibility to investigate every violent death, and consider all the evidence, including previous history, before we seek a decision from the CPS on whether a person should be charged and with what offence. “Our understanding of the devastating impact of living within an abusive relationship is developing all the time and we always seek to learn from any previous incidents, and we always seek to learn from any previous incidents” she said. A CPS spokesperson said: “We recognise the devastating impact of domestic abuse on victims, and prosecutors take all relevant factors into account when deciding the appropriate charge. Medical evidence, including on mental health, forms a key part of our considerations in these kinds of cases. “Every prosecution is kept under continuous review and, where there is consensus that a partial defence is available, we are unlikely to proceed with murder charges. However, experts will often disagree on this point and these matters may then be set before a jury to decide.” *Some names have been changed to protect identities"

They accuse the corporations of aiding and abetting the illegal enslavement of “thousands” of children on cocoa farms in their supply chains. Nestlé, Cargill, Barry Callebaut, Mars, Olam, Hershey and Mondelēz have been named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in Washington DC by the human rights firm International Rights Advocates (IRA), on behalf of eight former child slaves who say they were forced to work without pay on cocoa plantations in the west African country. The plaintiffs, all of whom are originally from Mali and are now young adults, are seeking damages for forced labour and further compensation for unjust enrichment, negligent supervision and intentional infliction of emotional distress. It is the first time that a class action of this kind has been filed against the cocoa industry in a US court. Citing research by the US state department, the International Labour Organization and Unicef, among others, the court documents allege that the plaintiffs’ experience of child slavery is mirrored by that of thousands of other minors. Ivory Coast produces about 45% of the global supply of cocoa, a core ingredient in chocolate. The production of cocoa in west Africa has long been linked to human rights abuses, structural poverty, low pay and child labour.
A central allegation of the lawsuit is that the defendants, despite not owning the cocoa farms in question, “knowingly profited” from the illegal work of children. According to the submissions, the defendants’ contracted suppliers were able to provide lower prices than if they had employed adult workers with proper protective equipment. The lawsuit also accuses the companies – whose industry body is the World Cocoa Foundation – of actively misleading the public in the voluntary 2001 Harkin-Engel Protocol, characterised by the complainants as promising to phase out some child labour (“the worst forms”, in the protocol’s words). The original deadline for achieving certain standards was 2005. In 2010, a follow-up framework of action for Ivory Coast and Ghana spoke of aiming for “a significant reduction” in the worst forms by 2020. In the legal claim, all eight plaintiffs describe being recruited in Mali through trickery and deception, before being trafficked across the border to cocoa farms in Ivory Coast. There, they were forced to work – often for several years or more – with no pay, no travel documents and no clear idea of where they were or how to get back to their families. The court papers allege that the plaintiffs, all of whom were under 16 years old at the time of their recruitment, worked on farms in major cocoa-producing areas of the country. The defendants’ apparent influence in these markets is described as “dominant” by the plaintiffs’ counsel. The lawsuit claims one plaintiff was only 11 years old when a local man in his home town of Kouroussandougou, Mali, promised him work in Ivory Coast for 25,000 CFA francs (£34) a month. The legal documents allege that the boy worked for two years without ever being paid, often applying pesticides and herbicides without protective clothing. The documents claim another child named as a plaintiff in the suit had visible cuts on his hands and arms from machete accidents. Speaking of his experience of forced labour between 2009 and 2011, he recalls being constantly bitten by insects. As with most of the plaintiffs, he claims in the lawsuit that he was promised payment after the harvest, but it never came. Many of the plaintiffs quoted in the court documents report being fed little and working long hours. Often, they claim they were kept alone or isolated from other child workers, who spoke different dialects.
During field work for this case, the plaintiffs’ legal team say that they routinely found children using machetes, applying chemicals and undertaking other hazardous tasks on cocoa plantations that were producing for one or more of the defendants. As well as being morally repugnant, such abuses against children represent a “humanitarian disaster” as they contribute to Ivory Coast’s ongoing poverty, the court papers state. The widespread use of child slavery is also credited by the plaintiffs for causing “long-term mental and physical trauma”. The case documentation maintains that the defendants are responsible for developing the entire cocoa production system of Ivory Coast. As key participants in this “venture”, it is claimed that they either knew or should have known about the “systematic” use of child labour. The case is being brought under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2017. IRA is currently involved in a separate complaint filed under the Alien Tort Statute against Nestlé and Cargill. In a statement Cargill said: “We are aware of the filing and while we cannot comment on specifics of this case right now, [the company wants] to reinforce we have no tolerance for child labor in cocoa production. Children belong in school. They deserve safe living conditions and access to good nutrition.” Nestlé said that the lawsuit “does not advance the shared goal of ending child labor in the cocoa industry” and added, “child labor is unacceptable and goes against everything we stand for. Nestlé has explicit policies against it and is unwavering in our dedication to ending it. We remain committed to combatting child labor within the cocoa supply chain and addressing its root causes as part of the Nestlé Cocoa Plan and through collaborative efforts.” Responding to news of the lawsuit, a Mars spokesperson said: “We don’t comment on any possible pending litigation.” Mondelēz said it did not wish to comment. Barry Callebaut said it has committed to eradicating child labour from its supply chain by 2025. “Every year we publish the progress we have made against this target in our Forever Chocolate progress report,” it said. An Olam spokesperson said that the company has a zero-tolerance policy for forced or slave labour in their supply chain. “If we were to identify any instances, we would immediately take action which includes notifying the appropriate authorities,” they said. A spokesperson for Hershey said: “We understand and agree with the concerns about the heartbreaking instances of child and forced labor. Hershey does not tolerate child or forced labor in our supply chain. These human rights violations have no place in the global cocoa industry, and we are committed to ending it. Effectively eliminating human rights violations and addressing the underlying issue of poverty that is the root cause of these labor violations requires significant investment and intervention on the ground in West Africa, not in the courts. “We have worked hard over the past several years to implement meaningful programs and work with our cocoa suppliers and West African governments to combat these issues and use our influence to make a positive impact.” • This article was amended on 19 February 2021. An earlier version said that in 2001 cocoa companies promised to “phase out” child labour. For avoidance of doubt, the words “phase out” were those of the complainants in the legal case."
2021-02-12T11:28:25Z,global-development,Global development,Pakistan ends death penalty for prisoners with severe mental health problems,"In a landmark decision, Pakistan’s supreme court ruled this week that prisoners with serious mental health problems cannot be executed for their crimes. The verdict was hailed by rights activists, who said it laid the groundwork for broader prison reforms in the country. On Wednesday, the court commuted the death sentences of Kanizan Bibi, 46, and Imdad Ali, 55, who have spent years on death row after being convicted of murder. Bibi and Ali were diagnosed with schizophrenia after their convictions. The judgment read: “If a condemned prisoner, due to mental illness, is found to be unable to comprehend the rationale and reason behind his/her punishment, then carrying out the death sentence will not meet the ends of justice.” Usama Malik, a human rights attorney, told the Guardian the supreme court had not “granted carte blanche relief to every prisoner on death row suffering from mental health issues”, but a medical board will now determine which prisoners “have such grave mental health issues that sending them to the gallows would be against the principle of retribution”. The court has also directed that prosecutors and trial judges be provided with training in how to assess mental health issues during trials.
Bibi was convicted when she was 16 of murdering the wife and five children of the wealthy landlord she worked for. In 2000 she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Ali was convicted of murdering a religious scholar in 2001. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2008. The Cornell Center on the Death Penalty Worldwide stated that Bibi was wrongfully convicted. She was allegedly tortured in police custody for several days before being sentenced to death in 1991. Bibi and Ali will now be transferred to a government-run mental health facility. Sarah Belal, executive director of Justice Project Pakistan, told the Guardian: “With this ruling, the supreme court of Pakistan has laid the groundwork for much broader prison reforms. It is a monumental judgment not only in terms of how it looks to uphold the rights of people with psychosocial disabilities, but also how it binds the federation and provinces to uphold the standards of due process and fairness.” Since 2014, 518 people have been executed in Pakistan, and 4,225 people are on death row. Pakistan halted capital punishment from 2008 to 2014 after pressure from international rights groups and campaigners. But in 2014, after a deadly Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar, stricter laws were introduced and the moratorium was lifted."
2021-02-12T07:15:36Z,global-development,Global development,"DRC is rich with farmland, so why do 22 million people there face starvation? | Vava Tampa","I was food shopping when I read the news. Nearly 22 million people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are facing starvation and malnutrition. Now. In 2021. You have to wonder how a country with eight months of rain, more than 50% of all the rivers, lakes and wetlands in Africa, and more agricultural land than any African country, with the potential to feed up to 2 billion people, gets to the point where it is unable to feed its population of 100 million. I felt broken, even guilty, and powerless. I reached for my phone and ended up surfing the net, reading one report after another; asking myself over and over again: how did we get to this? I first wrote about famine in the DRC in 2017, when 7.7 million people were on the verge of starvation. Then, the UN said the scale of the crisis was on a par with Syria and Yemen. Barely three years later it has surpassed Yemen to become the world’s worst famine crisis. Yet we still rarely hear anything about it. To put it in perspective, if the 22 million Congolese people facing starvation were a country, it would have a population larger than the Netherlands and Ireland combined – facing the world’s worst hunger and malnutrition crisis. Traditionally, famine has often been caused by wars and natural devastation such as drought. In the DRC’s case, however, impunity is the root cause. The terrible irony is the seed of this starvation was actually planted by the international community as early as 2010, when the UN published a groundbreaking mapping report, documenting 617 war crimes, crimes against humanity and even crimes of genocide committed in the DRC between 1993 and 2003. By then, Congolese people had already been ravaged by years of imported conflicts, which killed more than 5.4 million people between 1998 and 2008 – mostly through starvation or disease. Half of those who died were children – an entire generation, you could say – and fuelling these crises, according to the report, was impunity. Instead of creating an international criminal tribunal for the DRC to try the reported crimes and end the climate of impunity that has fuelled the violence, the international community chose to turn a blind eye, ostensibly for “peace”. Yet there is still no peace to keep. In my opinion, this was to protect their clients; people such as Joseph Kabila, president of the DRC from 2001 to 2019, whose security forces were linked to killings and torture, and the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, who allegedly supported the M23 militia gang responsible for atrocities in the DRC. In doing so, the international community has not only denied Congolese people justice but also sanctioned a culture of impunity. This impunity has continued to fuel insecurity, emboldening our killers and our rulers to do with us as they wish. It has fuelled violence and mass displacement to keep Congolese people cowed – and, in the process, destroyed farming and food production, which has inflamed an already dire humanitarian crisis. Here is a recent example of impunity. Last July, the DRC’s new president, Félix Tshisekedi, promoted General Gabriel Amisi, known as “Tango Four”, to the rank of army inspector general in spite of him being under US and EU sanctions for alleged human rights violations.
Then there are the growing numbers of militia who are killing Congolese people today. When the international criminal court was created in 2002, forcing Rwanda and Uganda to withdraw their invading troops, the DRC had fewer than 12 Kigali-Kampala-Kinshasa-backed militia groups. They killed for minerals such as tungsten, which makes the phone you are reading or tweeting this from vibrate when you receive a call or a message. Because of impunity, and in spite of tough conflict minerals laws in the US and EU, we now have more than 100 “devolved” militia groups killing, raping, looting and displacing people. This ratchets up our misery caused by diseases, displacement and destruction of local food production and food chains. This is how, 10 years after the UN mapping report, we find ourselves with nearly 22 million Congolese facing hunger and malnutrition. As I write, about 6.6 million Congolese are internally displaced because of violence; three times as many as in 2002. We also have more than 17,000 UN peacekeepers; almost four times as many as we had in 2002 but, because of impunity, there is still no peace to keep. I fear that until we create an international criminal tribunal for the DRC to end the impunity at the heart of these crises, more Congolese will be killed, displaced, raped and pushed into starvation. This is an internationally sanctioned catastrophe to which we all need to open our eyes. We are nearing an irreversible situation and risk losing another generation of Congolese people to starvation. Young Congolese have been using #CongoIsBleeding on social media to mobilise the world to act on the impunity that is fuelling violence, and fanning starvation and malnutrition. We should amplify their voices."
2021-02-11T13:12:53Z,global-development,Global development,"At least 331 human rights defenders were murdered in 2020, report finds","At least 331 human rights defenders promoting social, environmental, racial and gender justice in 25 countries were murdered in 2020, with scores more beaten, detained and criminalised because of their work, analysis has found. Latin America, the most dangerous continent in the world in which to protect environmental, land and human rights, accounted for more than three-quarters of all the murders of human rights defenders in 2020. In Colombia, where activists are routinely targeted by armed groups despite a 2016 peace deal, 177 such deaths were recorded, more than half of the global total. The Philippines was the second deadliest country with 25 murders, followed by Honduras, Mexico, Afghanistan, Brazil and Guatemala. While the majority (69%) of those killed were working on environmental, land or indigenous peoples’ rights, activists also found themselves being targeted simply for providing Covid-19 relief to their communities, according to a report published on Thursday by the advocacy group Front Line Defenders (FLD). In a year when many countries implemented lockdown measures to help stem the spread of the pandemic, human rights defenders provided much-needed support by delivering PPE, medicines and food to sick and elderly people, filling in gaps left by their governments. Despite this assistance – or perhaps because of it – they faced a variety of reprisals, ranging from arrest and harassment to physical violence and murder, said FLD’s head of protection, Ed O’Donovan. “The Covid-19 pandemic exposed many failures in many societies – notably systemic inequalities and failures of government to provide effective services to its citizens, which is sometimes by design,” O’Donovan said. “Much of this can be traced back to corruption and undemocratic systems in which transparency and accountability are anathema to the interests of the ruling elites, both political and economic. Human rights defenders and civil society have been filling those gaps – despite still being targeted – offering services and an alternative vision for societies.” O’Donovan said it was no surprise that in the Americas, activists working on impunity and justice issues suffered the second highest figure of violations against them, after those working on indigenous, land and environment rights. Twenty human rights defenders working on anti-corruption were also killed in 2020 – the highest figure ever documented by FLD. The report also found that: Indigenous activists made up nearly one third of the total of 331 human rights defenders killed worldwide, even though indigenous peoples comprise only about 6% of the global population A significant number of those murdered were working to stop extractive industry projects. They included the South African environmental activist Fikile Ntshangase, who was shot dead after opposing the extension of a coalmine near her home 13% of all those recorded killed were women Six transgender human-rights defenders were killed in 2020, all of them in the Americas While Covid-19 stalled some of the momentum of protest movements started in 2019, human rights defenders helped to remobilise, and in some countries, start movements during the last half of 2020, the report says. In Poland, activists fought for reproductive rights; in Bulgaria, they countered the corruption of the political elite; in the US, protests erupted over systemic racism; in Hong Kong, activists took to the streets to fight the introduction of an “Orwellian” national security law. That fewer countries were responsible for a higher number of deaths of human rights defenders in 2020 than 2019 – 331 killings in 25 countries last year compared with 304 killings in 31 countries in 2019 – proves that impunity reins when it comes to crimes against activists, even amidst widespread lockdowns and a global pandemic, said O’Donovan.
“Human rights defenders are always at risk and the lack of accountability and prosecution for their killings leaves virtually no cost for perpetrators,” said O’Donovan, adding that a handful of countries – among them Afghanistan, Colombia and Peru – were responsible for significant increases in murders in 2020. “In Peru, killings have increased from one in 2018 to eight in 2020; 75% of those killed in 2020 were indigenous, while all were working on land or indigenous issues, meaning that most, if not all, were located in more remote areas and up against corporate and state actors seeking control over land and natural resources,” said O’Donovan.
“In Colombia, armed groups enforced their own Covid-19 checkpoints and patrols in areas they control, thus exposing human rights defenders to greater risk.” The report comes in the same week that Amnesty International accused the UK government of failing on their pledge to protect human rights workers overseas. It said health workers, lawyers, journalists and rights activists around the world struggled to get support from British embassies. The FLD made a special note of both China and India’s “attempts to reduce and reframe normative human rights standards” on the global stage. The report also underlined China’s ongoing persecution of its Muslim-majority Uighur population, which has resulted in mass arbitrary detentions and surveillance, forced labour, forced sterilisation of Uighur women, and the death of at least one Uighur human rights defender, Tursun Kaliolla, a former civil servant who died in December 2020 while in custody in Xinjiang. FLD’s deputy director Olive Moore said that the 2020 figures demonstrated an “unconscionable” trend of violence against activists, and called for human rights defenders to be included in governments’ post-Covid planning, and at the Cop26 climate talks scheduled for November this year. “While 2020 was a difficult year for everyone, it was especially challenging for human rights defenders, who rose to meet unprecedented challenges. They faced increased attacks, economic insecurity, and the impact of illness and death on their communities, yet worked to fill voids left by insufficient government responses to the pandemic,” said Moore. “That they are under attack, as detailed in this report, is unconscionable.”"
2021-02-11T07:30:05Z,global-development,Global development,Colombia to grant legal status to Venezuelan migrants,"When Beritza Colina, 30, began the month-long march from Caracas, Venezuela’s capital, to Bogotá, the capital city of neighbouring Colombia, she was expecting the same frosty reception that thousands of her compatriots had received when they too crossed the border without papers. The near-900-mile journey with her five children was arduous, but without work in Caracas and such a large a family to raise, Colina saw little choice. “In Venezuela we couldn’t survive … we had to come here,” she said outside a clinic for migrants in Bogotá, having slept rough on the streets since crossing into Colombia at the end of last year. “We just hoped our situation would get easier.” On Monday, her prayers were answered when Colombia announced that it will grant legal status to an estimated 1 million undocumented Venezuelan migrants inside its borders, allowing them to work legally and access health and education services. Just over half of the 1.7 million Venezuelans in Colombia – about 950,000 people – have formal status. The protection status will last for 10 years. The decision was described as “the most important humanitarian gesture” in the region since the 1980s, as well as “an example to the region and the rest of the world”, by Filippo Grandi, the head of the UN refugee agency, who joined Colombia’s president Iván Duque in announcing the measures. Venezuela, despite having the world’s largest proven oil reserves, has been mired in economic and social ruin since 2014. Hyperinflation, food shortages and power cuts are a daily reality.
President Nicolás Maduro, who inherited power and the “Bolivarian revolution” from the late Hugo Chávez in 2013, has resisted efforts to oust him, and his security forces have violently clamped down on dissent. More than 4 million Venezuelans have fled the country, with Colombia the most popular destination. “Migration crises are by definition humanitarian crises,” Duque said on Monday, explaining the measures to a Colombian population that has at times bristled at the influx of Venezuelans and the strain it has placed on services. “We have close to a million migrants in our country whose names we don’t know,” he said. The move was celebrated by humanitarian organisations and governments around the world. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, congratulated Duque for the announcement on Twitter, adding that “The US stands with Colombia in support of refugees and migrants as we also work to rebuild and expand our humanitarian programmes worldwide.” In Bogotá, there was relief among undocumented migrants. “I slept easier last night than in years, and I was sleeping on the street,” said Colina.
For Andrea Guerra, 19, who has been undocumented in Colombia for three years, it was welcome news. “Now I can apply for real jobs, and I can think about building a real life here,” she said. The measures will also allow Venezuelan migrants to receive vaccinations against Covid-19, a reversal of the country’s position in December last year, when Duque said that Venezuelans without formal migratory status would not be eligible. In his announcement on Monday, the Colombian president called on the international community to help fund vaccination efforts for migrants. With the example now set, migrants and rights groups called on other countries in the region to relax their tough stance on Venezuelan migration. “This wasn’t something I was expecting, but it is among the best things that we could have hoped for,” said Dayana Mendoza, 43, a Venezuelan who runs Mujeres de Nueva Luz, a small foundation helping new arrivals find their feet in Colombia. “Hopefully other countries in the region will now follow Colombia and open their arms to us.”"
2021-02-11T06:30:04Z,global-development,Global development,‘It’s as if there’s no Covid’: Nepal defies pandemic amid a broken economy,"Traffic jams and soaring pollution levels are back. Political leaders are organising mass rallies, far more focused on fighting each other than any virus. If poorer Nepalis are struggling with the dire economic fallout from Covid-19, on the surface, at least, it appears daily life in the capital, Kathmandu, is back to normal. “It’s as if nothing has happened. The nightclubs are crowded. Schools and colleges are reopening. Sports venues are full. It doesn’t seem like there is any Covid,” says Sameer Mani Dixit, a public health specialist. “It defies logic.” With a weak public health system, families of several generations sharing crowded accommodation and a vast migrant workforce returning from India, the coronavirus looked likely to take a serious toll in Nepal, one of Asia’s poorest countries. Instead, the infection rate has fallen steadily, from an average of 3,000 daily cases in October to about 300 in January. Last week, Nepal recorded its first day since August without a Covid-related death. In total, just over 2,000 people have died since the beginning of the outbreak, in a population of nearly 30 million. “The number of cases is definitely going down. The hospital admission rate is very low … Overall, it seems the virus has been contained at this stage,” says Basu Dev Pandey, a former director of the government’s Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. Experts say it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind the country’s apparently low rate of infection, owing to a lack of reliable data, but Dr Anup Subedi, an infectious disease physician, points out that there has been limited testing and warns that the country is still vulnerable to new strains. “If new variants come, herd immunity doesn’t matter. Everyone becomes vulnerable again. My big fear is that this thing can explode again and we don’t have the measures in place to respond,” he says.
Although the government imposed a national lockdown in March, which ended in July, and barred even its own citizens from returning from overseas, critics say its management of the virus has been haphazard, with little proactive case tracing, few controls on the open border with India and an ineffective quarantine system. “The government has been very inefficient. There has been a reluctance to engage experts and use data and science. The prime minister has failed to follow public health advice. He has been giving mixed messages,” says Subedi. Amid the pandemic, the ruling Communist party has been preoccupied with infighting. Despite a large majority, the prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved parliament in December and called for early elections in an apparent bid to renege on a power-sharing agreement with a rival – a move his opponents claim is unconstitutional. The move has sparked a series of protest rallies organised by groups from across the political spectrum – rival factions of the Communist party, the opposition Nepali Congress party and civil society activists – with tens of thousands turning out.
But even as the health risks appear to recede, the economic fallout from the virus has been dire. Levels of unemployment and personal debt have soared, particularly for those working in tourism and the informal sector. Remittances from the millions of Nepalis working overseas have remained high, but the World Bank has estimated the economy grew by only 0.2% in 2020, down from 7% the previous year. On the southern edge of Kathmandu, Shova Shrestha used to made a living selling vegetables from a small cart. That came to an abrupt end when lockdown began and she has been unable to restart the business.
“Life after lockdown has been really hard for me. I’m looking for work but I can’t find anything. My husband has started drinking. I’m not able to pay school fees for my children,” says Shrestha. Around the towering peaks of the Everest region, the tourism industry has been devastated. The government had hoped to attract 2 million tourists in 2020, but only 230,000 arrived, and most of those in the months before lockdown, representing a fall of more than 80% against the previous year. Dingboche, a community on the well-trodden route to Everest base camp, used to see 500 to 700 trekkers a day during the busiest season, but since the start of the pandemic the flow of tourists, and money, has stopped. Nyima Tsering Sherpa, who runs a lodge in the village, says: “Almost everyone in this region depends on tourism, but we have not earned a single thing since March. Now we are just relying on savings. At first, people were afraid of the virus, but now the only concern is a lack of money.”
On Nepal’s southern plains, one of the poorest regions in the country, the virus has left already poor and marginalised groups struggling to survive. The Harawa-Charawa, a community of indentured agricultural labourers, often forced to work for landlords in order to pay back high-interest debts, have been particularly hard hit.
During lockdown, many were unable to travel to their landlord’s fields, leaving them with no source of wages. Tens of thousands of migrant workers returned from India or Nepal’s cities, further increasing the pressure on household incomes. Many Harawa-Charawa families were forced to rely on handouts or in some cases took further high-interest loans, pushing them deeper into debt. Those who could work were paid even less than usual – as little as £1.25 a day – as landlords took advantage of the desperate circumstances.
“The local government gave 10kg of rice only once in the name of relief. It didn’t even feed our family for a week. The lack of livelihood has become very difficult,” says community activist Lagendra Sada. The coronavirus pandemic has exposed entrenched social problems: poor governance, caste discrimination, a lack of jobs and widespread poverty, says Kanchan Jha, the director of Sano Paila, an organisation supporting marginalised communities. “People are losing their jobs. Frustration and anger are on the rise,” says Jha. “I fear there may be conflicts in the future.”"
2021-02-10T10:30:39Z,global-development,Global development,Can Addis Ababa stop its architectural gems being hidden under high-rises?,"Only rubble remains of the former home of Dejazmatch Asfaw Kebede, a member of Emperor Haile Selassie’s government. Built in the early 1900s, and inspired by Indian as well as Ethiopian architecture, the building was demolished in early January without the knowledge of Addis Ababa’s conservation agency, the Culture and Tourism Bureau. Demolition and reconstruction are now the most common sights along Addis Ababa’s unrecognisably altered skeleton skyline. The collateral damage is the city’s heritage. While tourist organisations boast that Ethiopia is the cradle of humanity, the capital is being stripped of its past. Heritage defines a city and shapes it socially, historically and culturally. It is impossible to imagine Athens without the Parthenon, Cairo without the pyramids, Rome without the Colosseum. While Ethiopia’s national heritage of dramatic, ancient sites is valued and mostly protected, conserving urban heritage appears to be at best an afterthought, and at worst an inconvenience.
Buffet de la Gare, a canteen that hosted Ethiopia’s musical legends in the 60s and 70s, was levelled to erect a Gulf-style luxury development. Meskel Square, the city’s most important public space, is like a building site, in complete upheaval. The 1930s villas in Kazanchis, less than a mile from Meskel Square, have been lost under a high-rise development scheme. The dramatic changes of the past 20 years and demise of much historic architecture are not anomalies. A vast urban makeover is continuing. Of the heritage buildings listed by the Culture and Tourism Bureau, about 8% have been demolished.
The bulldozing has sparked outcry from some of the city’s most prominent architects and planners. Fasil Giorghis, chair of conservation of urban and architectural heritage at Addis Ababa University, has argued that the destruction reflects a fundamental “lack of consciousness, lack of awareness of the value of heritage”. As a former empire, Ethiopia has a long history of centralised planning. Now, an absence of community engagement and growth in profit-driven development means heritage concerns are disregarded. It’s often argued that preserving urban heritage hinders economic growth. However, the opposite is true. The recently opened Unity Park, constructed at the grand palace of Emperor Menelik II, shows that urban conservation can open up vital tourism opportunities. Sadly, such developments are, for now, exceptions to the rule.
“Addis Ababa is beginning to look like an imitation of some other city,” says Esther Sellassie Antohin, founder and director of Heritage Watch, which advocates for the restoration of urban heritage in Ethiopia. “There’s a hollowness, there are disconnections, a disjointedness that presents a problem.” Statues glorify, but heritage buildings expose historical nuances and complexities. They offer a physical window into the lives of those who came before us. It is not merely the brick, the concrete, the plaster, the hours of sweat and labour, and the endless economic investments that are lost when heritage is razed – pillaging architectural history fosters collective amnesia.
Architect Medhanie Teklemariam, who was instrumental in making Asmara, Eritrea a Unesco world heritage site, says: “Destroying heritage buildings means destroying your history. The destruction of any part of it leaves us poorer.” Giorghis adds: “Any society has to have a healthy relationship with what is the past, the present and its future. Otherwise, what we do to our historic buildings, the next generation will do to our buildings.”
Indeed. Contemporary architecture might be felled by future regimes, continuing the cycle of architectural impermanence. As Ethiopia’s largest city, Addis Ababa is experiencing a surge in urbanisation as young people move in from rural areas in search of jobs. This shift demands investment in housing, transport and sanitation systems. However, the city is constrained in spreading outwards, after the debacle of the “master plan” for expansion. The plan, unveiled in 2014, resulted in waves of social unrest and conflict with the surrounding Oromia regional administration and was abandoned in 2016. So Addis Ababa must grow upwards, requiring high-rises and inner-city renewal.
The way we become “modern” is not by negating our past and severing ourselves from all that has made us with flashy Dubai and Hong Kong-inspired aesthetics. There is much to learn from traditional architecture and design, which reflects culture and patterns of collective behaviour, in informing how we build communities. Some within the city administration understand the importance of maintaining collective memories. Heritage buildings in the neighbourhoods of Arada and Beherawi are being refurbished to become public spaces for urban tourism, showing development and conservation need not be in conflict. “It is not to say that development should stop,” says Giorghis. “It is to say that we have a different kind of development. A development that gives some respect and consideration to the existing urban fabric.” As waves of migration point to an urban future for Ethiopia, a fresh look at city development is desperately needed, one that designs and builds not on top of, but among layers of the past.

2021-02-10T08:45:30Z,global-development,Global development,Lawyers protesting against police in Tunisia allegedly attacked by officers ,"Three lawyers are said to be recovering after being assaulted by police in the wake of protests in the Tunisian capital on Saturday. According to the Tunisian Bar Association, Yassine Azaza and Rahhal Jallali were attacked by officers while they were making their way home after the demonstrations in Tunis. A third lawyer, Abdennaceur Aouini, was photographed surrounded by police officers in the city’s main street. Large crowds of young activists and union members negotiated police checkpoints and roadblocks to demonstrate against the security services, as well as mark the assassination of Chokri Belaid, a leftist opposition leader, eight years ago. Saturday’s protests were the latest in a series of demonstrations since mid January. Tunisian police appear to have been targeting protesters and activists in response to the “humiliation” the police unions claim members experienced during a previous protest when activists threw paint at police lines and posed for images in front of officers holding riot shields. Serving officers and social media accounts linked to unions appear to have been threatening protesters photographed at previous demos. A Facebook spokesperson said the company had taken down some of the threats: “Keeping people safe is something we take extremely seriously and it is against our community standards to share personally identifiable information about others when it could lead to physical harm. In this case, we have removed a number of pieces of content for breaking these standards, including our rules on bullying and harassment.” Tunisia’s police are said to have arrested more than 1,600 mostly young people for their part in the unrest. According to the Tunisian Human Rights League, many were minors, with a large number allegedly denied medical attention after having been beaten by police. One young man arrested in the coastal town of Monastir required emergency surgery on his genitals after what his lawyer claimed was torture in police custody.
Encouraged by many of the civil society groups that now resist them, Tunisia’s security sector trade unions emerged after the country’s historic revolution of 2011, with the initial aim of securing rights denied to officers under past autocracies. But the unions have been accused of having gone to extraordinary lengths to protect members’ interests. In addition to the targeting of protesters, this is said to have included the manipulation of evidence after an alleged assault on a lawyer by police officers and the storming of a court after the trial of five colleagues who had been accused of torture. Tunisia’s protests earlier in the year against high unemployment, especially among young people, appear to have largely petered out. In their place are larger-scale protests by established civil society groups, decrying police violence while calling for the overhaul of archaic drug laws and greater protections for sexual minorities. In a meeting last week with security chiefs, Hichem Mechichi, the prime minister and acting interior minister, appeared to offer support for the police tactics."
2021-02-10T07:15:28Z,global-development,Global development,"UK failing to protect human rights defenders abroad, says Amnesty","The UK government has failed in its pledge to help those on the frontline of the global fight for human rights during the pandemic, according to a new report. Amnesty International said health workers, lawyers, journalists and rights activists from around the world who were living under constant threat during the Covid-19 pandemic struggled to get support or funding from British embassies. The group’s researchers interviewed 82 human rights defenders from seven countries: Egypt, Colombia, Russia, Zimbabwe, the Philippines, Afghanistan and Libya, and 94% said the government had offered them very little help in response to threats or attacks against them. In its report, the organisation found that only 40% had been in contact with the UK within the past two years; 70% were in contact with embassies of other countries. Additionally, 76% did not know how to contact someone at their closest British embassy and 75% had never received UK funding. Amnesty director Kate Allen said these individuals were “holding governments to account for their Covid-19 response plans” and “shining a light on the impact of this deadly disease”. But instead of being “recognised for their bravery, many have been targeted and are experiencing attacks”, she said, and faced “reduced protection and draconian repression disguised as emergency responses”. Allen added that the UK government had pledged to stand up for those putting their lives at risk to help others, but said “words” needed to be “turned into action”. In several countries, health workers and journalists who spoke out about Covid-19 during the pandemic were attacked. In Egypt, health workers and human rights defenders who spoke out were charged with spreading “false news”.
One told Amnesty: “We have been victims of a smear campaign that even targeted us personally. The news published false information about me, alleging that because I was meeting a lot of foreigners, I had contracted Covid-19 and I was spreading it.” As journalists and critics continue to face arrest, Amnesty found that those already in prison were excluded from government measures to release prisoners in response to coronavirus outbreaks. In Turkey, measures explicitly excluded those in pre-trial detention, and those who are on remand for or have been convicted of offences under Turkey’s anti-terrorism laws. They include political and human rights activists, journalists and academics. Iranian authorities temporarily released 85,000 prisoners – but excluded many human rights defenders held in poor conditions on politically motivated charges. In the Philippines, Cristina Palabay, secretary general of rights group Karapatan, said: “Covid has shrunk the space for LGBTQI+ people and community in the Philippines to express their identity.” The report suggests how the government can prioritise human rights defenders in foreign policy, calling for a strategic approach to better support those under attack and push back against the global trend towards repression. A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: “From equipping human rights defenders with digital skills to funding essential security training, the UK provides millions of pounds every year backing initiatives which defend democratic values and the rule of law. “The UK leads calls for stronger protections for human rights defenders with our international partners and has set out clear guidance for NGOs on how our posts can best support them.”"
2021-02-10T05:30:26Z,global-development,Global development,"Family of girl, 12, forced to marry abductor condemn Pakistan authorities","The family of a 12-year-old girl in Pakistan who was chained up in a cattle pen for more than six months, after allegedly being kidnapped and forced to marry her abductor, have attacked the authorities for refusing to act. The case is among those now being examined by a government inquiry into the forced conversions of religious minority women and girls, after police released the man, saying they believed the girl had married him of her own free will. The child was taken from her home in Faisalabad last June and had been held at the home of 29-year-old Khizer Hayat, where she was made to work clearing animal dung. Her family are angry that no further action has been taken against the man. Police investigators initially held Hayat but then released him, saying there was no evidence the girl had not consented to the marriage and that a medical report said she was 16.
“The case has been taken up by the parliamentary committee of human rights in the Senate of Pakistan and police are attending the committee’s hearings. She confessed before the magistrate … that she married Khizer Hayat of her own free will and she wants to live with him,” said Musaddiq Riaz, a detective with Faisalabad police. The father of the girl – who is not being named to protect her identity – told the Guardian that the police had discovered his daughter at a house in Hafizabad, 110km (68 miles) from her home. “They repeatedly raped my daughter. She was in trauma after being subjected to physical and mental torture. They had forcibly converted her to Islam. She was kept as a slave and forced to work having a chain attached to her ankles. Police were not registering my complaint and threatened me [for] being a minority Christian and used discriminatory remarks,” he said. “She was brought to the police station after negotiations with her abductors and she was bandaged at the police station,” he said. “She was traumatised and I still can’t believe she testified in favour of her kidnappers.” He disputed the court report and showed his daughter’s birth certificate along with photographs of deep cuts and sores on her ankles. According to a 2019 report by the human rights commission of Pakistan, an estimated 1,000 Christian and Hindu women are abducted and forcibly married every year. Many of the victims are minors. Sexual assaults and fraudulent marriages are used by perpetrators to entrap victims, and authorities rarely intervene. Pakistan’s tiny Christian population of about 2.5 million in the Muslim majority country of 223 million faces frequent discrimination. In 2020 a 14-year-old Catholic girl from Faisalabad was kidnapped at gunpoint and forced to “marry” her 45-year-old kidnapper. She managed to escape and is in hiding with her parents after a court ruled she must return to her abductor. Lala Robin Daniel, an activist based in Faisalabad, said of the recent case: “Despite the parliamentary Senate committee for human rights hearings, I am not hopeful that justice will be served to the poor family. She was injured and in a state of trauma. “Teenage girls from religious minority groups are often targeted for forced conversions and marriages due to certain gaps in the law and weak laws. Police and judiciary make fun of the parents seeking justice,” she said. John Pontifex, of Catholic organisation Aid to the Church in Need, said the British government should be looking at the issue: “This case should sound a warning shot to the UK government, questioning the efficacy of its aid strategy, which for years prioritised funding to Pakistan. Given the institutionalised nature of abuse of young girls of minority faith backgrounds, we should in good conscience ask: is UK aid to Pakistan being used wisely? Is it aiding the girls or abetting the problem?” He added: “We receive reports every week of incidents in which girls of minority faith backgrounds are abducted, gang-raped, forcibly converted and who are made to marry their abductor. “And it seems the state is complicit by failing to investigate cases, failing to bring the perpetrators to justice and sanctioning child marriages.” In December, Pakistan’s prime minister Imran Khan ordered an inquiry into the forced conversions of religious minority women and girls. Tahir Mehmood Ashrafi, Khan’s special representative for religious harmony, said: “We are aware of the incident and the state of Pakistan is fully committed to ensure justice to minorities whether it’s forced marriage or forced conversion. “We will not tolerate these acts. We will pursue the case, no one is above the law and we will take serious action against the culprits … We are working on the formulation of interfaith harmony councils at the local level to ensure minority protection and to resolve such cases promptly.”"
2021-02-09T14:39:31Z,global-development,Global development,Myanmar protests: woman shot in head as police response escalates ,"Police in Myanmar have responded with increasing violence to protests against last week’s military coup, using water cannons, rubber bullets and live ammunition in a crackdown that left a woman in a critical condition on Tuesday. Tens of thousands of people marched in towns and cities across the country in defiance of a ban on gatherings in some areas to voice their opposition to the military takeover of the government. The police response the past three days had been mostly limited to using water cannons to disperse crowds, but escalated on Tuesday to include rubber bullets and live rounds mostly fired into the air as warning shots. Four people were taken to hospital in the capital Naypyidaw with what doctors initially said they believed were wounds caused by rubber bullets. One of them, a young woman, was struck in the head while wearing a motorcycle helmet and suddenly collapsed to the ground, video footage showed. The round was still lodged in her body and the wound was likely to be fatal, a doctor in the city told Reuters. “She hasn’t passed away yet, she’s in the emergency unit, but it’s 100% certain the injury is fatal,” said the doctor, who added that senior colleagues involved in her treatment had assigned him to speak to the media. “According to the X-ray, it’s a live bullet.” A man had a chest wound but was not in critical condition, the doctor said, and it was not clear if he was hit with a bullet or rubber bullet. Neither police nor the hospital responded to a request for comment. Earlier, officers had used water cannons to beat back the crowd, and demonstrators had responded by throwing projectiles. Footage on social media showed people running, with the sound of several gunshots in the distance.
Opponents of the 1 February coup also gathered in Yangon and Mandalay, where evening curfews have been instituted and gatherings of more than five people are banned. Teargas was used against crowds in Mandalay, where police arrested at least 27 anti-coup demonstrators, including a journalist, media organisations said. A journalist from the Democratic Voice of Burma said he was detained after filming the rally and that people were beaten. Two media organisations confirmed the arrests. The United Nations expressed “strong concern” over reports of numerous people being injured. “The use of disproportionate force against demonstrators is unacceptable,” said Ola Almgren, the UN resident coordinator and humanitarian coordinator in Myanmar. The military takeover followed an election in November decisively won by Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy that army leaders claim was fraudulent. The detention of Aung San Suu Kyi sparked outrage across the south-east Asian country of 53 million, and a growing civil disobedience movement affecting hospitals, schools and government offices. Demonstrations were also held on Tuesday in other cities, including Bago – where city elders negotiated with police to avoid a violent confrontation – and Dawei, and in northern Shan state. In Magwe in central Myanmar unconfirmed reports on social media claimed several police officers had crossed over to join the protesters’ ranks. Footage showed several officers running into a crowd being sprayed with water and using their shields to block the flow, as other officers tried to pull them back into formation.
A video posted online from the delta city of Pathein appeared to show protesters persuading some police officers to stand down. “We know that you are human and have hearts that feel just like us,” one of the crowd of thousands could be heard telling officers at a barricade. An officer gestured that he could hear the demonstrators, drawing applause and loud cheers, and policemen started shaking hands with protesters and removing the barricade. The crowd marched past chanting, “The people’s police”. Outside Hledan Centre, a mall in Yangon, a crowd faced off against police barricades singing protests songs and chants despite the searing temperature. “We don’t care about the heat,” said a 24-year old protester who asked not to be named. “We want the police to join us. It is the army we are worried about. If they are told to shoot people, they will shoot.”
Large crowds again gathered near Sule Pagoda in downtown Yangon, where one witness estimated there were tens of thousands on the streets by mid morning. Martial law and rumours of incoming soldiers had created an atmosphere of unease, but protesters were determined. Pyae Phyo, 33, was gathered with his friends from the Myanmar Seamen Union under the shade of a tree near Sule Pagoda. “Because of last night’s martial law announcement I thought people may not come,” he said. “But they have come. I am so proud of my people. Every day we will come here. Every day we aren’t free we will protest peacefully.”
The protesters carried anti-coup placards including, “We want our leader”, in reference to Aung San Suu Kyi, and, “No dictatorship”. Pockets of ambulances manned by a network of volunteer doctors and medical workers were stationed near Sule Pagoda. Myat Moe Lwin, 25, a graduate doctor, and his colleague Kaung Pyae Sone Thin, 25, were waiting near the ambulances and were prepared to aid injured protesters. “So many people are protesting against the coup,” he said. “We had to help if there are any problems. It is our professional duty.” There was confusion over the reach of section 144 of the penal code, which bans gatherings of five or more people. The US embassy said it had received reports of an 8pm to 4am local time curfew in the two biggest cities, Yangon and Mandalay. Western governments have widely condemned the coup, although there has been little concrete action. The UN human rights council will hold a special session on Friday to discuss the crisis.

2021-02-09T10:00:09Z,global-development,Global development,'We're double-dipping': Trudeau pressured to speed vaccine distribution amid Covax backlash,"Justin Trudeau is facing growing pressure to speed up Canada’s sluggish distribution of the coronavirus vaccine, as the country fends off accusations that it is taking supplies of the drug meant for developing countries. The federal government drew sharp criticism last week when it announced that it would draw on Covax, a mechanism created to fairly distribute Covid-19 doses around the world, for its supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Canada is entitled to receive shots through the Covax program, which uses advance purchases by wealthy nations to subsidise doses for poorer countries. But it had already completed a series of direct deals with pharmaceutical companies to secure its own supply, prompting accusations of “double-dipping”.
“Turning to Covax demonstrates the desperation of the Trudeau government in terms of its vaccine policy,” said Jillian Kohler, a University of Toronto professor focused on global access to medicines. “Taking [vaccine supply] from a multilateral institution that was designed particularly to help the world’s poor is shocking and an embarrassment.” The decision prompted condemnation by other party leaders, who questioned the ethical implications of the decision and its effect on Canada’s global standing. “We should not be double-dipping into this mechanism. It’s very bad for Canadians, it’s very bad for our image,” the Green party leader, Annamie Paul, told reporters. Trudeau and his team have defended the move, saying that half of Canada’s $C440m investment was set aside for domestic supply. “Our contribution was always intended to access vaccine doses for Canadians as well as to support lower-income countries,” the prime minister said last week. But Kohler, who previously developed global pharmaceutical policies for a number of UN organizations, said that the decision to draw on Covax reflected a broader domestic failure to secure a consistent vaccine supply. Last year, Trudeau’s government made agreements with manufacturers that gave it one of the highest per-capita supplies of coronavirus vaccines in the world. As the drugs finally roll out, however, Canada has been hit with delays. Last week, no vaccines arrived from Pfizer and the government expects a dip in Moderna’s shipments. As a result of shortages and domestic fumbles, Canada has only vaccinated 2.38% of its population, one of the lowest rates among developed nations. Many of Canada’s vaccine woes are tied to the reality that it has no domestic production capacity. Other countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Australia and South Korea, have made deals with drug companies to produce their own supply, but all of Canada’s requests to licence domestic manufacturing have been rebuffed by drug companies. The government has announced the development of a new domestic vaccine production facility, but it won’t become operational until 2022, and critics have questioned why investment in production wasn’t stepped up sooner. Even Canada’s largest trading partner, the US, appears unwilling to help. Donald Trump signed an executive order that ensured the first 100m vaccines produced at Pfizer’s Michigan plant would go to Americans. His successor, Joe Biden, does not appear interested in reversing the policy, meaning Canada’s Pfizer supply must ship from Belgium. Trudeau says Canada remains on track to get 6m doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines by the end of March and 20m in the spring. But the recent stumbles have proven costly for the prime minister, who is considering the prospect of a spring election. Until recently, Trudeau enjoyed widespread support for his government’s handling of the pandemic, scoring extra points for securing a large number of vaccine doses. But a recent poll from Angus Reid Institute found confidence in the vaccine rollout had dropped nearly 10 points over the last six weeks. Another survey found negative sentiment towards the government’s handling of the issue had jumped 19 points since mid-January. “We’re dealing with a pandemic. People are dying, we have serious variants in Canada. This is not the time to be messing up on policy,” said Kohler. “It didn’t have to happen this way. It didn’t have to be this bad and this outrageous.”"
2021-02-09T08:00:06Z,global-development,Global development,"Rise in child abuse online threatens to overwhelm UK police, officers warn","The vast, and growing, volume of child abuse material being created and shared online is threatening to overwhelm police efforts to tackle it, senior officers have told the Guardian. And the situation is likely to worsen, National Crime Agency (NCA) child abuse lead Rob Jones warned, if social media sites such as Facebook press ahead with further encryption of messaging services. Law enforcement against online child abuse in the UK was “the best in the world by some distance”, Jones said. “But we are arresting and dealing with more offenders than ever, the numbers are growing and growing, as are the number of children being safeguarded.” The numbers involved are staggering. The UK’s child abuse image database has 17m unique images on it, and it is growing by 500,000 every two months. Children were posting pictures of themselves online and predators were targeting them, Jones explained. “Children sharing videos and photos online has exploded,” he said. “And once a child posts an image it can become a honey pot for offenders posing as children. They link and chat to the child and it is very, very quick that the child is compromised. Often they are too scared to reach out for help.”
Simon Bailey, the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for child protection, described the horror of this abuse, which mainly targets girls aged between 11 and 13. “You see a young person who is being told to insert objects inside themselves, and in the background you hear mum calling them down for their dinner.” Once images of the child have been sent to an abuser, “they are out in the wild, recirculating,” Jones warned. ‘They are told to abuse a child to gain entry’ One of the key messages Jones wants to get across is that when abusive images are shared it is not on the dark web, but on open, easy-to-access sites. “Child abuse is three or four clicks away,” he said. “There is no block, no barrier to entry at all. Any search engine will allow people with a sexual interest in children to meet like-minded individuals who normalise it, rationalise it, encourage it. They will then move to closed chat forums where they will be told they need to abuse a child to gain entry to image-sharing sites.” All of this, he said, was exacerbated by children’s increasing dependence on the online world. “[The lockdown] has seen children completely relying on the internet to live their lives,” he pointed out. “And keeping pace with that dependence is difficult for parents.” A key part of the work the NCA does is to stop children being “revictimised” as their images are shared again and again by paedophiles. One way this is done is using photo hashes, digital files that match known images of child abuse and are used to scan sites such as Facebook, Google or the game platform Roblox. Facebook has said it plans to encrypt its Messenger service, bringing it in line with WhatsApp and Instagram, which it also owns. “If encryption goes ahead we stand to lose it all,” Jones said. “As companies move to end-to-end encryption there is a real risk that all the leads we talk about, the monitoring of known images that often lead us directly to offenders, will be lost. “More and more children are being groomed and abused and it’s not as if the industry doesn’t know this. They are fully informed and have chosen to ignore the horrors of what we find daily.” Last month, Facebook told British MPs that encryption would mean scanning technologies would no longer pick up as much child abuse material. Monika Bickert, the firm’s head of global policy management, told the home affairs select committee that the company would not be able to pass on as many reports of child abuse. “I would expect the numbers to go down. If content is being shared and … it’s content we cannot see then it’s content we cannot report,” she said.
Responding to the criticism from the NCA, a spokesperson for Facebook insisted that they would still be tackling abuse on their platforms: “Facebook has led the industry in developing new ways to prevent, detect, and respond to abuse. End-to-end encryption is already the leading technology used by many services to keep people safe online and, when we roll it out on our other messaging services, we will build on our strong anti-abuse capabilities at WhatsApp. For example, WhatsApp bans around 250,000 accounts each month suspected of sharing child exploitative imagery.” Between April and September last year, 4,700 people, nearly all men, were arrested for online child abuse offences and more than 6,000 children were safeguarded. Jones is particularly concerned over the growth of live streaming, where paedophiles pay to watch children abused in poorer countries. “Live streaming is a marker for severe offending,” he said. “That is what is terrifying about this casework. Offenders have become so desensitised that to receive sexual gratification they will ask for very specific, bespoke abuse to be carried out.” “My great fear,” Jones added, “is that with increasing access to technology around the world, more children and poor families who can’t afford to feed their children will be exposed to this risk.” Because live streaming is difficult to track in real time it was vital, Bailey and Jones said, to protect access to messaging services where images will be shared. “This is the low-hanging fruit,” Jones said. “The monitoring of known images can often lead us directly to offenders. The technology is there to prevent it, but the internet companies are not doing enough to tackle the threat.”"
2021-02-09T07:15:05Z,global-development,Global development,"As a poor Ugandan farmer, white and black people ignore my advice on poverty","Being poor, black and from sub-Saharan Africa is the hardest thing you can ever be. But that is what I am. Before Covid-19 came, extreme poverty had largely become a problem of only one part of the world – sub-Saharan Africa. According to the World Bank in 2018, the region was projected to host more than 90% of the world’s extreme poor by 2030. That means that more than 400 million people were expected to live on less than $1.90 (£1.40) a day a decade away from now, in sub-Saharan Africa alone, before the arrival of Covid-19. And as the pandemic devastated every country across the world, it unleashed the most profound economic pain on the poor. Even in the post-pandemic world, the poor are still the people who will have the lowest level of resilience, and little or nothing to count on in the rebuilding process. Africa itself isn’t created equal. More than 70% of the extreme poor in the region, according to the World Bank, live in only 10 of the 46 countries that comprise sub-Saharan Africa. My country, Uganda, is one of those 10. Uganda is even among the five poorest countries worldwide.
I am a farmer who has spent most of my life in extreme poverty, here in eastern Uganda, and I really want to see some change. At this point, though, I am inclined to believe this may be impossible because of white people, and black people, globally. Why? White people, who make up most of the global development sector, tend to be very sensitive when a rural poor African like me has anything to say about poverty, for example about what needs to be done to accelerate an end to it – and they will therefore try to ensure that people like me aren’t heard anywhere. And that is an understatement. On the other hand, Africa’s own kinspeople – black people both in Africa and in the diaspora – tend to be very defensive, and very dismissive, in response to any mention of the need for the black community to work together and help our motherland.
Many black people are even keen to keep such a conversation out of the mainstream, for fear that it might change the narrative and make other people start questioning why it isn’t common for black people, especially those who are a little better off, to help. In a protracted effort to ease the grip of poverty where I live, I have contacted every black activist, everypan-Africanist, and every black influencer from Lagos to Hollywood, not to mention scores of black international journalists. So, I have some idea of what I am talking about. For white people – again, most of the global development sector – any suggestion by a person like me about the need to put the poor themselves directly in charge of ending poverty, is perceived as an act of being taken to task by the people they already claim to help very effectively.
Many in the development sector also have a few other fears, including the belief that ordinary poor Africans like me might in reality be fraudsters. So a genuine effort to end global poverty must instead be led by some more “legitimate” people, ie: white people – hence the need to keep people like me at bay. This has ensured that nearly all global anti-poverty interventions in Africa are top-bottom (or trickle-down), and largely short-lived, but it has also meant that in most rural poor communities, there is simply nothing happening to end poverty. A few statistics? According to the South Africa-based civil society advocacy alliance Civicus, only 1% of all official aid (ie funding from agencies like USAid and UKAid), and an even smaller portion of all humanitarian assistance (that is, all charitable global anti-poverty funding), goes directly to grassroots organisations in the global south. For their part, some black people seem to be motivated by the vulnerability of the black race, as the main reason for wanting to mute any conversation about the need for the black community to help Africa end poverty. There are many who find it easy to simply say to themselves, “I’m just another black person, and I had to find my own way up”, when they are asked for a helping hand by those of us who live in ultra-poverty. But the thing is: the black community, especially those in the diaspora, have many more networks and connections than those of us on the continent, and the most precious thing that they can do to help people like us end poverty isn’t necessarily to give us money, but a voice.
But even cash-wise, there are many who have what it takes to lend a hand to those of us who have absolutely nothing here in Africa, if only we as black people believed in each other. My experience with white people and black people thus far has come from making extensive contact with both. I have tried to talk to so many activists and organisations around the world who say they are interested in reducing poverty. All this I did from the very remote, poor village of Namisita, where I live, and where I am seated now – aided by a solar panel, an ageing laptop, and a mobile internet connection; worried about even the smallest expenses – in the hope that since there was nothing else happening to end poverty in our region, and since no other farmer here knew what to do about our plight, that maybe my effort would pay off. It didn’t. This is what makes being poor, black and sub-Saharan African the hardest thing you can ever be. Anthony Kalulu is a farmer in Namisita, a village in a remote part of Kamuli, eastern Uganda. He is also founder of the nonprofit Uganda Community Farm, working to end extreme poverty"
2021-02-09T06:30:04Z,global-development,Global development,Autism in India: how a pioneering jobs scheme is opening up opportunities,"Talking to people can be difficult for Rishabh Birla, but his last job demanded he did a lot of it. He has autism and finds making eye contact uncomfortable. For Birla, the rules of conversation are puzzling and he sometimes veers off course, alarming the other person. A 25-year-old postgraduate, Birla had been working at a cosmetics startup in Thane, not far from Mumbai. “The job involved communicating with different clients to keep track of their orders. It was exhausting to interact with so people every day,” he says. When he heard last year that Ernst & Young (EY) was recruiting people with autism, learning disabilities, dyspraxia, Asperger’s syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to their Mumbai office, he applied. His decision was based more on wanting to experience a corporate recruitment process than any real expectation of securing a job, he says. After a specially designed process broken down into stages and spread over two months, Birla was offered a job as an analyst. “My family and I were elated. This is a major milestone in my life personally and professionally,” he says. The job offers to Birla and four others from a shortlist of 13 candidates were part of EY’s new initiative on neurodiversity, an umbrella term that refers to variations in neurocognitive functioning. Since EY pioneered recruitment of a neurodiverse workforce at its Philadelphia, US office in 2016, it has become more widely accepted within the company that neurodivergent individuals often have specialised contributions to make in the workplace, particularly in the booming sectors of artificial intelligence, robotics and process automation. Recruiting neurodivergent people is not about corporate social responsibility, but a business imperative.
“We see a clear role for neurodiverse candidates in these areas,” says Amarpal Chadha, partner at EY’s People Advisory Services. “These individuals are often technologically inclined and detail-oriented, with strong skills in analytics, mathematics, pattern recognition and information processing – among the very skills businesses most urgently need.” When the impact of the first neurodivergent recruits to the Philadelphia office was assessed, their efficiency and productivity were comparable to those of other employees. But they were much better at innovation. One group identified improvements that cut the time for technical training in half, automating processes much more quickly. In one project, the perspective brought by a neurodiverse team was estimated to save 800 hours. In another, the combined time savings and quality improvements generated around $100,000 (£73,000) in cost savings. Projects expected to take up to five weeks were finished in three days. EY India adapted every step of the recruitment process to match the needs of neurodivergent candidates and gauge their potential. Informal and unscripted chats replaced a standard interview, allowing candidates to demonstrate their abilities in a more relaxed setting and over a longer period of time. At every stage, the process was paused to ensure a question had been understood. If not, it was rephrased. Instructions were given in clear, straightforward language. “The normal recruitment process here takes about a week – a series of interviews, including one with HR, one with the technical team and another with a partner,” Chadha says. “This had to be slowed right down. Each interview had to be broken up into segments to give candidates enough time to absorb and reflect. The process of hiring took two months instead of a week.” EY changed its technical assessment. “Instead of determining what specific knowledge and skills [candidates] had, we switched to broadly discovering how strong their aptitude was for learning new things,” Chadha says.
Birla said he appreciated the extent to which the process had been customised. “It was supportive and patient. I felt EY understood my needs and heard my views as a neurodivergent person,” he says. According to the World Health Organization, one in 160 children globally have an autism spectrum disorder, and disproportionately high numbers of adults are unemployed. Action for Autism estimates that 18 million Indians are on the autistic spectrum, and jobs for this group are hard to come by. “The effort can collapse at the first hurdle – the interview. But we are working with some large companies and multinationals to encourage and support them in finding roles and we’re seeing progress,” says Preeti Siwach of Action for Autism. Pardeep Sharma, 25, lives in Delhi and used to visit the Action for Autism centre in Jasola, to learn soft skills. Siwach helped him to find work in housekeeping at a hotel chain before the pandemic struck. “He is a school leaver and I never expected him to get a job. If only more companies would realise that people with autism have something to offer. They can learn [and] they deserve an opportunity,” says his father, Sunil Sharma. Chadha says he has found that some of EY’s clients are intrigued by the new initiative. “Among our clients, in their own families they know of someone, a relative or a friend, with autism. They were keen to understand our policy and some have started replicating it,” he says.

2021-02-09T05:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,'I will never give up': Egypt's exiles still dream of democracy,"Ten years ago they were overthrowing Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak. Now they are in exile in Britain, under threat of imprisonment by the military regime. For Cairo’s revolutionaries, it has been a long journey of high hopes and broken dreams. “I was part of a historical moment,” says Sayed, 39. He was working in the Middle East in December 2010 when Mohamed Bouazizi, a street vendor in Tunisia, set himself on fire in a protest against his treatment by local officials. Fuelled by social media coverage, the incident sparked protests around the region, including in Egypt, where crowds flocked to Tahrir Square in Cairo demanding the overthrow of Mubarak. “Tunisia inspired us,” Sayed says. “I had a dream that we could change Egypt.” He returned home and took a leading role in the revolution. “It was the best decision I ever made.”
On 25 January 2011, after 18 days of protests, Mubarak stepped down. “It was a day of shock,” says Aly Khafagy, 37, a youth leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, the powerful political group that opposed the regime. “We shook Mubarak’s throne. We ended 30 years of corruption, injustice and constant fear.”
Hani Mahmud, 41, a political communications officer of former presidential candidate Abdel Moneam Aboel Fotouh, was on the streets in Cairo when the regime fell. “The 25th was a day filled with hope for all of us,” he says. “We would finally get social justice, democracy and positive change.” Those dreams were short lived. On 3 July 2013, the military launched a coup against the revolutionary government. Army chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Sisi removed the new president of Egypt, Mohamed Morsi, branded the revolution a conspiracy against the army and suspended the new constitution. Sisi launched a wave of repression and human rights violations against his political opponents. Egypt now has 60,000 political prisoners, mostly consisting of youth activists, politicians, journalists and doctors who opposed the regime. “We were naive,” Sayed says. “The counterrevolution defeated us. The regime destroyed my life in Egypt. They jailed, tortured and threatened me. They left me with no choice – just to flee my country.” He arrived in London in 2018 to seek asylum. Khafagy, who now lives in Manchester, was first targeted by the regime in 2013. He fled to the UK in 2019. “The Sisi government sentenced me to 50 years in absentia, froze all my assets and put my name on the criminal list,” he says.
Mahmud also claimed asylum in the UK and now lives in Scotland with his family. He considers himself fortunate to have made it out in time. “I’m lucky to be a refugee in the UK,” he says. “As far as I know, no one who believed in or participated in the revolution hasn’t been targeted by the Sisi regime. I have a lot of friends who were killed, jailed or exiled.”
Now, a decade after the overthrow of Mubarak, they lament the lost hopes of a democratic Egypt with a mixture of rage and disappointment. Mostly they agitate to get their allies out of jail. “I retired from politics,” Sayed says. “The only thing I can do now is campaign for our friends who are in prison.” Mahmud is determined to do something. “It is immoral to ignore all this pain,” he says, “to forget about our friend in jails or who have been killed and just keep going in our life.” Their feelings about their newfound home are mixed. All of them are grateful for the refugee status they have secured, but many are incensed that Britain maintains relations with the military regime in Egypt. “As long as powerful nations like America and Britain continue to associate with Sisi while ignoring his atrocities, dictatorships will continue to exist,” Mahmud says. “It’s shameful. The UK gave me protection against Sisi, but it continues to do business with him.” In so far as there is hope, it is for the future, and an expectation that the revolution will provide inspiration to the next generation of Egyptian activists. “I will never give up,” Khafagy says. “I will continue what we started in 2011. The factors that spurred the revolution 10 years ago continue to this day. Sooner or later Egyptians will take to the streets again demanding a better future.” Sayed agrees. “We did it once and we can do it again. Though the revolution failed, our generation left good lessons to the next generations.” This aspiration is the last flicker of the flames which once shook the Middle East and toppled one of the lengthiest dictatorships in the region. “The legacy of the revolution is the hope,” Mahmud says, “even with all our defeats.” * Some names have been changed to protect people’s identities"
2021-02-08T10:00:36Z,global-development,Global development,Covid deaths of Yanomami children fuel fears for Brazil's indigenous groups,"Ten Yanomami children died from Covid-19 in January, fueling fears over the disproportionate impact the coronavirus is having on vulnerable indigenous communities in the Brazilian Amazon. “It is very concerning that so many kids died in less than one month,” said Júnior Hekurari Yanomami, the head of Condisi-YY, an indigenous health council. The victims were diagnosed by a local health agent and cremated following the Yanomami tradition. They lived in the remote communities of Waphuta and Kataroa, near the Venezuelan border, which are only accessible by aeroplane. Public health specialists have warned that the coronavirus could wreak havoc on indigenous groups in a region where infectious diseases such as measles, smallpox and flu viruses have decimated such communities.
The Yanomami indigenous reserve is the size of Portugal, and a recent study showed it is particularly vulnerable to the spread of the virus, due to limited healthcare and difficult logistics. “Yanomami health has already collapsed, we have no support from the state,” Hekurari added. The young appear to be particularly vulnerable: of 32 Yanomami who had previously been confirmed or suspected Covid-19 deaths, seven victims were under the age of two. Four others were aged between 12 and 20, including a 15-year-old boy who became the first indigenous fatality in April. “Yanomami children are clearly more vulnerable to the virus, because many suffer from malnutrition and diseases like malaria, and some areas have no health workers,” said Maurício Ye’kwana, the director at the Hutukara Yanomami Association, speaking by Whatsapp from the community of Auaris. The virus has now reached all indigenous territories in Brazil and led to more than 47,000 cases and 900 deaths. At the Yanomami reserve, more than 1,600 people have tested positive, although anthropologist Ana Maria Machado, member of the Yanomami and Ye’kwana network, said that testing rates are very low: “We estimate more than 10,000 infections, considering they live in large collective houses, share utensils and have no access to alcohol cleaning solution or soap.” Other populations in the world have seen relatively few Covid-19 deaths among children compared with other age groups. But experts in Brazil believe that the virus has a much more aggressive impact on indigenous children. “The Covid mortality rate is much higher in indigenous under-fives than in the same age group in the general population,” said epidemiologist Andrey Cardoso, whose team at the government research institute Fiocruz will soon publish a study on the topic. In previous research, Cardoso found that indigenous children face poorer sanitary and health conditions, with a high prevalence of anaemia, malnutrition, diarrhoea, and short stature. The Amazon region is currently experiencing an alarming new surge in cases linked to a seemingly more contagious variant, that has pushed emergency services to their breaking point. “This second wave is more frightening as we know a mutation is already circulating in Roraima state,” said Ye’kwana. Brazil’s ministry of health said on Thursday it had sent a mission to investigate the cases in the Yanomami territory. But indigenous leaders and activists accuse the government of neglecting the 28,000 Yanomami and Ye’kwana people, who depend on fewer than 200 active health workers. They have also warned of the rise in wildcat goldminers taking the virus into isolated communities during the pandemic. The influx of illegal goldminers is a long-time trauma for the Yanomami. The gold rush that peaked in the late 1980s brought 40,000 garimpeiros, which caused violence, deforestation and outbreaks of infectious diseases. The incursions have increased again amid the systematic dismantling of environmental policies since Jair Bolsonaro took office in 2019. This week, Brazil’s president sent to congress a list of “priority bills”, including one aimed at opening indigenous territories to mining. According to data collected by Amazônia Minada, a project of InfoAmazonia, 142 applications for researching and mining inside the Yanomami reserve are active at Brazil’s mining agency."
2021-02-08T08:30:35Z,global-development,Global development,It's time for Africa to rein in Tanzania's anti-vaccine president | Vava Tampa,"What is wrong with President John Magufuli? Many people in and outside Tanzania are asking this question. Magufuli claimed last year that God had eliminated Covid in the east African country of 60 million people, and has since made dismissing Covid vaccines his central priority – leaving many people asking: why? In politics, there are generally two ways of making decisions. The first is evidence-based, weighing the pros and cons and choosing the best option; the greatest good for the greatest number. The other is a populist approach, hell-bent against facts, science and logic. In a global pandemic where more than 2 million people have died, that is catastrophic. The Tanzanian president seems to be taking populism to a whole new level. Maybe he is under the influence of the same rabid anti-lockdown social media messaging that has persuaded some of my family and friends that Bill Gates or 5G have created the virus. But regardless of Magufuli’s cavalier motivation, these stances are a danger to public health. People are being exposed to suffering, and in some cases death.
Although the virus’s effect on Africa – including the numbers hospitalised or being tested – has not been quantified, the grim facts are crystal clear from within Magufuli’s own circle. He knows Ghana’s former president, Jerry John Rawlings, has died from the virus. So too has former Congo-Brazzaville president Jacques Joaquim Yhombi-Opango. Last month four Zimbabwe cabinet ministers, including Sibusiso Moyo, the army general turned foreign minister who helped oust Robert Mugabe, died of Covid. In Malawi, four government officials, including two cabinet ministers, succumbed. In Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), the prime minister, Ambrose Dlamini, fell to the virus. Sudan’s last democratically elected prime minister, Sadiq al-Mahdi, has died, as has Libya’s former prime minister, Mahmoud Jibril, and Somalia’s former prime minister, Nur Hassan Hussein. In Burundi, Tanzania’s neighbour, two former presidents – Pierre Nkurunziza and Pierre Buyoya – have died from Covid-19. The African Union secured 270m doses of Covid vaccine for member states to supplement their efforts, highlighting the strong resurgence in cases and deaths that is sweeping through the continent. Yet Magufuli sticks bizarrely to asserting that Covid is a hoax. Instead of supporting lockdowns, and encouraging mask wearing as we prepare to mark the sombre anniversary of one year since the virus arrived in Africa, he has chosen to directly contradict local, regional and international efforts to defeat it. According to Magufuli, who ordered officials to stop reporting Covid cases last May, when there were 509 infections and 21 deaths, Tanzania is Covid-free; an alleged status the country shares with North Korea and Turkmenistan. In a bizarre scene last month, Magufuli praised China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, for not wearing a face mask during a visit to the country, as though this were a good thing. You really have to wonder, just what is wrong with Magufuli? In his crusade as an anti-vaxxer president, he has gone from repeatedly playing down the virus and mocking World Health Organization guidance to falsely claiming that Tanzania is Covid-free, and now to outrightly attacking his people for being vaccinated, fuelling denialism and conspiracies. For a continent already battered by health and social issues, including hunger, malaria, displacement, unemployment, violence and insecurity, Magufuli’s unconscionable stance should compel us all to act. Magufuli, who won another five-year term amid fraud allegations in 2020, is still fuelling anti-vaxxers as the pandemic and its new variants continue to play out. He needs to be challenged openly and directly. To look on indifferently exposes millions of people in Tanzania and across Africa’s great lakes region – as well as communities across the world – to this deadly and devastating virus. • Vava Tampa is a freelance writer, focusing on Africa’s great lakes, decolonisation and culture"
2021-02-08T06:45:32Z,global-development,Global development,'Fighting for life': Bangladesh shrimp farmers destitute in wake of cyclone,"This time last year the west coast of Bangladesh was a thriving place for shrimp farmers. It was a decent enough living and there was a healthy export market. Majnu Sardar, who lives in Koyra upazila (administrative region) in Khulna district, used to earn enough to feed, clothe and educate his family of six. Now they are living in a small mud hut, with a canopy of leaves as a roof, on the banks of the Kapotaksha River after Cyclone Amphan buried his house and land in May. “The shrimp farm was under water for nine months. Three to four feet of silt has accumulated there. Everything on the farm is ruined. Now a lot of money is needed to fix these again. I am now carrying the burden of debt. Where can I get money for shrimp farming?” Sardar, 35, and his family are “fighting” to eat. Every day he looks for labouring work. Up to 70% of the 300,000 shrimp farmers in Khulna and the neighbouring districts of Satkhira and Bagerhat ran small businesses, leasing land and selling for export, a trade that ended with the Covid-19 lockdown.
About 80% of export orders for shrimp, worth about $54m (£39m), were cancelled between July and December last year. The drop in exports saw local shrimp prices more than halve. That came just weeks after Amphan, the fiercest storm to hit the region this century, destroyed boats and equipment.
“This is causing a lot of trouble,” says Sardar. “Last year the Covid-19 virus and cyclone dropped me to zero. I have lost the capital for shrimp farming. I am carrying the burden of debt. I have become a day labourer from a shrimp farmer. I don’t know how it will go in the future.” Sardar is one of many still in temporary shelters, while others have upped and left for the capital Dhaka in search of work. Muslima Begum, 36, a shrimp farmer from Koyra upazila, used to earn a living wage, but now she is dependent on any work her husband, Mosharraf Hossain, can find. “We have never faced such a crisis before,” she says. “I’ve lost about 1 lakh taka (more than £800). I am in debt. Shrimp will not be cultivated this year. I don’t know how the day will go.
“It is now very difficult to provide food for five members of the family. Before, I got nutritious food from the vegetable garden near the house. Everything was destroyed in the cyclone, now everything has to be bought from the market. And [with] the high price of all products in the market, it is not possible for us to buy everything like before.” Nur Islam, 45, from Assasuni upazila, in Satkhira district, says his business is dead. “I have been making a living by shrimp farming for several years. There are small problems at different times. Losses occur when shrimp farms are infected with a virus. But if one year goes bad, the next year it makes up for the loss again,” he says.
“But this time I was completely finished.” Farmers have taken out loans or sold off their assets. Islam sold his cow to pay off his arrears to the landowner – and to buy a small boat that he uses to ferry people across the river. He earns up to 300 taka (£2.60) a day. His family of six now have only two meals a day. His daughter had to be taken out of school because Islam couldn’t afford the fees, and he’s had to stop sending his son money to help him through college. “I have never imagined that I would have to make a living by selling cows and buying boats.
“I am fighting for my daily life. I am in debt of about two lakh. I don’t know how to repay this loan. I can’t think of a new shrimp farm if I don’t repay the loan. In a few years we were going upwards economically. I’m going down very fast now.’’ Islam hopes the government will step in: “We cannot avoid natural disasters. I hope the good times for my shrimp will come when the epidemic is over … There needs to be government incentives for shrimp farmers to offset the losses. The government has to think of us.” Sign up for the Global Dispatch newsletter – a fortnightly roundup of our top stories, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues:

2021-02-07T12:00:10Z,global-development,Global development,‘It feels like a placebo’: Mexico’s vaccine program sees disastrous launch,"Rodolfo spent hour after aggravating hour trying to register his elderly mother for a Covid-19 vaccination through a Mexican government website, only for the system to crash repeatedly. “I spent three days fighting with the website,” he said. “My mom would have been unable to do it without me.” After the site launched on Tuesday, millions of Mexicans over 60 who tried to register were met by an error message for days on end. And even when the page loaded, other users reported further delays while a separate government agency checks official ID numbers, only to deliver a message of “No response”.
Many countries, including Canada and EU member states, have struggled to roll out their vaccine programmes but Mexico’s disastrous launch came at a particularly bad time. The country’s daily Covid-19 death toll averaged more than 1,000 during January, while hospital beds, oxygen tanks and intubation drugs were in short supply. The official death toll is now more than 163,000 – the third highest in the world. The crashing health secretariat website only fuelled the sense that the government’s response was awry. “It feels like a placebo,” Bárbara González, a political analyst, said after enrolling her parents for vaccinations. “It’s hard to believe things will start to get better when they have done such a poor job until now.” Human rights groups also raised concerns that many people, including migrants from other countries and internal migrants, do not have an official ID number. “Health is a human right that cannot be denied to anyone for any reason, including their nationality or immigration status,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. Mexico was the first country in Latin America to receive Covid-19 vaccines and started vaccinating health workers on 22 December. But the pace has slowed to just 4,365 doses a day, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker, and at the current pace, it would take a decade to vaccinate all Mexicans. Mexican health officials expect more doses of the Pfizer vaccine and 400,000 doses of the Sputnik V vaccine to start arriving later this month – quantities insufficient for the country’s 750,000 frontline health workers, according to the Associated Press. Health workers have complained that administrators have been vaccinated first. Questions have also been raised over vaccinating teachers in southern Campeche state – where infections are low – so classes can restart. Thousands of employees promoting government social programs known as “servants of the nation” are also being vaccinated ahead of their participation in vaccination campaigns, causing suspicions vaccinations would be used as a prop in campaigns for June’s midterm elections. “There’s no strategy,” said Xavier Tello, a healthcare analyst. “It’s been nothing but a series of random plans.” The website debacle coincided with an upbeat video from President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (commonly called “Amlo”) in which he said he had tested negative for coronavirus 12 days after contracting the disease. He voiced his usual upbeat message of hope and faith, along with promises to move past the worst of the pandemic. “We’re going to continue taking care of ourselves and having faith that we’re no longer going to get sick. And, most importantly, we’re going to save lives,” the president said. “This month, we’re going to massively vaccinate people, this month of February. The same in March and April,” he added. López Obrador is expected to return to work on Monday. His Thursday message spoke of solidarity – “The tragedy is making us more fraternal, more generous, more loving,” he said – though he has maintained his policies of tight-fisted austerity throughout the pandemic. In his message, López Obrador said: “We don’t have a consumer crisis,” but restaurant owners and employees begged to differ. They banged pots and pans outside their establishments on Thursday to demand a more robust government response and a lifting of restrictions on indoor dining. “It’s hard to sustain this,” said Abel Hernández, chef and owner of two Mexico City restaurants, Eloise and Lorreta. “It’s 11 months and we’ve had no support from the government.”"
2021-02-07T10:30:08Z,global-development,Global development,"More deaths, worse care? Inquiry opens into NHS maternity 'systemic racism'","An urgent inquiry to investigate how alleged systemic racism in the NHS manifests itself in maternity care will be launched on Tuesday with support from the UK charity Birthrights. The inquiry will apply a human- rights lens to examine how claimed racial injustice – from explicit racism to bias – is leading to poorer health outcomes in maternity care for ethnic minority groups. Data published last month by MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries across the country) showed black women were four times more likely than white women to die in pregnancy or childbirth in the UK while women from Asian ethnic backgrounds face twice the risk.
Barrister Shaheen Rahman QC, who will lead the inquiry, said: “In addition to these stark statistics there are concerns about higher rates of maternal illness, worse experiences of maternity care and the fact black and Asian pregnant women are far more likely to be admitted to hospital with Covid-19. “We want to understand the stories behind the statistics, to examine how people can be discriminated against due to their race and to identify ways this inequity can be redressed.” An expert panel that includes a human rights lawyer, a clinical negligence solicitor, doulas – trained healthcare companions – obstetricians and midwives will oversee the inquiry. Rahman will be supported by two co-chairs, including Benash Nazmeen, director of the Association of South Asian Midwives. “As a midwife and an aunt to 13, I have witnessed, heard and felt the discrimination faced by south Asian communities,” she said. “The repeated questions based on racial stereotypes, unsafe antenatal conversations due to cultural and communication barriers, and the appalling statistic that Pakistani women are more likely to have a premature baby or neonatal death in the UK compared to their country of origin – there are too many concerns that need to be unpicked and addressed.” Research published in 2013 found that women from minority ethnic groups had a poorer experience of maternity services than white women. They were more likely to deliver by emergency caesarean section, less likely to have pain relief during labour and received fewer home visits from midwives. The rates of baby loss are also higher for these groups, according to findings by MBRRACE-UK. Amy Gibbs, the Birthrights chief executive, said: “A lot of black and brown people in the birthing world are understandably frustrated by calls for more research when what’s needed is action. This inquiry will take the starting point that racism exists in our society so it must exist in the NHS.” Gibbs added: “We know many healthcare workers provide safe, respectful care to everyone, regardless of their ethnicity. But the evidence shows persistent inequities in maternity outcomes and experiences. We want to understand how racial bias and systemic racism impact on people’s basic rights in pregnancy and childbirth, so we can be honest about the harms being caused and what needs to change. The inquiry is particularly urgent in light of how existing inequalities have been exacerbated by Covid-19.” Black pregnant women are eight times more likely and Asian women four times more likely to be admitted to hospital with Covid-19 than white women. A new role of head of midwifery research has been created by NHS England to focus on health inequalities associated with maternity outcomes for mothers and babies from black, Asian and ethnic minority families. Prof Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, the chief midwifery officer for England, said: “Research is just one of the tools we will be using to improve maternity care for these mums and their babies.” She added: “Everyone working in maternity services wants all women to have the safest possible care, which is why as soon as evidence of heightened risks for pregnant women from black, Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds giving birth during the pandemic became clear, support for these women was boosted.” An initiative where women from these ethnic groups are seen by the same midwife and team throughout their pregnancy, birth and postnatal period to ensure continuity of care is being fast-tracked by the NHS. Case study: ‘The midwife was trying to gaslight me’ After going into labour with agonising contractions in March 2016, Sandra Igwe attended hospital and was sent home five times before finally being admitted. Previously, she had felt judged and experienced alleged racism during a pregnancy appointment, which led to a letter of apology from the hospital. But she says she was shocked that during childbirth and while feeling at her most vulnerable she would again face such treatment. “They would not believe I was in active labour,” she explained. “The midwife said my cries of pain did not coincide with my contractions and they withheld an epidural for hours on end. “The midwife was trying to gaslight me, it was horrific. They kept asking ‘why are you screaming?’ and said I was being ‘rude’.” She says it was only when her baby’s heart rate dropped and she was sick that she was taken seriously. The experience caused her to suffer postnatal depression which went undiagnosed. Feeling isolated after the birth of her daughter, she set up a social enterprise to amplify the voices of black mothers called the Motherhood Group which has gone on to support hundreds of women. Igwe, who will co-chair the inquiry, said: “Racism in maternity care in the UK is insidious and because it is covert and subtle it’s hard to describe how you are feeling. The strong black woman streotype is killing us. We should be allowed to be vulnerable and scream in pain.” She worries that too many mothers have postnatal depression which is going undiagnosed. “Black mothers do not trust the healthcare system and they are not seeking out support because when we do we are dismissed and ignored and the information we share is weaponised against us.”"
2021-02-05T08:30:13Z,global-development,Global development,How Covid could be the 'long overdue' shake-up needed by the aid sector,"This year one in every 33 people across the world will need humanitarian assistance. That is a rise of 40% from last year, according to the UN. More than half of the countries requiring aid to help deal with the coronavirus pandemic are already in protracted crises, coping with conflict or natural disasters. Even before Covid-19 threw decades of progress on extreme poverty, healthcare and education into reverse, aid budgets were heading in the wrong direction. In 2020, the UN had just 48% of its $38.5bn (£28bn) in funding appeals met, compared with 63% of $29bn sought in 2019. The UK’s cuts to aid alone, from 0.7% to 0.5% of gross national income, are projected by aid groups and MPs to result in 100,000 deaths, 1 million girls leaving school and 5.6 million children going unvaccinated. “Need is outstripping funding,” said Angus Urquhart, crisis and humanitarian lead at Development Initiatives. “We’re seeing a perfect storm gathering.” The pandemic was “increasing the demands made on governments and institutions while simultaneously eroding their capacity to respond to people in crisis”, he said. But with a knack for exposing weaknesses, coronavirus has also thrown the institutionalised shortcomings and inequalities of the aid system itself into sharp relief.
Development experts and critics who spoke to the Guardian called for a global reset of an aid industry they say is outdated and already facing pressure to reform. They want international charities and NGOs to root themselves in communities, to decentralise their western-centred power, and to trust and invest in the people they are supposed to help. One described the narrative where an aid donor is generous and the recipient needy as “unhelpful and inaccurate”. Last year was when “people realised we’re all connected”, said Jonathan Glennie, author of The Future of Aid: Global Public Investment. “With Black Lives Matter and decolonising aid, there’s a huge pressure on the sector to change. People are longing for a significant shift.”
Dividing countries into donors and recipients was “unhelpful and inaccurate” when poor countries are contributing heavily to sustainable development, he said. “The aid system is irrevocably old-fashioned … but it’s 2021.” Cash is still needed to tackle poverty, the climate crisis and Covid, and Glennie advocates a “global public investment (GPI)” fund paid into by all nations as a percentage of GDP, to be used for the “common good”. “There’s the whole south-south cooperation. Countries like Colombia are contributing and receiving global finance for development. Even Sierra Leone should give 0.7% of its GDP to global development. If that sounds radical, look at the list of countries contributing to the Global Fund, including Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe. Nigeria contributes to global peacekeepers. China and India give vast amounts. “We’ve set up a system where overseas development assistance is aid and there’s a group of 30 wealthy countries that give aid. But a lot of south-south cooperation is not money but time. Brazil’s health officials go to Mozambique. Cuba sends doctors all over the world. In the UK we would monetise that. But it’s called solidarity.” He added: “When we move away from donor-recipient language we will see a shift.” Sara Pantuliano, chief executive of the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), believes we are witnessing a “serious crisis of legitimacy” of aid structures. “What we are seeing is this dearth of cooperation. This is what the crisis has put into sharp relief. The need to work together has become more and more apparent. The myopia of governments that are not looking at working more closely together is showing,” she said. “This is the moment to reshape.” Citing coalitions pulling together after periods of crisis – the UN after the second world war, the G7 after the Gulf war and the G20 after the 2008 financial crash – she said: “Inevitably this will be a moment of rethinking of multilateralism and one that is long overdue.” “We will only get better once there is enough social pressure to change. We’ve seen social movement during the pandemic, around equality issues around racist issues.”
Gordon Brown, the former UK prime minister, who was at the heart of tackling the banking meltdown in 2008, has urged world leaders to create a temporary form of global government to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic fallout. And the current aid model means not enough money goes to local and national responders, said Harpinder Collacott, executive director of Development Initiatives. An international target set four years ago at the World Humanitarian Summit for 25% of aid to go to grassroots organisations by 2020 has failed, she said. “Our analysis shows about 2.1% of international aid goes to local NGOs,” said Collacott.
Jessica Neuwirth, co-founder of Equality Now and director of the women’s rights organisation Donor Direct Action (DDA), which links activists with funding and political power, said direct funding to local organisations is the exception rather than the rule. Analysis of OECD data by DDA found that of the billions in aid to civil society organisations working to ensure gender equality in the global south in 2018, only 8% went to groups that were based in developing countries. “A lot of international NGOs are taking a slice off the middle and giving a fraction to these frontline groups. But if you give directly to frontline groups you are giving them a chance to have their own ideas and a chance to get bigger.”
Neuwirth, who co-convened DDA with feminist Gloria Steinem and former UN high commissioner Navi Pillay, said: “Grassroots groups are a much more efficient and effective way to deal with development and a zillion other issues. They know what works and what doesn’t, they are committed to change in a way that outsiders are not and they are a lot cheaper.” International NGOs, even if they hire locally, often act as “implementing agencies” for their own agendas, she said. “There’s a trend for iNGOs to hire a national to run a country office. But that creates a domestic brain drain, because no one then wants to work for a local group for less money. And international NGOs act as an implementing agency for the donors. You don’t see the sort of change you get with local agencies.” Data analysed by ODI researchers published in November found “principled aid spending” was falling among 29 governments. The three key reasons for the trend were: the pandemic, the rift between China and the US which is “threatening global consensus building”, and “aid nationalism” which demands mutual benefits from aid. Neuwirth’s organisation is trying to change funding streams by linking donors with groups directly. It also encourages women leaders to speak up at the UN security council, to tell people: “You know what you are doing in my country it is not working and here’s why.” Muthoni Wanyeki, regional director for Africa at Open Society Foundations, said she has seen an impressive response to the pandemic from the African Union and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in planning mitigation and surveillance strategies as far back as January 2020, as well as from communities themselves. The effect of lockdowns, curfews and states of emergency was extreme, she said, but they produced an “amazing” response. “It impacted people’s livelihoods, their ability to move around, to get food to markets,” Wanyeki said. “But Africans responded. We saw incredible use of mobile money. Ordinary citizens setting up their own little cash transfer programmes, for poor families. There was one in Kenya, called Humanity Kenya, where one woman ended up supporting 4,000 families. You are not talking large amounts, but enough for people to get by. People respond to African influencers and money poured in from the diaspora.” The pandemic has prompted debate on the continent about the need for social protections, and more informed interest in healthcare, pension systems and money-saving loan schemes – called chamas or tontins in west Africa, where they are traditionally used by women for school fees or to absorb financial shocks. “There’s been a debate around how states recognise, support and even co-fund these groups,” she said. Simon O’Connell of SNV, a Dutch-based development group, and former executive director of Mercy Corps Europe, said the aid sector “needs to step up and do more with less. Overseas development budgets are declining and they have been for a long time.”
The pandemic has already forced restructuring. Oxfam International laid off 1,500 staff and closed operations in 18 countries last May, after a series of crises, including the Haiti sexual abuse scandal. A survey by Bond last October revealed that almost half of UK development organisations are expecting to shrink. “The reality is, international NGOs will be forced to collaborate and operate differently,” O’ Connell said. “Some will reduce their international footprint, some of them will look to operate in different ways, because they have no choice.” There were, he said, too many small- to medium-sized NGOs with similar aims operating across the same geographies. For example, there are about 100 NGOs in Sudan, and if each had its own country director, finance director and operations director, that would run to half a million dollars each, he said. “If donors are saying they are committed to localisation, and if we as a sector consolidate at an international level, then more money is freed up to go to local organisations.” “We need to stop focusing on our brands, our identities, on the winning of project funding and the delivery of projects, and shift on to the winning of bigger outcomes, to ensure no one slips further into extreme poverty.” Arbie Baguios, founder of Aid Re-imagined, said change to date had been too reliant on internal reformers in positions of power. What was required was a “shift in power and control” from international to local. “It’s hard for any organisation to give up power,” said Baguios. “The first step is to recognise this and talk about these issues. They should be asking: ‘What can my organisation, based in the global north, do to work with local actors to come up with their own solutions to their own problems?’” • This article was amended on 5 February 2021 to update the figure given in a quote about the percentage of international aid that goes to local NGOs. A previous version gave the 2018 figure; it has now been updated to show the 2019 figure."
2021-02-05T07:15:11Z,global-development,Global development,Four chicken heads a dollar:  how one Harare grandmother scratches a living in lockdown,"Pammula Chiunya, 68, is sitting under an open-sided shed outside a makeshift beer hall in Hopley settlement, six miles (10km) west of Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. She is not happy. Chiunya serves roasted chicken heads in a twist of old newspaper to a visibly drunk man, then settles to wait for someone else to emerge from the shebeen, which is crammed with animated revellers dancing to loud music. Customers are elusive, even with her prices: four heads for a dollar.
“On a very good day, I could make $2.50, but sometimes people do not have money to buy so I end up having chicken heads for dinner before they get bad,” says Chiunya. Zimbabwe may be in lockdown but shebeens in Hopley defy the ban on bars opening and sell beer alongside cheap but potent illicit alcohol, exacerbating the poverty in the households of the mostly jobless men who buy it. Their defiance is, however, a lifeline to Chiunya and her roasted chicken heads. Her customers are sometimes polite and sometimes rowdy: some eat her food and then refuse to pay. The beer hall is a difficult enough spot, but officers policing lockdown often raid her little stall and demand bribes, making it even more difficult to earn anything from her day’s work.
“The police are constantly raiding us and we pay bribes to continue working. I am left with nothing most of the times which means I must start over again. We do not dispute that Covid-19 is real but our livelihoods have been destroyed and we cannot recover. They should at least allow us to work because staying at home is not an option,” Chiunya says. Chiunya, a widow, looks after her five orphaned grandchildren. With so many mouths to feed, she has to work hard to provide for them all, and eats very little herself. “We eat porridge in the morning and sadza [maize meal] in the evening. This is all we can afford. It has never been a burden to take care of my grandchildren, but this time it has become very difficult,” she says.
“I am thinking of asking some of my relatives to take at least the two younger ones. It breaks my heart to hear them complain of hunger, yet I have nothing to give them.” Before the lockdown, Chiunya used to spend her days in central Harare, selling secondhand clothes, but all those stalls have been closed and cleared away. “Although things were tough, I could at least provide a decent meal for my grandchildren and send the three younger ones to school. If schools open now, I do not know if the children will be able to resume,” she says. Thousands of families live in squalor in Hopley, a settlement founded in 2005 after former president Robert Mugabe’s Murambatsvina – the notorious “Operation Clean-up” that pushed more than 300,000 of Harare’s poorest people out into the scrublands around the capital. To compound the poverty, Hopley does not have running water or a sewer system. Families survive on brick making or street vending, while some are tempted into petty crime, and girls as young as 14 have been abused in prostitution.
Those, such as Chiunya, who are finding it tough under lockdown have often sought help from local nongovernmental organisations that were providing small cash handouts. But much of the money has dried up. “There is a donor who has been gracious to families here, but I have never received any money,” says Chiunya. Outside her home, Natasha Tafirenyika, 18, a mother of two, is making a fire to cook the day’s single meal. Her two-year-old daughter has been crying for porridge, she says. Tafirenyika was recently laid off from her job as a house help. Her employers feared she would bring Covid-19 into their home. “I have nothing to support my two children, that job is all I had. At least I could give my mother some money to buy food here at home but all that is gone. Covid has taken away my livelihood,” she says, as she stoops to fan the flames.
“My hope is in God, we have no idea how we are going to survive another two weeks under lockdown, it is painful,” she says. A drive through Hopley and other areas around Harare reveals a picture of desperation, with people who were already on the margins having to defy lockdown to scratch a living. In Zimbabwe, the informal sector provides employment for 85% of the working population. People say that staying at home would mean starvation at a time when the country remains without a plausible plan for a vaccination scheme. Last week, Zimbawe’s vice-president, Constantino Chiwenga, extended the lockdown by another fortnight, after an initial 30-day period that included a dusk-to-dawn curfew.
Zimbabwe has been recording a growing number of Covid cases since the Christmas holidays owing, most believe, to unregulated movement of people in and out of the country. Last week, the country’s Covid-19 death toll breached 1,000 and several government ministers have died from the virus. There is widespread public panic about the country’s ability to deal with the pandemic. But for the poor, there is little choice when their livelihoods remain on the streets.

2021-02-05T02:35:25Z,global-development,Global development,'I have to do this to survive': a night with Jakarta's silvermen,"It was 8pm on one of the busiest intersections in western Jakarta. Three men in metallic paint from head to toe stood on the footpath. Each was holding a silver can. Alfan, 25, was one. When the light turned red, he walked in silence, barefoot, and stood in front of the stopped traffic. He bowed deeply for a few seconds and then struck a pose like a statue: standing straight, he raised his right hand to his temple and gave a salute in silence for about a minute without blinking.
At the end of his brief performance, Alfa gave another deep bow and approached the riders and drivers for a donation. “I’ll go home when I have got enough money. The other day I got 80,000 rupiah ($5.70) before 10pm, so I went home,” Alfan said after he returned back to the footpath. Alfan, who has two young children, is one of many cash-strapped Indonesians who have taken up the street art of manusia silver, or silvermen, to make ends meet during the pandemic. His work as a public minivan driver dried up when people were forced to stay at home when coronavirus hit last year. He shares a bottle of silver paint, which consists of cooking oil and glitter ink usually used for screen printing, with another hard-up driver. “It itches a lot. It hurts my skin. People also often asked whether we were drunk because our eyes would appear red, but we were not, it was the strong paint that irritated our eyes,” Alfan said.
Before the pandemic Alfan said he could earn 100,000-150,000 rupiah from his van, or angkot. But now it is difficult to find passengers and he can only get about Rp30,000 a day. “It’s not enough even to buy milk for my children. So I decided to drive in the morning and do this silver thing at night. It was embarrassing at first when I have to stand in front of everyone. But I don’t think I have a choice. “Until today I have never received any social assistance from the government. I have to do this to survive. We don’t do any crime; we are not forcing people to give us money. If they gave us money, thank God. But if not, then it’s OK,” Alfan said. The head of central Jakarta’s social affairs agency, Ngapuli Peranginangin, said the appearance of the “silver humans” was one of the most noticeable features of the pandemic. As the outbreak disrupted business activity in Indonesia, 2.67 million people have lost their jobs, according to Statistics Indonesia (BPS), bringing the unemployment rate to 7.07% in August 2020, the highest level since 2011.
Meanwhile, about 1.63 million Indonesians fell into poverty in March 2020, raising the official rate to 9.78% or 26.4 million people. “These manusia silver started to appear on the streets after the pandemic. We have never seen them before this,” Ngapuli told the Guardian, before adding that the numbers had started to decrease after police launched raids to “put everything in order”. Across the road from where Alfan stood, Desi, 25, took a brief rest, sitting under a tree on the footpath. Her body and her long ponytail were also covered in silver paint. Her husband, who is an angkot driver, worked in the morning, and at night she would try to earn money as manusia silver. “I worked in a store last year, but after the large-scale restrictions the store owner decided to send some staff, including me, home because he can’t pay us any more. I try to find jobs here and there, but every store is suffering from the pandemic so they don’t have jobs for me,” Desi said.
“I come here at around 6pm every day to avoid the police raids because they usually happen during daytime,” she added. Desi said she understood the dangers posed by the chemicals in the paint but said she had no choice. “I got rashes on my body. I have to take a bath twice, first with dish soap, because that’s the only way I can remove the paint, and then finally with the body soap,” she said. “It might have affected my health but we need the money. We have two children at home; the first one is only three years old, the second one is only three months old. I have to remember them.” Ngapuli said his agency had also often found children performing as silver humans on the streets. He said these children acted on their own, simply to seek pocket money.
However, the secretary general of the Indonesian Women’s Coalition (KPI), Mike Verawati, said the children who join the silver people must have been organised by adults. “This is child exploitation,” Verawati said. “The government must work with community groups to make programs for the young children so they can still learn and stay active during the pandemic, even though they cannot go to school,” she said. “The government must interfere in this situation so these children will not return to the streets.”"
2021-02-04T18:06:14Z,global-development,Global development,Myanmar coup: army blocks Facebook access as civil disobedience grows,"Myanmar’s army has ordered internet service providers to block access to Facebook as it attempts to stamp out signs of dissent, days after it ousted the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Facebook, one of the most popular means of communication in Myanmar, has been used to coordinate a civil disobedience campaign that saw health workers at dozens of hospitals walk out of their jobs on Wednesday to protest against the army’s actions. It has also been used to share plans for evening protests, where residents have taken to their balconies to bang pots and pans, a symbolic act to drive away evil.
The ministry of communications and information said Facebook, used by half of Myanmar’s 53 million people, would be blocked until Sunday, adding that people were “troubling the country’s stability” by using the network to spread “fake news and misinformation”. Facebook confirmed that it was aware of the disruption, while NetBlocks, which monitors internet outages around the world, said service providers in Myanmar were also blocking or restricting access to Instagram and WhatsApp, which are both owned by Facebook. Reuters reported that the attempts to block Facebook had had mixed success, however, and that some people were still able to access the sites. Demand for virtual private networks surged by 4,300%, according to Top10VPN.com, as people sought to circumvent the ban. The military later announced it would also block VPN servers. Despite the army’s attempt to silence online activism, and its grim record of using violence against demonstrators, small impromptu protests began to form on Thursday. The first street protest against the coup took place in the city of Mandalay, where a small group chanted: “Our arrested leaders, release now, release now.” The group was quickly chased away by riot police, the news site Myanmar Now reported. Four people were reportedly arrested. Sporadic protests also took place in Yangoon. At Sule Pagoda, activists released a stream of red balloons, the colour associated with Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, from the back of a truck, while elsewhere a small crowd of protesters were cheered as they shouted, “Let the junta fall.” They raised their hands in a three-finger salute, the gesture used by Thai pro-democracy activists, before running off into the crowds to evade the police. At 5pm across the city, cars beeped their horns and crowds clapped to show their opposition to the military. Aung San Suu Kyi, who was detained during a raid on Monday morning, was charged on Wednesday with possession of illegally imported walkie-talkies, which could carry a two-year prison sentence. She has not been seen publicly since her arrest. Messages shared on Facebook prior to the evening protests this week told people to take to their balconies and shout: “We pray that Aung San Suu Kyi is healthy”, “We pray that Myanmar will receive freedom” and “We pray that the military control will end.”
At least 147 people have been detained since the coup on Monday, including activists, lawmakers and officials from the ousted government of Aung San Suu Kyi, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. The UN security council issued a consensus statement on Thursday expressing “deep concern” over the one-year state of emergency and calling for the immediate release of detainees. But Thursday’s statement stopped short of condemning the army’s actions and did not use the word “coup” after China and Russia asked for more time to finesse the response. “It is better a text with less than no text at all,” one diplomat told AFP. The military has justified its takeover by accusing Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) of fraud in November’s election, a claim that has been dismissed by observers. The party secured an overwhelming 396 out of 476 seats in the recent vote – an even stronger majority than in 2015, when Aung San Suu Kyi was swept to power on a wave of optimism as the country held its first open elections in decades. On Thursday, dozens of MPs from the NLD signed a “pledge to serve the public” and held their own symbolic parliamentary session in Naypyidaw in defiance of the military. The coup happened just a decade after the military – which ruled Myanmar for 50 years – agreed to share power with civilian leaders. “We will do everything we can to mobilise all the key actors and international community to put enough pressure on Myanmar to make sure that this coup fails,” António Guterres, the UN secretary general, told the Washington Post on Wednesday. “It is absolutely unacceptable after elections – elections that I believe took place normally – and after a large period of transition.” When asked about the indictment of Aung San Suu Kyi, 75, Guterres said: “If we can accuse her of something, [it] is that she was too close to the military, [it] is that she protected too much the military.” Though Aung San Suu Kyi is revered at home, her international reputation has been severely undermined by her decision to defend Myanmar against allegations of genocide. “I hope that democracy will be able to make progress again in Myanmar, but for that, all the prisoners must be released, the constitutional order must be reestablished,” Guterres said. Myanmar’s army has claimed tthat he coup is in line with the country’s constitution. The army chief, Min Aung Hlaing, now head of a new cabinet, on Tuesday defended the military’s action as “inevitable”. Civilian leaders, he said, had not listened to the army’s complaints of voter fraud."
2021-02-04T12:57:12Z,global-development,Global development,African nations fear more Covid deaths before vaccination begins,"Communities across Africa are reeling as a second wave of Covid infections recedes, leaving thousands dead amid fears of further surges before mass vaccination campaigns can begin to make a difference. Few countries in Africa will start immunising even frontline health workers until much later this year, prompting accusations that large orders by wealthy nations are costing the lives of medical staff in poorer parts of the world. “We haven’t started because we didn’t have the vaccines … some countries placed very important premarket commitments that made it difficult for vaccines to be available in Africa,” said Dr John Nkengasong, director of African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), on Thursday. Campaign groups are calling for Covid-19 vaccines to be prioritised for frontline health workers and people at highest risk of severe illness and death from Covid-19 everywhere in the world.
“It would be indefensible if some countries started to vaccinate their lower-risk citizens while many countries in Africa are still waiting to vaccinate their very first frontline health workers,” said Christine Jamet, director of operations for the medical organisation Médecins Sans Frontières. “This is a global pandemic that requires a global spirit of solidarity if we truly hope to bring it under control.” There is growing evidence that the 3.6m cases and 93,000 deaths from Covid-19 in Africa counted by the CDC may be a significant underestimate, deepening concerns that tens of thousands could die in the coming months if enough vaccines are not made available. The most recent rise in infections began in December, fuelled by more contagious variants of the Covid-19 virus, including one that emerged in South Africa, increased movement and “prevention fatigue”, officials said. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization regional director for Africa, told reporters last week that the continent was “at a crossroads”.
Health systems across the continent have been overwhelmed since December as the second wave pushed daily recorded infections above 30,000. Oxygen has been in short supply, workers exhausted, and crematoria unable to meet demand. There have been acute shortages of beds in even relatively wealthy countries and high-profile casualties. Only six countries in Africa have now received relatively small quantities of vaccine, although 41 countries were hit by the second wave. South Africa, which accounts for more than half the cases and deaths in sub-Saharan Africa, will start to vaccinate health workers later this month with 1m Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines recently received from Indian production lines. The health minister, Zweli Mkhize, has said he aims to “get to herd immunity by the end of the year”. Even before the second wave, Covid killed more than 300 health workers in South Africa’s stretched public health care system, with more than a third of deaths in the badly hit province of KwaZulu-Natal. “It’s a huge tragedy. It’s a very long list and we already have such a shortage of skilled people that we cannot afford to lose anyone,” said Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association.
In Sudan, 41 doctors died from Covid-19 between March and January, medical associations said. Dr Ibrahim Fahal,president of the UK-based Sudan Medical Care Foundation, said frontline medical staff in Sudan faced acute shortages of PPE, limited safety measures and very large numbers of patients. “They are very exposed. A way to get them vaccines has to be found and as soon as possible.” High numbers of casualties among health workers have also been reported in Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Kenya, where 30 doctors had died by November. They included Stephen Mogusu, who was employed on a temporary contract and was never paid for the five months he worked in a Covid-19 ward at a public hospital in the town of Machakos. He left a wife and a five-month-old daughter. Nigeria was spared the worst in its first Covid-19 wave that began in February last year. But more than half of Nigeria’s 131,242 confirmed cases have been logged in the past three months. Fatalities now total 1,586. Enema Amodu, the chairman of the Nigeria Medical Association, said at least 20 doctors died there in a single week in December after getting coronavirus.
In Malawi, new cases increased exponentially in January, doubling every four to five days, and nine frontline health workers have died after testing positive for Covid-19. “The priority now is protecting frontline health workers,” said Marion Péchayre, MSF’s head of mission in Lilongwe. “If Malawi had 40,000 doses of vaccine, we could at least start by vaccinating health staff in the country’s main hotspots. Without this, the situation will soon be untenable.” Though African Union has announced it had secured 670m doses for its 54 member countries, only 50m are likely to be available before June and the winter in the southern parts of the continent. The Covax programme, a global initiative backed by the WHO which aims to cover about 20% of the populations of developing nations, said on Wednesday it aimed to distribute up 600m doses in the first half of 2021, with countries receiving amounts in proportion to their population size. It is estimated Africa will need 1.5bn vaccine doses to immunise 60% of its 1.3bn inhabitants, costing between $7bn and $10bn. The CDC said this will take two years, depending on the efficacy of the doctrine and the speed of roll-out.
Nkengasong said that although the vaccine situation was improving, the case fatality rate in Africa was now 2.6%, above the global average of 2.2% and “very troubling”. He said: “To win the war against this disease we need to vaccinate quick.” South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, criticised “vaccine nationalism” last week and accused rich countries of bulk-buying coronavirus vaccines and hoarding them to the detriment of others. “We need those who have hoarded the vaccines to release them … we are not all safe if some countries are vaccinating and others are not,” said Ramaphosa, who currently chairs the AU.
Campaigners are calling for a waiver of patents on vaccines to allow greater and more rapid supply. Experts say this would be particularly important for Africa if massive and continuing campaigns of vaccination are necessary to boost immunity. Tanzania has rejected vaccinations altogether, raising fears that the east African country could act as a reservoir for the disease and threaten progress elsewhere. President John Magufuli said last week that Tanzania had “lived for over one year without the virus because our God is able and Satan will always fail” and insisted the pandemic can be fought with herbal remedies. The World Health Organization’s Africa chief last week urged Tanzania to share its data on infections, while Nkengasong said “to get this [disease] out of our continent … we need to rally around unity.” In South Africa, the country with the most reliable statistics, excess mortality figures suggest the true death toll from the disease may be as much as three times the official total of 44,000. The most recent statistics show more than 50,000 excess deaths in the four weeks from 27 December. One study by the LSE found that an estimated 2% of Covid-19 deaths have been reported in Khartoum, Sudan, with about 16,090 deaths possibly missed in the period before 20 November last year. Another study in Zambia found about one in six bodies brought to the capital Lusaka’s main mortuary last summer tested positive for the coronavirus, only a fraction had been recorded as deaths due to the disease."
2021-02-04T10:30:31Z,global-development,Global development,Class cancelled: how Covid school closures blocked routes out of poverty,"In the coffee-farming communities of the Peruvian Amazon, the classroom is a route out of poverty. Gabriela was studying civil engineering in a city an hour and a half from home when the Covid-19 pandemic struck. The 18-year-old, who is one of thousands of young people tracked since 2002 as part of the Young Lives project led by the University of Oxford, has been forced to postpone her education, in a country where 16% of 19-year-olds have dropped out of education because of the crisis. It is not only Peru – one of the success stories of the past two decades in reducing poverty and raising living standards – where this is an issue. Gabriela is one of millions of young people across the globe undergoing similar experiences because of Covid-19. The Malala Fund, which advocates for girls’ education, estimates, using models from the 2014 Ebola crisis in west Africa, that 20 million more girls could be out of school after the coronavirus pandemic. A study of students the Young Lives project has been following in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam, published in January, paints a devastating picture of the economic and social impact of Covid-19 on young lives.
Their experiences raise fears that lockdowns and restrictions not only threaten to halt progress made over the past two generations, but could also reverse life chances and entrench inequalities for many young people, hitting those living in poor communities hardest. Gabriela’s story is typical of many who have been forced, at all ages, to halt their education by the crisis. As a child, she helped out at home, carrying water and firewood with her mother and looking after her younger brothers and sisters. When she was nine her mother died, leaving her and her siblings to be cared for by their father and elder sister. Further adversity struck in 2014, when the coffee crop failed and her father fell into debt.
She worked throughout her time at school, supported by her elder sister after her father died two years ago, and also worked on the farm during her holidays. “My sister, with what was left [from the harvest profit] supported me with my studies. My father had his orchard and livestock. By selling [farm products] my sister supported me.” “My father’s passing wasn’t a setback for me. As the saying goes: you have to finish what they start.”
The actual setback turned out to be a global pandemic. “No one thought this pandemic would be a long-term issue. I wanted to intern in the morning and study at night. I thought this could be done, but with this pandemic it couldn’t.” While Gabriela did try to continue with her studies remotely as one of only five in her class of 20 who enrolled in April, like many, she faced severe challenges because of unreliable internet connections and having to share one computer with her siblings – a digital divide that has been experienced sharply across the globe. “My brother and I had lessons scheduled at the same time. The first to enter rationed their time to give to the next. Sometimes he started and I lost my lesson, and sometimes the other way around.” In the end, economic reality intruded. “In my town the harvest has finished. Being there without a job, without income, one cannot fool around. The need is big, I had to look for money. I as a big girl also have to support my younger siblings who are still there.’’ With an uncertain economic future, she may need to continue to work to support her family and may not be able to finish her professional degree if face-to-face lessons don’t resume. “It would make me feel bad, because it would change my plans once again.’’
“Education plays a big role in helping people escape poverty. And that has been hit hard by the pandemic,” says Marta Favara, an economist and lead investigator with Young Lives. “In the two cohorts we have been following, we were seeing people beginning to transition to higher education. Now we’re seeing them drop out of education as households face the economic crises caused by the pandemic. “That includes increased food prices and health expenses and a decrease in income, as a lot of people have lost their jobs. Instead, we are seeing young people being pushed back to agriculture.”
For girls, says Favara, the economic risks of dropping out of education are higher, as they also often face pressure to start families. Research suggests leaving school earlier will mean they have less education and fewer opportunities. All of which has reversed progress that the project had been tracking in nutrition, education and sanitation over the past two decades. Especially concerning is the impact of the digital divide in many of the countries the project covers. This has amplified the problems in education seen around the world during the coronavirus crisis. “The issue of the digital divide is huge. In some places only 5% have access to the internet. Then there is the question of what is happening to the mental health of these young people,” says Favara. For Gabriela, like so many others, it is now just a question of waiting. “We have to wait till it gets back to normal,” she says. “The old fashioned way. We’re going to have to start from scratch. Because sometimes one makes plans, but God has others.” Sign up for the Global Dispatch newsletter – a fortnightly roundup of our top stories, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues:"
2021-02-04T06:20:59Z,global-development,Global development,'Back empty-handed': Bangladeshis cut off from jobs abroad face rising poverty,"When the pandemic forced Firoza Begum back to Bangladesh after six months trapped in her employer’s house without pay, her husband was so angry she had returned empty-handed that he would not let her move back in to the family home. All her savings after 14 years working in the Middle East had been spent escaping her abusive employer. Begum, 40, had to go to her parents’ home, where she took on responsibility for her mother and two disabled sisters. For years, Bangladeshi migrant workers have supported their families back home and their remittances have been vital to keeping entire communities out of extreme poverty, as the government has tried to meet the UN’s 2030 sustainable development goals. But after hundreds of thousands of migrant workers lost their jobs because of Covid-19’s economic impact, government research suggests that they and their families are returning to the poverty they tried to escape. A year ago, Begum was earning 22,000 Bangladeshi taka (£190) each month working for a Saudi doctor, sending almost all of it to her husband or her parents, to repair houses, buy land and pay medical bills. “Now there is no income. I am having a hard time meeting our family’s monthly expenses,” she says. “We’re surviving by taking loans from my relatives. I owe them about 150,000 taka. I don’t know how this money will be repaid.”
The government has encouraged work abroad. Remittances were worth $15bn (£11bn) a year and helped reduce poverty in rural areas, supporting families and financing small business. By last April however, remittances were at their lowest for a decade, according to the central bank, and the protracted crisis is pushing back Bangladesh’s progress on poverty. The World Food Programme has estimated that, globally, the drop in migrant workers’ remittances could put an additional 33 million people at risk of hunger.
When the government reported to the UN on its progress against the sustainable development goals in June, it said that the poverty rate had halved from 40% in 2005 to 20.5% in 2019, but that the pandemic risked halting the main strategies of promoting work abroad and increasing employment opportunities for the poorest. By June 2020, the poverty rate had risen back to 29.5%. A survey by Bangladeshi research company Innovision said on average low-income families had enough to support themselves for eight days without extra income, while most households had grain stores that would last 11 days.
Brac, Bangladesh’s largest NGO, created a database of 35,000 returnees to support them with cash grants and counselling. Shariful Islam, head of Brac’s migration programme, says there have been more than 400,000 returnees since early 2020 and most had no support. “People are coming back empty-handed who have lost their jobs. These people don’t know what will happen in the future.” Given how many people are supported by each migrant worker, he says, up to a third of the population could be affected by the job losses, and there are still many unemployed people stranded abroad. A survey in June by the UN’s migration agency (IOM) revealed that most of the returnees were now unemployed and half had no income at all.
In Paschim Charbata, a village in the coastal Noakhali district, almost every home had sent a man abroad over the past decade but most are now back. They sit at home worrying about jobs, mounting debt and feeding their families. “The coronavirus pandemic has stopped my life. My life trajectory was at its peak but now it’s rapidly descending. The family was doing quite well. I could spend the money on what my family needed. Now it is very difficult to meet the daily expenses,” says Reaz Mahmud, 39. He has accumulated a debt of 600,000 taka (£5,200) – double the amount he borrowed when he first left Bangladesh in 2010 to work as an electrician in Qatar. His job as a private driver in Oman ended when the pandemic led to travel restrictions, trapping him in Bangladesh, where he had been taking a holiday for the first time in two years. Rezaul Karim Chowdhury, head of Bangladeshi NGO Coast, says the organisation will make migrant workers a priority by supporting them to reintegrate into society, or providing training so they can return to work abroad with better skills. “There are hardships because they are running out of savings, they are not in good condition and sometimes they are suffering trauma. If it continues it will create social unrest, so we are ready to support them,” says Chowdhury. Mahmud had to send his wife to her father’s house with their three children and sell most of his land. With so many people searching for jobs, finding work has proved impossible and he now faces selling the plot his family live on unless he can return to Oman. “Before the pandemic I was able to send money home every month and, from abroad, alleviated many of the crises at home. I thought I could make a living through this job, that I could improve my life,” says Mahmud. “Coronavirus shattered all dreams.” Sign up for the Global Dispatch newsletter – a fortnightly roundup of our top stories, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues:"
2021-02-03T19:55:04Z,global-development,Global development,Canada takes Covid vaccines from Covax program despite side deals,"Canada is set to receive a significant haul of vaccines over the next months through a platform designed to maximise supply to poor countries, according to a new forecast, despite reserving the most doses-per-person in the world through direct deals with pharmaceutical companies. Chile and New Zealand, which have also made controversial side deals to secure their own vaccine supplies, will also receive hundreds of thousands of doses, according to the interim allocation schedule released by Covax on Wednesday. Covax, a mechanism to distribute Covid-19 doses fairly around the world, aims to deliver about 330m doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines to 145 countries by June, volumes that it says will be enough to cover an average of 3.3% of each country’s population. Canada is entitled to receive shots under the Covax scheme, in which advance purchases by wealthy nations are used to underwrite vaccine development and subsidise doses for poorer countries. It has contributed about $345m, half of which was to pay for its own doses. But Ottawa has also led the world in direct deals with pharmaceutical companies to secure its own supply, reserving enough to cover approximately 9.6 doses per person, according to Guardian analysis. Global health authorities have criticised countries for making private deals that they say push up vaccine prices and represent a form of “double-dipping” – taking supplies from Covax while at the same time signing private deals that make it harder for the facility to secure doses that would be shared equitably. Other countries that have reserved significant supplies through side deals with pharmaceutical companies, including Australia, Israel and the UK, did not elect to receive or were not allocated any vaccine from the first batch of allocations announced on Wednesday. Canada opted to receive 1,903,200 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine through Covax, representing about 2.5% of its population.
Some of the vaccine doses that Canada has reserved in private deals come from candidates that are still in development, and may not be approved. But taking into account just those that have released phase 3 results, Canada still has enough reserved to vaccinate its population at least four times over. Chile and New Zealand, who have also made extensive private deals, were also both scheduled to receive enough vaccine through Covax over the next months to cover more than 5% of their people, the data showed. In contrast, many of the countries that were allocated Covid-19 vaccine doses on Wednesday’s list have made no direct supply deals and have no other source of vaccinations but Covax. On Wednesday, the chief executive of Gavi, one of the organisations that is helping to administer Covax, was asked if it was helpful that many wealthy countries did not opt to take vaccines from the first batch that will be distributed. “Of course it helps,” Seth Berkley, Gavi CEO, said. “That means there are more doses available for others.” The supply through Covax – which is not final and subject to manufacturing and logistical delays – represents a boost to the six million doses Canada was already expecting from Pfizer and Moderna before the end of March. Despite reserving large supplies, Canada has struggled to get its vaccination program off the ground. Unlike other rich countries, it does not have fully developed domestic production capacity and is reliant on shipments from abroad. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has said the country will vaccinate its population by September, but has so far managed to reach just 2.5% of people, raising doubts it will reach its target before 2022. “Compared to other OECD countries, Canada is way down to the bottom of the pack in terms of vaccinations per hundred thousand,” said Ronald Labonté, former Canada research chair in globalisation and health equity at the University of Ottawa. “Would I criticise Canada for having engaged in vaccine nationalism at the outset? Yes, but I would also do that with all of the countries that have since followed suit … We’ve moved from vaccine nationalism to a vaccine race.” Research released last week predicted that most low-income countries would not have sufficient vaccine supplies until at least 2024, by which time most rich and middle-income countries may have achieved close to full vaccination. The delay will slow the global economic recovery from the crisis and increase the chance of new variants emerging that overcome immunity induced by vaccines. Frederik Kristensen, the deputy CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which also runs Covax, said the announcement of the first allocations on Wednesday was a “a critical moment”. “We are on the path to really start balancing out a global map which so far has so far shown how many low-income countries are yet to start vaccinating a single person while other wealthy countries go ahead towards mass vaccination,” he said. Against a tide of nationalistic responses to the pandemic, Covax has successfully rallied billions of dollars in contributions, and says it is on track to deliver more than 2bn vaccine doses this year, enough to inoculate more than 20% of the populations of its 190 member countries. But the figure is thought to be an optimistic estimate, with those involved in the facility making clear that unforeseen interruptions to supply are likely, and that the full quantity of doses may take longer than scheduled to arrive. • This article was amended on 5 February 2021. An earlier version said that Canada would receive 1,903,200 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, representing about 5% of the country’s population. This has been corrected to 2.5%, as two doses are required."
2021-02-03T16:39:18Z,global-development,Global development,"Colombia's ex-guerrillas: isolated, abandoned and living in fear","Daniela Márquez, 30, bears the scars of Colombia’s long civil war on her body. Until three years ago, she was a medic with what was then South America’s most powerful guerrilla army: the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). Five years ago, while her commanders were suing for peace, an airstrike killed seven of her comrades and hurled pieces of shrapnel into her arms, legs and back. Despite the hatred she felt for the government, she supported a peace deal signed in 2016 that formally ended five decades of war that killed more than 260,000 and forced 7 million from their homes. “The government never stopped being an enemy,” she said. “But living in fear of another airstrike became unbearable.” For the past four years, Márquez and her young children have lived in a remote demobilization camp of rough shacks nestled in the rainy mountains of the Cordillera Central, where she is raising her young children, aged one and three. But Márquez and many former fighters say that the bet that they made on peace has not yet paid off – and that the government has done little to protect them from those that still want them dead.
Since the peace deal was signed, 254 ex-Farc members have been murdered across the country, and while the apparent motives for their killings vary, those responsible – either the gunmen or those who order the deaths – rarely face justice. The brazen string of killings has caused some demobilized fighters to wonder if Colombia will ever know peace. “War is war, it never ends,” said Márquez. “The same as always, we’re waiting for the roof above our heads to fall in.”
The peace deal won a Nobel peace prize for Juan Manuel Santos, the president who negotiated it, but in Colombia it remains divisive. Many Colombians still view the accord – with its guarantees of soft sentencing in exchange for testifying at a special peace tribunal – as too soft on rebels who kidnapped thousands of civilians, ambushed soldiers and became major players in the country’s drug trade. After the deal, the former rebels formed a political party, whose name – the Common Alternative Revolutionary Force – maintained the armed group’s Spanish initials. In January they rebranded as “the Commons”, a name less redolent of decades of war. Days later, the special peace tribunal charged eight rebel leaders with kidnapping.
Though still controversial, the hearings are the first chance for many of the war’s victims to have their day in court. But as the process of justice and reconciliation plays out in Bogotá courtrooms, former rebels accuse the current president, Iván Duque of deliberately slow-walking the implementation of other parts of the peace deal. In early November, hundreds of former fighters from the Farc marched to Bogotá, the capital, demanding work opportunities and better protection. Duque promised to improve housing and security, but laid the blame for the violence at the feet of dissident Farc fighters who have returned to arms. In Carrizal, conditions are worsening. Shacks are falling apart, the roads and pathways torn up, and residents’ only way to communicate with the outside world is a public wifi with intermittent service. A few commercial projects, such as pineapple crops and beekeeping, have proven unproductive as the camp is so far from markets. Meanwhile, fighting continues nearby. The region, which straddles some of Colombia’s most productive goldmines, is rife with armed groups: another rebel group, the National Liberation Army (ELN), continues to battle the army, who are stationed across the valley. The Gaitanist Self-Defence forces of Colombia (AGC) and the Caparrapos – two drug-trafficking gangs with origins in the paramilitary militias which battled the Farc – have also been expanding their presence, as have dissident Farc factions.
At night, the sound of gunfire often drowns out the croaking of frogs and chirping of crickets. “Like a fish underwater that will suddenly leap above the surface, fighting can break out at any time,” said Wilmer Perdonimo, 57, who spent 35 years with the rebels and now tends a smallholding attached to the camp. “We live between fear and hope.” When rain is torrential, as it often is this time of year, the trail into the camp is a muddy bog. There is no phone reception, no hookup to the electrical grid and no reliable running water. Former rebels are still living in the temporary shelters they hastily put up nearly four years ago. The coronavirus pandemic has not yet reached their camp, though outbreaks of tropical diseases like dengue and yellow fever are not uncommon. Nevertheless, some ex-rebels say the rough conditions are a small price to pay for peace. “The road to peace is torturous and very rocky,” said Teo Panclasta, a former fighter with political aspirations. “But that’s where we’re going.”
In the nearby village of Carrizal, houses and shops are daubed with ELN graffiti, and it is clear how rebel groups are able to win support in isolated towns with few jobs and no health centre, school or police. “When you see how abandoned we are here, you understand why armed groups are able to become the authorities,” said a civilian community leader, who preferred not to give her name for fear of reprisal. “No one expects the government to do anything.” Some analysts warn that former guerrillas may see history repeating itself. After a previous attempt to make peace in the late 1980s, thousands of members of the Patriotic Union, a previous Farc political party, were murdered by paramilitary groups often working with the military. “We’ve seen this script before within just a generation, and if these guerrillas think it is happening again, they’ll take up weapons again,” said Adam Isacson, a Colombia expert at the Washington Office on Latin America thinktank. “They’ll see no other choice.”"
2021-02-03T16:14:38Z,global-development,Global development,Aung San Suu Kyi could face two years in jail over ‘illegal’ walkie-talkies,"Myanmar police have charged ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi with possession of illegally imported walkie-talkies, which could result in a two-year prison sentence, as a civil disobedience campaign grew against the military’s coup. A document from a police station in the capital, Naypyitaw, said military officers who searched Aung San Suu Kyi’s residence had found handheld radios that were imported illegally and used without permission by her bodyguards. The charges, confirmed by members of her party, appear to carry a maximum prison sentence of two years. A state newspaper also reported that the new military government would investigate what it has described as fraud in November’s election, in which its proxy party was heavily defeated by Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD).
The ousted president, Win Myint, is meanwhile to be charged for allegedly breaching coronavirus laws by meeting people on the campaign trail. The moves are likely to fuel already simmering anger towards the military. In one of the first organised acts of defiance against the army since Monday’s coup, health workers in 70 hospitals and medical departments in Naypyidaw, Yangon and other towns and cities said they would not work under the military regime, accusing the generals of placing their own priorities above those of ordinary people during the pandemic. “We refuse to obey any order from the illegitimate military regime who demonstrated they do not have any regards for our poor patients,” the organisers said.
Teachers’ groups, including the Myanmar Teachers’ Federation, announced they would join the civil disobedience campaign, while a Facebook page that was set up to coordinate such action accumulated more than 180,000 followers by Wednesday evening. The All Burma Federation of Students Union has urged other government workers to strike. “They will not stop this movement until the elected government is restored,” said Kyaw, a surgeon at West Yangon general hospital who has resigned from the government hospital where he worked. “I am upset about being apart from the patients, but I have no regrets, knowing that I did my best to help fight the pandemic,” he said. Doctors are instead treating patients in their homes and at charity health clinics. There have been no reports of street demonstrations against the army, but there is palpable anger among the public, who lived under repressive military regimes for five decades. On Wednesday night, the clanging of pots and pans echoed through the main city of Yangon, as people took to their balconies in a symbolic protest against the military. On social media, many adopted red profile pictures to signal their loyalty to Aung San Suu Kyi, who spent nearly 15 years in detention as she campaigned against military rule before being released in 2010. Within Myanmar, she is widely revered as a heroine of democracy, despite international condemnation over her treatment of the Rohingya.
The NLD has called for Aung San Suu Kyi’s release and urged the military to acknowledge the results of November’s election, which it won by a landslide. The military detained Aung San Suu Kyi in early morning raids on Monday, hours before the opening of parliament. It has accused the NLD of election fraud, a claim observers have dismissed as fabricated. She reportedly remains under house arrest. It also emerged on Wednesday that the International Monetary Fund last week sent $350m (£256m) in cash to the Myanmar government, part of a no-strings-attached emergency aid package to help the country battle the coronavirus pandemic. Days later, the generals seized power. The US, which has formally declared the military’s takeover a coup, has threatened to reimpose sanctions, while countries around the world have demanded the release of detainees and for the army to relinquish power. The G7 group of the world’s largest developed economies on Wednesday condemned the coup and said it was deeply concerned about the fate of detained political leaders.
At a meeting of the UN security council on Tuesday, however, China and Russia blocked a statement condemning the coup and calling for its reversal, while India and Vietnam also voiced reservations. China and Russia previously undermined attempts to pressure Myanmar over the atrocities committed against Rohingya in 2017, when a military crackdown forced 700,000 people to flee to safety in Bangladesh. In Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, where they remain trapped, refugees said they were even more afraid of returning now that the military is in total control. “The military killed us, raped our sisters and mothers, torched our villages. How is it possible for us to stay safe under their control?” Khin Maung, the head of the Rohingya Youth Association in the camps in Cox’s Bazar district, told Associated Press. “It will take a long time because the political situation in Myanmar is worse now.” Louis Charbonneau, the UN director for Human Rights Watch, said the failure of the security council to condemn the military would embolden its leaders to “feel they can engage in horrific abuses and pay little or no cost”. The army has claimed the coup is in line with the country’s constitution. The army chief, Min Aung Hlaing, now head of a new cabinet, on Tuesday defended the military’s action as “inevitable”. Civilian leaders, he said, had not listened to the army’s complaints of voter fraud. As public action to resist the military emerged, the military issued a warning in the state-controlled Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper.
“Some of the media organisations and people are posting rumours on social media, releasing statements to occur riot and unstable situation,” the English-language statement read. It called on people “not to make such moves and to cooperate with the government in accordance with existing laws”. Many have rushed to download the offline messaging app Bridgefy, which was used during Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests in 2020, after phone and internet services went down earlier in the week. The company said its app had been downloaded more than 1m times in Myanmar this week. The military has a grim record of using violence against to quash dissent, and protesting against it carries huge risks. A human rights activist based in Yangon said she believed other government workers would join civil disobedience action. “The numbers will grow, it is growing now,” she said."
2021-02-03T12:00:14Z,global-development,Global development,#Demlootchallenge: Zimbabwean activists sing to protest corruption,"Zimbabwean journalist Hopewell Chinâ€™ono has taken his fight against corruption to the ears of thousands around the world via reggae with a new song entitled â€œDem Lootâ€�. The reporter, who has been arrested three times in six months for his work challenging the current government, released a short video on Twitter singing against what he says is an endemic rot in Zimbabwe â€“ and it has sparked a flurry of follow up versions under the hashtag #demlootchallenge.
Zimbabweans on social media have joined his â€œchallengeâ€� to denounce corruption in their government, which is blamed for, among other things, the collapse of the countryâ€™s health system. Dem Loot (they steal) â€“ an adaptation of Jamaican musician Shabba Ranksâ€™s 90s release â€œDem Bowâ€� â€“ garnered 120,000 views in 24 hours on Twitter. Chinâ€™onoâ€™s version laments the lack of prescription drugs in the countryâ€™s hospitals and high rates of unemployment and poverty.
The song has been trending on social media, with other Zimbabwean producers and singers, including Austria-based Vusa Mkhaya, joining in the challenge, releasing their own reggae and jazz renditions, and versions using the mbira, the countryâ€™s traditional instrument. According to Transparency International, Zimbabwe loses $2bn (Â£1.5bn) to corruption annually. Chinâ€™ono told the Guardian that music was a powerful tool to engage young people in the country. He said it was important for youth to engage in political discourse. â€œMusic is a very powerful tool when dealing with corruption. You realise that in order to get to youth, you need to speak a language they understand. The song is meant for the youths to engage in day-to-day political discourse,â€� Chinâ€™ono said. â€œIt was not planned, but the song has become very popular, we have been trending for the past two days.â€� Chinâ€™ono was released last week from a maximum security prison after 20 days on allegations of communicating falsehoods, as the Zimbabwe government continues to clamp down on President Emmerson Mnangagwaâ€™s critics. Before the arrest, Chinâ€™ono was on bail on separate charges of inciting violence, after he voiced support for an anti-government protest in July last year, and on contempt of court charges for claiming corruption within the countryâ€™s national prosecution agency. He is known for exposing corruption by the former health minister, Obadiah Moyo, who was involved in a $60m Covid-19 supplies scandal. Moyo was later dismissed by Mnangagwa. There are only 21 countries more corrupt than Zimbabwe, according to an international transparency barometer of 179 nations.
In Zimbabwe musicians have often avoided political messages, while some who dared sing against the status quo used metaphors and idioms. Zimbabwean musicians often ignore political issues such as corruption, choosing instead to focus on social commentary. Unable to demonstrate due to Covid-19 restrictions, Zimbabweans have increasingly turned to social media to protest corruption and human rights abuses. Last year Zimbabweans sparked global movement #zimbabweanlivesmatter in protest over human rights abuses by the Mnangagwa government. The campaign was supported by musicians and other celebrities around the world, as Zimbabweans demanded an end to human rights abuses following detainments of well-known political activists."
2021-02-03T07:15:52Z,global-development,Global development,Decades of progress on extreme poverty now in reverse due to Covid,"Two decades of progress in the reduction of extreme poverty, the elimination of which is one of the sustainable development goals, have been pushed into a sharp reverse by a combination of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the growing climate emergency and increasing debt. With the World Bank warning of a “truly unprecedented increase” in levels of poverty this year, and renewing calls for debt forgiveness, experts are warning of a growing crisis in multiple areas from education to employment, likely to be felt for years to come. While the World Bank was already pessimistic, in January it updated its forecast for the expected number of newly impoverished people this year from between 88 and 115 million to the new range of between 119 and 124 million.
Global poverty has seen a spectacular decline since the 1960s – when about 80% of the world’s population lived in extreme poverty. Today that number has been reduced to nearer 10%, with hundreds of millions of people removed from the extremes of hardship. But the numbers are forecast to rise in the coming year, and it has not only been in the category of those living below the poverty line of $1.90 (£1.30) a day that increases have been seen. Experts have noted a worrying rise in numbers of people living on less than $3.20 (£2.35) between June last year and January 2021.
In recent months the growing crisis has been flagged up in multiple reports looking at indicators from the dropout rate in education in the developing world, to falling wages and rising unemployment, much of it driven by the pandemic, which has closed workplaces, schools and borders, and hammered the global economy. Among those issuing warnings has been the International Labour Organization (ILO), which said global workers lost $3.7tn in earnings during the pandemic.
In its annual Global Wage report, issued late last year, the ILO reported that wages had fallen or were growing more slowly across the board in the first six months of 2020 and warned that the Covid-19 crisis was “likely to inflict massive downward pressure on wages in the near future”, with “women and low-paid workers disproportionately affected by the crisis”. The report warned that even in the one-third of countries where average wages appeared to have increased, “this was largely as a result of substantial numbers of lower-paid workers losing their jobs and therefore skewing the average”. But it has been the long-term and less visible effects that are concerning many, not least the impact on education.
Among those voicing increasing concern is Axel van Trotsenburg, managing director of operations at the World Bank. “Our concern is that with this crisis we are seeing a reversal in the sustained reduction in extreme poverty and are now witnessing increases. The current estimates are an extra 150 million by the end of this year,” he said.
“This is a crisis that has shown just how fragile this progress is, and how much of an effort will be required to rebuild, not least faced with the addition of existing challenges like climate change. “On top of that we are seeing increases in the other poor and unemployed outside of the definition of extreme poverty. It’s a clear sign that this crisis is already producing serious ripple effects. “You have 1 billion kids out of school, and online education not accessible to many children in developing countries. We have done a lot of analysis on this, but just an extra year of school enhances earnings to the degree that if you lose that school year, then the estimate through lifespan, globally, means you are looking at a reduction in world GDP of $10tn. “There is also a disproportionate number of girls who, when they leave school, will permanently quit education so will lose even more.”
And while the pandemic has affected countries rich and poor, Van Trotsenburg believes that challenges facing poorer countries are more deep-seated. “One of the major challenges in developing countries is that the majority of employment is in the informal sector.” Andrew Shepherd and his colleagues at the Overseas Development Institute’s Chronic Poverty Advisory Network echo many of the observations of the World Bank and other global organisations. And as Shepherd’s organisation has pointed out, cuts to western aid budgets have further complicated the picture. “These budget cuts leave fewer resources available to tackle the longstanding challenges people have been facing, let alone the immediate struggles of daily subsistence and protection. In this context, the social and economic impacts of Covid-19 will continue to weigh heavily on low- and middle-income countries. And without adequate resources to tackle the overlap of poverty with climate change, conflict, crises of governance and uneven relationships with the global economy, these struggles will only be magnified.”
Shepherd points to the risk of new impoverishment in middle-income countries where families have left poverty in recent memory and are vulnerable to sinking back into it. “One of the things that we have been seeing is the impoverishment of new groups who were not impoverished in the normal course of events.”
While Shepherd points to the effects of educational dropout during the pandemic as leading to long-term impacts, some of the consequences are less predictable. “One aspect that came out of a recent study of returning migrants to Bangladesh from the Gulf [where they had lost their jobs], was that that their incomes had reduced to below other groups in labour markets, particularly in rural areas. “We had worked on the hypothesis that this group would be more resilient. And that has not been in the case. “The other big issue is in the urban informal sector in places such as Africa, people like market traders. With lots of markets closing, and the services dependent on them shutting down, that has meant a lot of loss of incomes.”
Homi Kharas, a senior fellow for global economy and development at the Brookings Institution, is concerned that for many of the global new poor, the impact of the Covid crisis is likely to last well beyond 2030. In a paper last year, while arguing that some poverty “will be offset as economies start to recover in 2021”, he added that “the longer-term scenario suggests that half of the rise in poverty could be permanent. By 2030, the poverty numbers could still be higher than the baseline by 60 million people.” Speaking in January, Børge Brende, president of the World Economic Forum, highlighted another critical issue. “If we’re going to go into pre-Covid levels of global GDP, we will need to start investing in each other’s countries through foreign direct investment – that has gone down dramatically in the last year and a half.” He added: “We also know that the global value chains and trade are struggling to get back to their pre-Covid levels. And we know that trade has been an engine of growth, and has lifted millions of people out of extreme poverty in the last three decades.”"
2021-02-03T06:30:51Z,global-development,Global development,"'Savage' cuts to UK aid put children's lives at risk, says Gordon Brown","The former prime minister Gordon Brown has launched a scathing attack on the unprecedented cuts to UK aid, saying they put at risk tens of thousands of children’s lives while millions more face losing an education. Writing in the Guardian, Brown said the planned cuts of 30% – £5bn – which come into force at the end of next month meant that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was “paying the bills for Covid off the backs of the poor – at home and abroad”. Brown’s intervention comes amid a chorus of increasingly dire forecasts, including from the World Bank, the International Labour Organisation and development experts, who have warned that two decades of progress in reducing extreme poverty have been moved into reverse. The elimination of poverty is one of the key sustainable development goals. The World Bank warned of a “truly unprecedented increase” in levels this year as it updated its prediction for the expected number of newly impoverished people to rise from 88-115 million to 119-124 million. Describing the return of extreme poverty after decades of sustained reduction as the “great reversal”, the former prime minister, who is a passionate campaigner on development issues, called for a new global growth and development plan. At its centre, he said, should be a $1.2tn “Marshall-style” plan for Africa as well urgent debt restructuring for the most impoverished countries. The Marshall plan was a US initiative to provide foreign aid to western Europe following the second world war.
Saying that the cuts “shamed” Britain, Brown added: “Never in our history has the overseas aid budget been cut so peremptorily, so savagely and by so much.” Writing that it would take “decades to undo the damage that is about to be inflicted”, Brown continued: “[It] is so severe that it is in breach of UK law, and current legislation will have to be repealed for it to be implemented. “And we have to ask: what moral compass is it that guides government ministers towards severing lifelines of support in the midst of the most devastating peacetime humanitarian emergency in a century? “For 20 years until now, the UK aid budget has risen, and global poverty has fallen,” he added saying that the cuts would reduce Britain’s aid budget by share of national income to below that of Saudi Arabia and Turkey. “Now, for the first time in two decades, global poverty is rising but, sadly, development aid is falling. We are depriving the world’s most vulnerable of food, medical treatment, and schooling, as surely as pulling away the needle from a child awaiting vaccination, whipping away the school meal from her hungry mouth and shutting the school gates on all those whose human right to education we promised to uphold. “Over 5 million young people will be denied the vaccinations for polio, measles and others they require, with the result that, according to a calculation by the Centre for Global Development, 100,000 children’s lives that could have been saved will be lost. Four-and-a-half million fewer children a year will receive an education.”"
2021-02-03T06:30:51Z,global-development,Global development,Rishi Sunak is paying Covid bills off the backs of the poor. It shames our country | Gordon Brown,"Nothing shames our country more than Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, paying the bills for Covid off the backs of the poor – at home and abroad. He has recently been pushed off his plan to cut £20 a week from the already low universal credit paid to 6 million of Britain’s poorest families. But the world’s poor, thousands of miles away, cannot defend themselves from the chancellor’s assault, and never in our history has the overseas aid budget been cut so peremptorily, so savagely and by so much. At the end of March, the 30%, £5bn reduction from the 2019 aid budget total will be so severe that it is in breach of UK law, and current legislation will have to be repealed for it to be implemented. And we have to ask: what moral compass guides ministers towards severing lifelines of support in the midst of the most devastating peacetime humanitarian emergency in a century? For 20 years until now, the UK aid budget has risen, and global poverty has fallen. Now, for the first time in two decades, global poverty is rising but development aid, sadly, is falling. We are depriving the world’s most vulnerable of food, medical treatment and schooling, as surely as pulling away the needle from a child awaiting vaccination, whipping away the school meal from her hungry mouth and shutting the school gates on all those whose human right to education we promised to uphold. It will take decades to undo the damage that is about to be inflicted. More than 5 million young people will be denied the vaccinations for polio, measles and others they require, with the result that, according to a calculation by the Center for Global Development, 100,000 children’s lives that could have been saved will be lost. Four and a half million fewer children a year will receive an education. “Global Britain” is being launched by telling 27 of the poorest countries in Asia and Africa that, at a stroke, their bilateral aid is being almost halved, and that Britain’s share of national income devoted to overseas development – once one of the highest at 0.7% – will fall to 0.5 %, below that of Saudi Arabia and Turkey. And when Boris Johnson arrives in Glasgow to chair November’s Cop26 climate change conference, he will have to explain why Britain’s contribution to solving what he says is the greatest existential problem facing the world is also about to be cut back. The government’s actions are as shortsighted as they are unprincipled. Covid cannot be finally and certainly eliminated anywhere if it is not eliminated everywhere. Given the risk that the virus mutates abroad and returns to ravage even those who have been vaccinated, it would be value for money for rich countries like Britain, that are losing trillions in economic output, to agree to share the burden of financing the vaccination of all the people of all the poorest countries.
The scale of the human tragedies and lives lost not just from Covid but from the consequent hunger and destitution should focus our minds. The great reversal in progress is happening at the very moment when the world’s poorest need our help most. Yesterday, the broadest possible coalition, from the Women’s Institute and Save the Children to the National Union of Students and the Wildlife Trusts, called for a renewed commitment to the 0.7% share of national income aid target and even if MPs vote to do so on urgent humanitarian grounds only – to deal with today’s emergency – the House of Commons should this month defy the government and defeat its plans.
As chair of this year’s G7, Britain should not be cutting aid but rounding up worldwide support for an urgently needed new global growth and development plan. At the heart of it should be a Marshall-style plan for Africa. To halt the rising tide of poverty there, we should push for an issue of what are called special drawing rights – $1.2tn (£0.9tn) of new international money – and allocate it to poverty-stricken countries. We should instruct another trillion in resources to be made available to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and implement a far more generous debt relief and restructuring programme. And if there is to be substance to the Johnson promise of 12 years’ education for girls, he should ask June’s G7 to fund a back-to-school plan that includes school meal provision for all undernourished children. For two decades and more, NGOs have worked closely with the UK government and, indeed, managed the implementation of many development programmes. The understanding was that both the government and NGOs would be ramping up efforts year by year to deliver the UN sustainable development goals. Standing side by side in campaigns such as Make Poverty History, the NGOs and the UK government would together lead the world, and the combination of our grassroots and intergovernmental pressure would persuade other countries to follow. A great deal was achieved over 20 years – $200bn of debt relief, a doubling of aid to Africa, new global health funds, which massively reduced infant and maternal mortality, and more recently, to Britain’s credit, the replenishment of the global vaccination facility and a new target to cut carbon emissions. But now that the UK government is reneging on its financial commitments to deliver on the sustainable development goals, NGOs will have to think again. It is right to be campaigners alongside governments when they are doing the right things, but it is right also to campaign to change the minds of governments when they are getting it wrong. And as we confront not just a threat to Britain’s standing as a global leader but also an urgent moral issue, this is preeminently the time to hear and heed the warning first issued by President John Kennedy that in the end “if a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich”.

2021-02-02T12:11:38Z,global-development,Global development,"The nights of pots and pans are back, on Myanmar's fearful streets","In Myanmar, if you want to drive evil from your home, you bang pots and pans. Yangon’s streets were filled with the din of clashing metal in 2007, when monks called for an end to military rule, and before that, in 1988 when the former president Sein Lwin, or the “butcher of Rangoon”, ordered troops to shoot pro-democracy protesters. On Tuesday night, pots and pans were back again. Evil has returned, they say; Gen Min Aung Hlaing has led a military coup against the democratically elected government and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, whose immense popularity within the country helped her National League for Democracy (NLD) win a landslide victory in 2020. The military’s electoral proxy secured fewer than 7% of available seats, leading it, and the military, to claim widespread electoral “fraud” without evidence. But now Aung San Suu Kyi is reportedly under house arrest in the capital, Naypyidaw, and the elected lawmakers who were to start a new parliamentary term and tackle the impact of Covid-19, poverty and ethnic conflict in the beleaguered country have been confined inside their government housing, surrounded by soldiers. “People are feeling anger, fear and loss,” said a 24-year-old activist who asked for anonymity. “Now the international community’s involvement is key. The military must be pressured and made to feel alone. “Japan, Korea and China should withdraw their development plans in Myanmar. We have seen that sanctions don’t have that much effect – I will leave it at that.” At 8pm, the first rattles and shakes echoed down the streets of Yangon, rumbling into a chorus of cheers and spoons clashing against pans. Cars hit their horns, cyclists rang their bells and passersby smacked their hands against signs and stone. This first public rejection of the coup went on for 10 minutes across the city in a massive show of solidarity. Central Yangon had been quieter than usual on Tuesday morning, but people soon ventured out into a new, uneasy world. Queues that snaked from ATMs and supermarkets the previous day had dwindled, while telephone lines and mobile internet services that had been patchy since the first hours of the coup began to return. A form of normality was restored, though one fraught with anxiety over the next move either from the military or from the public, many of whom are not willing to accept another military dictatorship. Kyaw, 80, a retired hotel manager, has lived through several coups and new constitutions in Myanmar, but he fainted twice after hearing that the military had seized power. “It’s the youngsters who will be most affected,” he said. “It’s a very sad day for the country and our future. No good will come from this. As for those who have done this, I hope they burn.” While military trucks remained outside City Hall in downtown Yangon and pro-military protesters gathered at a local park on Tuesday, the first stirrings of resistance emerged. A teachers’ federation called for the release of detained politicians and student leaders, Yangon Youth Network announced a civil disobedience campaign and doctors in Mandalay refused to work under the military junta. Yoon, 18, a student, was jumpy, but hoped everything would go back to normal. “Everything has been disturbed and people are trying to adapt but it feels impossible,” he said. Memories of the electricity and food shortages after the 1988 pro-democracy protests are still vivid for many – but even more the brutal onslaught brought by the military against protesters. “In a country like Myanmar, there’s no such thing as feeling safe,” said Khin, a 29-year-old teacher. “This is one of the most bitter days I have experienced in my life.”
In the streets, some residents have quietly removed posters of the NLD to avoid the scrutiny of the military and its supporters, but to a larger extent profile templates of Aung San Suu Kyi and her party have sprung up on Facebook – Myanmar’s dominant mode of online communication. “I’m disgusted about the people who have taken over our country,” said Tun, 19, who had returned from a US university to Myanmar during the pandemic. “The country is turning to garbage.” Young or old, however, those who oppose the military understand what its soldiers are capable of. Instead of giving them a reason to shoot into a crowd, on Tuesday night they showed their solidarity with pots and pans."

Researchers looked at cases of pregnant women trying to reach hospital in Nigeria’s most populous city, infamous for its roads, and found they faced a journey of up to four times longer than computers and satellites suggest, which mean the models for access to healthcare facilities are also out of kilter. The findings of the study published last week in BMJ Global Health fly in the face of assumptions that Nigerian women in towns can access maternal care far more easily than those in rural areas, said researchers from the London School of Economics (LSE), the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp.
The study collected data from 738 pregnant women who arrived at four of Lagos’s largest public hospitals with life-threatening complications. Estimating their travel time using computer models and online maps, researchers sent out drivers to reconstruct their journeys and found that travel times were one and a half times longer than Google maps predicted, and four times longer than computer models. “There are huge life and death implications of travel time to reach facilities for pregnant women in emergency situations,” said LSE’s Dr Aduragbemi Banke-Thomas. “The World Health Organization recommends that women should be able to access health facilities within two hours,” he said, pointing out that online models all suggested they had, but that was not the case. Worldwide 295,000 women die every year from complications of pregnancy and 99% of those deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, with Nigeria accounting for 23%, according to Unicef. While this study focuses on Lagos, the authors suggest long travel times to hospital are “likely the case in other big African cities as well”. • This article was amended on 2 February 2021 to remove an erroneous description of Lagos as Nigeria’s capital, which is Abuja."
2021-02-01T16:21:23Z,global-development,Global development,"Worker at H&M supply factory was killed after months of harassment, claims family","The family of a young garment worker at an H&M supplier factory in Tamil Nadu who was allegedly murdered by her supervisor said she had suffered months of sexual harassment and intimidation on the factory floor in the months before her death, but felt powerless to prevent the abuse from continuing. H&M said it is launching an independent investigation into the killing of Jeyasre Kathiravel, a 20-year-old Dalit garment worker at an H&M supplier Natchi Apparels in Kaithian Kottai, Tamil Nadu, who was found dead on 5 January in farmland near her home. According to police reports, a man working as a supervisor at Natchi Apparels has reportedly confessed and been charged with her abduction and murder. Her family allege that she was also raped and are awaiting the result of a forensic report. The family and a local union representing female workers at Natchi Apparels claim that Kathiravel had attempted to report the harassment and intimidation she was suffering at work, but no action was taken. They also allege that gender-based violence at the factory was widespread.
“Her family and co-workers have told us that Jeyasre was being harassed at work but nothing was done,” said Thivya Rakini, state president of the Tamil Nadu Textile and Common Labour Union (TTCU), which represents women working at Natchi Apparels. “Many workers we have spoken to say they are facing the same problems but either don’t know how to report grievances against their supervisors or say they are afraid if they speak out they will face retaliation.” The factory is owned by Eastman Exports, India’s fourth largest garment export company, which is a large supplier to H&M and other western brands. Kathiravel had been working at the H&M supplier for more than two years in order to put herself through higher education, her family said. “She was the first in our family to have the chance of having a life outside the garment factories,” said Muthulakshmi Kathiravel, the victim’s mother. “My daughter told me that she was being tortured at work. I do not want other people’s daughters to suffer the same fate.” H&M said it has zero tolerance for gender-based violence in its supply chains. It said it is launching an independent third-party investigation of alleged incidents of harassment at Eastman Exports and is working to improve worker safety in its factories in Tamil Nadu. But international labour rights groups the Asia Floor Wage Alliance (AFWA) and the Global Labor Justice-International Labor Rights Forum (GLJ-ILRF) claim that H&M’s apparent failure to police its own codes of conduct on gender-based violence or to ensure that there was a “responsible process” after Kathiravel’s murder had put the family and other women working in its supply chain at risk. “We believe the continued sexual harassment that has been reported to us, followed by the rape and murder of Jeyasre Kathiravel, is a direct result of Eastman Exports and H&M’s failure to respond to the extreme and widespread conditions of gender-based violence and the ongoing violations of freedom of association facing workers in Natchi Apparel,” said Anannya Bhattacharjee, international coordinator at AFWA. The groups also accuse H&M of failing to adequately intervene to stop the alleged intimidation of Kathiravel’s bereaved family by Eastman Exports managers in the weeks after her death. After their daughter’s body was found, the family say they faced mounting pressure to accept financial compensation and sign documents releasing the H&M supplier of any responsibility for Kathiravel’s death. There is no suggestion that H&M was aware or party to this. On 29 January, the family claim that Eastman Exports managers brought a mob of 50 men to their village who forced their way into their home and demanded that they accept a cheque for £5,000 (500,000 rupees) and sign documents they had not read. In videos seen by the Guardian of the incident, Kathiravel’s family and women from the TTCU, the union which supports local garment workers, can be seen surrounded by a large crowd of men shouting at them to sign papers. Kathiravel’s mother, Muthuakshmi Kathirvel, was taken to hospital after the incident and said it had left her fearing for her life. “I did not want to sign documents but they forced me to, threatening me and my family.” She said that she wanted there to be an investigation into the failure to protect her daughter from sexual harassment and for the TTCU union to be allowed into negotiations to speak for the workers.
In a statement, Eastman Exports said that the intention for the visit to the family’s home had been to provide financial support to the victim’s mother “at this difficult time”. “We understand that this outreach may have created the impression of us pressuring or influencing the deceased employee’s family. We have instructed all our management staff and persons representing Eastman to put on hold any outreach for now.” Eastman Exports also said it had zero tolerance for gender-based violence and that there were credible internal complaints procedures in place at its factories. It said the factory had received no reports of harassment from Kathiravel and that an investigation by a local NGO had concluded that Kathiravel and the man charged with her murder were “deeply in love” and that the family did not hold the factory responsible for her death. International labour groups said H&M must use its power as a foreign buyer to ensure that any gender-based violence was eradicated from Eastman Exports factories and across all its supply chains. “Fashion brands [such as H&M] that contract with Eastman Exports advertise codes of conduct and sustainability programmes. Yet at the bottom of their supply chains is a pattern of harassed women workers and a grieving mother met with a mob,” said Jennifer Rosenbaum, executive director at GLJ-ILRF. Rosenbaum said that in 2018 a report by GLJ-ILRF uncovered multiple cases of gender-based violence in H&M’s supply chains but that the findings had not resulted in any significant response from the brand. In a statement, an H&M spokesperson sent condolences to the family and said: “The trade unions involved have explicitly asked us not to terminate the business relationship with the supplier in question, and instead actively work to strengthen the workplace safety. We are therefore in close contact with the supplier and have set some immediate and urgent actions that we expect them to complete in order to demonstrate how they can guarantee a workplace free from harassment.” It said any future relationship with Eastman Exports would depend on the outcome of an independent third-party investigation."
2021-02-01T07:15:00Z,global-development,Global development,‘Police searched my baby's nappy': migrant families on the perilous Balkan route,"An Afghan girl pulls her baby sister along in a pram through the mud and snow. Saman is six and baby Darya is 10 months old. They and their family have been pushed back into Bosnia 11 times by the Croatian police, who stripped Darya bare to check if the parents had hidden mobile phones or money in her nappy. “They searched her as though she were an adult. I could not believe my eyes,” says Darya’s mother, Maryam, 40, limping through the mud and clinging to a stick. The Guardian followed the journey of Darya and that of dozens of other migrant children who, every day, walk, or are carried on their parents’ backs through the snowy paths that cross the woods around Bosanska Bojna, the last Bosnian village before the Croatian border, in an attempt to reach an increasingly inhospitable central Europe. Few families are successful. Most of them are stopped by Croatian police, searched, allegedly often robbed and, sometimes violently, pushed back into Bosnia, where, for months, thousands of asylum seekers have been stranded in freezing temperatures, without running water or electricity.
In December, fire destroyed a migrant camp in Bosnia, making the situation worse. “Out of a total of about 8,000 migrants in Bosnia, about 2,000 people are basically left to fend for themselves in abandoned buildings, squats, makeshift settlements and in forests,” Nicola Bay, the Danish Refugee Council’s Bosnia director, says. “These people include families, children and unaccompanied minors that have practically no shelter, no access to basic services and no access to proper healthcare.” According to the council, in 2020 more than 800 children were pushed back by the Croatian authorities, including many under the age of six. The number of families living on the border between Croatia and Bosnia has increased considerably in recent months, and thus the number of children. Most of those in transit have come from Greece, where a new law approved by Athens last year has stymied the administrative procedures for the recognition of refugee status. Tired of waiting, just when they thought their odyssey had ended, it has pushed many to get back on the road and try to reach the heart of the European Union through the Balkans. “It’s very difficult to have a complete overview on the motivations pushing people to leave Greece and move north to the Balkan road to reach other destinations in Europe,” says Stephan Oberreit, head of mission at Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Greece, “but it’s clear that increasing delays in the asylum processes and in family reunification claims, the appalling living conditions, and lack of protection and integration lead people to continue their perilous journeys until they find safety and dignity.”
It is a strenuous journey, crossing mountains and snow-covered forests, with virtually no welcoming facilities for migrants. Many of the children of the migrant crisis living in abandoned or destroyed houses in Bosanska Bojna today were born along the route, like Darya, whose name means “sea”, and who was born in Lesbos before a blaze in September destroyed the Moria camp. “We were tired of waiting for the Greek authorities to consider our asylum application,” says Hasan, 52, the father of Darya and her six siblings, who left Kunduz, in northern Afghanistan, a year and a half before. Hasan says that if there had been no war in his country, he would never have found himself in these forests, watching Croatian policemen search Darya’s nappy – the searching of babies being a common practice, according to the watchdog organisation Border Violence Monitoring Network (BVMN). “Although, in most cases, women and children are not directly subjected to physical violence by the Croatian authorities, they are still subjected to what can be described as psychological violence, abuse and humiliation,” a field coordinator for BVMN, says. “Women and young girls have reported being searched everywhere by male Croatian police officers. Moreover, there are incidents in which the police have searched children’s clothes or babies’ nappies, thinking their parents have hidden phones or money.” On 16 October 2019, two Palestinian and Syrian families were stopped near the village of Glina, Croatia, and forced to undress. “The children were also searched and the babies’ diapers had to be removed. They were naked, in the forest, in the middle of the night,” one told BVMN. In October, BVMN reported the case of an Afghan mother who “described feeling uncomfortable when the male officers touched her body to look for phones and money”, and then when an officer stuck his hand into the nappy of her 11-month-old baby boy. “We also have had a significant number of cases of women, some of them underage girls, being forced to strip by the Croatian police,” Bay says. “Their father is asked to cover them with a blanket. When you listen to their testimonies, they say, ‘I’m covering my teenage daughter with a blanket,’ but there’s obviously one part of the blanket where you can see through, because you can’t pull it all the way around and there’s a policeman standing right there.”
Numerous women say they were beaten in front of their children, who were also pushed around. “During the last pushback, my four-year-old son, Milad, asked the police for water,” Maryam tells the Guardian. “But the Croatians denied him, took him by the shoulder and pushed him away. I tried to react and explain to them that they couldn’t do it. Then they kicked me on the back and I rolled to the ground. Today, we will try to cross the border again and inshallah, we hope to make it.” On the road that leads from the Bosanska Bojna valley to the Croatian forest trails, other families leave their shelters and set off again with their entourage of children and strollers. “Today, we go for game!” yells a smiling six-year-old. Although there is little fun, “the game” is what migrants call the crossing from Bosnia into Croatia so that their children see it as a sort of adventure, with the aim of not being caught by the men in black uniforms who hide in the woods. The goal is to reach an elusive place called France, Italy or the UK. In the frost and the mountains, they are encouraged by their parents to play, chasing each other and climbing trees. But in the late evening, when the children return to their wet and crumbling shelters in Bosanska Bojna, after being pushed back once again by Croatian police, it is easy to see that they did not have fun. “Families including children, the elderly, women and young men who experience this brutality will carry the psychological trauma with them for years,” says Maham Hashmi, an MSF humanitarian officer. “They will always have in mind that Europe brutalised them instead of protecting them and their right to seek asylum.” “The most common mental health issues that we observe among children on the move are related to symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress as a result of the violence they have witnessed and that can potentially leave long-term consequences on their mental health”, says Tatiana Olivero, a coordinator in Bosnia and Herzegovina for Médecins du Monde (Doctors of the World). “These children have been through highly stressful experiences, such as war and persecution in their country of origin, and have witnessed violence during their path towards Europe, including the abusive treatments imposed on their parents during multiple pushbacks. Some are losing hope for the future and see their childhood denied.”
Zohra, 33, a Kabul lawyer and mother of four, says her children are struggling: “When we get our things ready for the crossing, my children don’t want to go. They cry because they are afraid of being pushed back, or being kicked, like last time.” In 2016, a bomb attack during Ramadan killed her seven-year-old son. His twin, Nourin, now 11, was paralysed on one side of her body. Last November alone in Kabul, a series of bomb attacks launched by insurgents left at least 88 people dead and more than 193 injured. But many European countries continue to repatriate asylum seekers to Afghanistan. During the lastest attempt at crossing, captured on Guardian cameras, Nourin and her siblings remained hidden for almost an hour in a dried-out ditch at the side of a trail, as two Croatian policemen guarded the area from a hill less than 200 metres away. Zohra and her husband, Ibrahim, later decided this was too much of a risk and not a good time to move on. They will try again tomorrow. During their five-month stay in Bosnia, they have been pushed back 37 times, despite informing the border authorities of their request for asylum.
The pushback record in Bosanska Bojna is held by Fariba Azizi and his three children who, at around 7pm on 22 January returned from the Bosanska Bojna woods after their 54th pushback. When they got back, they found their shelter reduced to rubble: Bosnian special forces that week burned all the informal migrant camps in Bosanska Bojna. According to charities, citizens in the area had protested over the presence of migrants in those places. But mostly the inhabitants of the villages around Bosanska Bojna offer food, blankets and clothing to the migrants. Memories of the war are still fresh in many Bosnians’ minds. They know all too well what it means to be forced out of their homes.
Of at least eight families the Guardian followed over five days last week, only two managed to cross the border into Croatia. On 28 January, Darya’s family informed the Guardian they had made it to Zagreb. It is an important step, but not the last. There are many cases of migrants who reach Croatia and are sent back to Bosnia by the authorities there. The same happens in Slovenia and Italy, where, last week, the court of Rome declared more than 700 pushbacks perpetrated by Italian police in Slovenia illegal. “Pushbacks are illegal, whether they are violent or not, it doesn’t matter,” says Bay. “They fundamentally undermine the right to international protection. Croatian pushbacks are a consequence of EU policy – aimed at transferring the responsibility for protecting people outside of the EU. It has become a situation in which member states regularly ignore, circumvent or directly violate EU law, and this has [become] a standard way of managing borders. “The perpetrators need to be held accountable. For member states that don’t comply with these measures, there have to be real consequences. There have to be sanctions of some form. Up until now, for years, essentially, there has been impunity for violations of European [Union] laws.”
The Croatian ministry of the interior told the Guardian said they will thoroughly investigate the incidents, including alleged violence against children. However, a spokesperson said “in order to achieve their goal, migrants are willing to use all means necessary, including bringing their own lives and the lives of their family into danger, knowing that if they find themselves in such a dangerous situation that the Croatian police will save their lives. Likewise, if the Croatian police prevents them in their attempt of illegal entry, they are ready to falsely accuse the same Croatian police of violence and obstruction of access to the system of international protection. “We would like to point out that the Croatian police are authorised to check persons and their luggage in order to find items which may be used to escape, attack or inflict self-harm. This is a legal power, which police officers regularly exercise during their work in order to protect themselves and to establish general security,’’ they added. In the email, the minister announced that a group of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) intended to visit Croatia to observe the Croatian police’s anti-immigration practices. The delegation of Italian MEPs, belonging to the parliamentary group of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), arrived in Zagabria last Saturday. They decided to visit the Bosnian border area that same day to witness migrants as they make their way into Europe. But their plans were immediately thwarted as Croatian police chased and stopped them just as they reached the check-point at the Bosnian border, sparking a row in Italy. “This is a grave act, without precedent”, the MEPs told the guards as the Italian newspaper Avvenire filmed the exchange. “What’s beyond that border? What do you want to hide from us?.” Bosanska Bojna, with hundreds of children stranded in the snow, lies just on the other side. Some names have been changed to protect the privacy of individuals.

2021-01-31T11:00:36Z,global-development,Global development,Crushing costs of Covid care leave grieving Mexican families facing ruin,"For more than 50 years, Pedro Martínez would drive his truck through the mountains of Jalisco state, carrying stock for clothing business in the week, and taking his family on excursions at the weekend. Martínez, 90, was long retired when he was admitted to hospital in early October with coronavirus-linked complications. His family prayed he would soon recover and return home, but 33 days later he died, leaving them emotionally and financially ruined. “This illness broke us,” said his 54-year-old son Manuel. “The moment came when we had to decide whether we had to mortgage the house or take out a loan. We sold everything we could: a plot of land, jewelry, my father’s truck – which we sold as junk for $300.” Few countries have suffered more from coronavirus than Mexico, where an average of nearly 1,300 daily deaths are being recorded during a punishing second wave of infections. On Thursday – with both Mexico’s president and its richest man fighting the illness – the country’s official death toll rose above that of India to more than 155,000, the third highest number on Earth. Many believe even those numbers underplay the true scale of the catastrophe and that it actually has the second highest death toll after the US. For many Mexican victims’ families, the devastating emotional toll has been accompanied by brutal economic price: the exorbitant cost of medical care for patients with the virus has left many in debt or bankrupt or forced to sell everything they have to cover treatment and hospital bills.
Pedro Martínez had paid health insurance for more than a decade and thought that would cover his treatment. What he didn’t realize was that the deductibles would jeopardise his entire family’s finances the moment he entered hospital in the western state of Jalisco. “We had to pay $2,500 before they’d even admit my father to hospital. Then two days later they asked us for $5,000 more,” said Manuel, speaking by phone from Cuquío, the village where the family lives a two-hour drive from the hospital in the city of Zapopan. “My father was getting worse, and the bill was getting bigger. In less than a week they asked us for a deposit of $15,000 or they wouldn’t treat him. When he died there was a bill of more than $60,000” – more than 13 times Mexico’s average annual wage. Covid-19 is now one of the five most expensive illnesses to treat in Mexico, alongside HIV and cancer, with an average treatment cost of $20,000 – although the price-tag can go beyond $1m in cases where patients go into intensive care or are put on ventilators.
One of the most widely used drugs to treat Covid patients in Mexico is Tocilizumab, which has an average price of $500 per dose, and is not covered by many health insurance plans. The economic crisis faced by Pedro’s family was such that they were forced to halt his pulmonary rehabilitation therapy 10 days before he died. “There was no money for the treatment, so we had to suspend the physiotherapy,” said Manuel. “Being intubated was very painful for him, and he was having therapy twice a day, but we reached the point when there was no more money to pay for them.” According to the Mexican Association of Insurance Institutions, without medical insurance it is almost impossible to cover all expenses associated with coronavirus. Even if a patient is not admitted to hospital, treatment at home with oxygen and drugs costs an average of $3,000. In early November, as Mexico’s second Covid wave began to gather pace, Pedro died of a heart attack. The doctors said by then he was free from coronavirus, but his lungs had been weakened and he had picked up a bacterial infection from his intubation. “I keep asking how this is possible,” his son Manuel said as he came to terms with their loss and ruination. “I just can’t believe that now we don’t have money to pay for electricity, or water or gas – and neither do we have my father.”"
2021-01-30T14:59:32Z,global-development,Global development,Brazil: viral rapper becomes unexpected champion of Covid vaccine drive,"Leandro Aparecido Ferreira laid bricks and flipped burgers for a living until becoming one of Brazil’s most famous funk musicians. This year, the 26-year-old – whose stage name is MC Fioti – has added a new and unexpected string to his bow: as an unlikely champion of science and vaccinology in a country being pounded by coronavirus. A remix of Fioti’s biggest hit – celebrating Covid inoculation and boasting a music video shot at one of Brazil’s top biomedical research centres – has become a viral sensation, notching up millions of YouTube views and sparking a nationwide outpouring of emotion.
“I’m still trying to get my head around everything that’s happened but I can see I quit my job in that fast-food restaurant to make history,” the rapper said this week as his “vaccine anthem” made headlines and playlists around the world. Fioti is unsure who first noticed his sexually charged 2017 hit Bum Bum Tam Tam had the potential to become a celebration of science, although the answer lies largely in wordplay. The song’s original title – formed by the Portuguese word for a bottom (bumbum) and the sound of a percussion instrument (tam tam) – bears an uncanny similarity to Butantan, the Tupi-Guarani-derived name of the São Paulo research institute now producing millions of doses of the CoronaVac. That discovery gave the catchy Bach-sampling track a new lease of life and encouraged Fioti to update its lyrics so they praised doctors, not derrieres. “This is the intriguing vaccine, that messes with your mind … and will cure us from the virus and save loads of lives,” he sings in the new version. São Paulo’s governor, João Doria, a prominent rival of Brazil’s Covid-denying president, Jair Bolsonaro, quickly spotted the song’s marketing potential and called the rapper. He was invited to shoot a new clip inside Butantan’s research centre shortly before the start of vaccination on 17 January. When Fioti arrived at the Butantan compound, he found staff members and scientists, who appear in the three-minute video as dancing extras, raring to shake their stuff. “It was all so natural – they wanted to do it as much as me. This energy comes across in the clip.” Fioti was cautious in his comments about Bolsonaro, a far-right populist who has sabotaged Brazil’s vaccination campaign by declaring that he will refuse to be vaccinated himself and even suggesting the Pfizer vaccine might turn people into alligators. Critics also accuse Bolsonaro’s administration of failing to secure sufficient vaccines to properly protect the country’s 212 million citizens. More than 220,000 Brazilians have now lost their lives, second only to the US. But the funk musician, who has lost one close friend to Covid, said he worried many were influenced by the president’s denial of science and argued Brazilian lives were “worth much more than the word of a president”. “It’s not normal for people to be dying. It’s not normal to say that’s just how it is, that we’ll all die one day,” he added, in an allusion to Bolsonaro’s inflammatory remarks on coronavirus which he calls a “little flu”.
Fioti said he hoped his music could spread a fact-based, life-saving message about the benefits of inoculation. “When I started thinking about doing this version, I told my followers on social media and lots of people said they wouldn’t get vaccinated. After hearing the song the very same people got back to me to say they had changed their minds,” said the fatherof one. “We are getting the message across. But more than 2 million people have already died around the world,” he said. “We’ll only get rid of this virus together and by getting vaccinated.” Fioti, who hails from the gritty south side of São Paulo, recalled dropping out of school to help his mother pay the bills by serving food at Burger King. “So for me, as an artist from the ghetto, it’s a massive thrill to see funk join hands with science to save lives.” • This article was amended on 30 January 2021 to correct the spelling of the research institute Butantan."
2021-01-30T08:45:04Z,global-development,Global development,Malawi sex workers protest at 'targeted police brutality' after Covid-19 curfew,"Dozens of sex workers took to the streets of Malawi’s capital Lilongwe on Thursday to protest against what they described as “targeted police brutality” following new Covid-19 restrictions. The protests were led by the Female Sex Workers Association (FSWA), which has about 120,000 members across the country, according to its national coordinator, Zinenani Majawa. The southern African country has seen Covid numbers rise dramatically this month, prompting the government to take drastic action, with land borders closed and isolation orders for anyone arriving by air. Malawi now has 21,660 confirmed cases, 13,646 active and 7,249 who have recovered, according to ministry of health data. Most of the 555 deaths from the virus have come this year, prompting President Lazarus Chakwera to declare a state of national disaster. Two of his ministers and other government officials are among those who have died. But the sex workers said some of the new retrictions had led police to target them. These include an 8pm curfew on bars, with customers required to take away drinks, and an order that no one must be found socialising between 9pm and 5am. “Because of the new Covid-19 laws, police have taken advantage of the law by coming and knocking in our rooms and beating us. We haven’t heard of a case where they went to married people’s homes to knock at their doors and beat them but because they know that we are found in the rooms they are coming there,” Majawa told the Guardian.
“Some of our members have sustained wounds,” said Majawa, adding that Covid-19 preventive measures should not override human rights. FSWA has petitioned the government to extend the closing time for bars to midnight and keep them open at weekends, saying “business is not working since our clients have disappeared”. “We believe that sex work is work. We pay our bills including rents and food from this work. We even send our children to school from the money that we get,” Majawa said. “It is noted that some gathering places like churches have maintained their normal gathering hours while observing the preventive measures and we feel segregated and discriminated hence we request to uplift the measures and let us do business as usual while observing the preventive measures.” She added that sex workers were destitute and she feared some might die of hunger. The association has warned of problems with antiretroviral treatment, “as one needs to have food before taking the HIV/Aids medication”. The new measures include a requirement to wear masks in public, and reports of police beating people without masks have drawn presidential condemnation. President Chakwera said: “Citizens found to be in violation of public safety laws must be subjected to due process, not police brutality or beatings. Malawi is not a police state, for what we have in the country is a police service not force.” Public transport ground to a halt on some routes this week in Lilongwe and the commercial capital Blantyre as minibus drivers claimed they were running at a loss. They have asked the government to allow them to carry more passengers or reduce the price of fuel. Minibuses are heavily relied upon by workers and business people in the cities. The police did not comment on the allegations. There was no immediate comment from the government on the petition from sex workers but the attorney general, Chikosa Silungwe, told the Guardian the legality of sex work was a divisive issue. He said the government would look at the issues raised and respond."
2021-01-30T07:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,WHO's Covid warnings were not heeded. Now the world has a new chance to beat the virus,"A year ago, on 30 January, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the new coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern – the highest level of alarm at our disposal under international law. At the time there were 98 confirmed cases and no deaths reported outside China. The WHO repeatedly urged all countries to capitalise on the “window of opportunity” to prevent widespread transmission of this new virus. Some countries heeded these and earlier warnings and did well. Others did not. This is borne out by the tragic milestones the world has since passed, including the deaths of more than 2 million people and more than 100m confirmed cases. This pain has scarred our communities and collective consciousness. The suffering felt by those with long Covid, many whom I have come to know well, is heartbreaking. In the outbreak’s first two weeks, WHO issued wide-ranging guidance to stem the spread, care for patients and equip health workers. The WHO helped scientists publish the first PCR tests days after Chinese scientists shared the genetic sequence of the virus. This led to the rapid development and rollout of tests and the promise offered today by the lifesaving potential of vaccines.
This new window of opportunity must be grasped with both hands. We must prioritise equity. All at-risk people in all countries, especially health workers, older people and those with underlying conditions, need access to vaccines – not all people in some countries. Vaccines have been administered in more than 50 countries so far. Not surprisingly, it is the poorer countries that have been unable to start rolling out vaccines. Rich nations have made bilateral deals with manufacturers to vaccinate entire populations, sometimes several times over. This has left countries under huge domestic pressure to start immunising their populations little choice but to make their own arrangements. This has resulted in manufacturers prioritising more profitable deals with rich countries, rather than support equitable rollout of vaccines to all countries. Calls for equity must be backed by action. This means greater investment in the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global initiative launched in April to spur the development and distribution of vaccines, treatments and diagnostics, with an end game in sight for this pandemic. There has been overwhelming global backing for the ACT-Accelerator and its vaccines pillar, Covax, which has been endorsed by 190 countries and economies. But the ACT-Accelerator has a $27bn (£19bn) financing gap for 2021. This is a fraction of the projected global economic cost of up to $9.2tn if governments do not ensure developing economies have equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines.
To stay ahead of the virus, we must prioritise science, especially as we see new variants emerge. To address this, we cannot let up on testing, even as the virus is spreading far and wide. Governments must increase genomic sequencing capacities, which are not available widely enough, leaving many countries unaware of mutations of the virus. But I am encouraged by many signs of progress. Covax, so far, has agreements in place to access at least 2bn doses of several promising vaccine candidates. Pfizer has committed up to 40m doses of vaccines for Covax. We are confident that other vaccines will be approved and rolled out in the coming weeks. I also recognise the support governments have shown for protecting their health workers. In line with this, the WHO is calling on the world to ensure the vaccination of health workers and older people is under way in all countries within the first 100 days of 2021. If we succeed, we will be on track to bring the pandemic under control, and by this time next January, we will find all countries and communities of the world on a healthier, safer and more sustainable path for the future.

2021-01-29T17:08:02Z,global-development,Global development,'Finally some justice': court rules Shell Nigeria must pay for oil damage,"A Dutch court has ordered Shell Nigeria to compensate farmers for major oil spills they say caused widespread pollution. On Friday an appeals court in The Hague rejected Shell’s argument that the spills were the result of sabotage, saying not enough evidence had been provided. The court ordered Shell’s Nigerian subsidiary to compensate the farmers for the losses caused by the oil spills in the two villages of Goi and Oruma in 2004 and 2005. The amount of compensation had not yet been decided. It also ruled the parent company, Royal Dutch Shell, and its subsidiary must install warning equipment on its Oruma pipelines to limit the environmental damage in case of another spill. The court said Shell Nigeria had not done enough to clean the soil around the sites of the spills. The farmers claiming compensation argued the damage was caused by oil leaking from the pipeline, which could have been prevented if Shell had installed the correct detection systems. “Finally, there is some justice for the Nigerian people suffering the consequences of Shell’s oil,” said Eric Dooh, one of the Nigerian plaintiffs, in a statement released by Friends of the Earth Netherlands, which supported the case. “This verdict brings hope for the future of the people in the Niger delta.” Dooh’s father was one of two complainants who died during the case, which has gone on for 13 years. The Hague appeals court ruled in 2015 that Dutch courts had jurisdiction in the case, seven years after the four farmers first sued, and after debate over whether Shell’s parent company should be held liable for the Nigerian subsidiary’s actions. “This is fantastic news for the environment and people living in developing countries,” said Friends of the Earth’s Netherlands head, Donald Pols. “It means people in developing countries can take on the multinationals who do them harm.” Shell Nigeria said in a statement it still believed the spills were caused by sabotage and was disappointed by the ruling. “Sabotage, crude oil theft and illegal refining are a major challenge in the Niger delta,” it said. “Like all Shell-operated ventures globally, we are committed to operating safely and protecting the local environment.” The court also ruled Shell had proved sabotage was the cause of a third spill, at an oilwell in the village of Ikot Ada Udo, but it had not decided whether Shell was liable for the damage."
2021-01-29T11:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,Chile police officer sentenced for killing of Mapuche farmer on 'historic day',"A Chilean police officer has been jailed for killing a Mapuche farmer during a vehicle chase in a case that cast a harsh spotlight on the country’s treatment of its largest indigenous group.
Camilo Catrillanca, the 24-year-old grandson of a prominent Mapuche indigenous leader, was shot in the back of the head in November 2018 in Temucuicui, a small community 600km south of the capital, Santiago. His death – and a subsequent attempted cover-up by police officers – caused widespread public outrage and reignited deep-seated grievances over the Chilean state’s treatment of the Mapuche. On Thursday, the police officer, Carlos Alarcón, was sentenced to 11 years in prison over Catrillanca’s death, with an extra five years for the attempted killing of a 15-year-old boy who was on a tractor with Catrillanca. Ingrid Conejeros, a Mapuche educator and human rights defender, hailed the sentencing as a “historic day” for Mapuche rights. “There have been cases of Mapuche killings that weren’t even investigated,” she said. Other human rights activists also welcomed the sentence, which came as the country’s police face accusations of widespread human rights violations – including rape and torture – during a nationwide wave of anti-government demonstrations in 2019. “It’s a light of hope. A first step,” said Vania Ortega, legal director of the police watchdog NGO Opip. But she stressed that police impunity would continue “unless these sentences stop becoming an exception, and start to become the general rule”. Chile’s national police force, known as the Carabineros, has faced broad condemnation for its heavy-handed response to protests over inequality that began in 2019 and left at least 30 civilians dead, hundreds blinded by shotgun pellets and thousands injured. Officers have long enjoyed reduced sentences with high impunity rates for their crimes. Rights defenders believe the historic ruling in the Catrillanca case may change the abusive nature of the institution. Chile’s National Human Rights Institute presented 2,520 legal complaints against armed forces a year after the social uprising – only 31 of them have been investigated.
The Mapuche have long accused the Chilean state and private companies of appropriating their ancestral lands, plundering their natural resources and using indiscriminate violence against them. Alarcón was part of a controversial special forces unit called “the Jungle Commandos”, trained in anti-terrorism operations specifically related to internal armed conflict over land rights. The unit was disbanded after Catrillanca’s death, but armed confrontations and arson attacks have continued to escalate in La Araucanía, the southern province that is home to the majority of the Mapuche population. In January, a landowner, who was not Mapuche, was shot and killed outside his home by unknown assailants. His son demanded that the authorities take greater control of the region. The same day, eight police officers were injured and one was killed during controversial anti-narcotics raids on several Mapuche communities. Mourning the two unrelated deaths, President Sebastián Piñera vowed that “action will be taken”. Amid fear that armed police operations will intensify in light of the killings, the National Human Rights Institute encouraged authorities to engage in dialogue, stating that violence “exacerbates intercultural conflict” in southern Chile."
2021-01-29T10:37:22Z,global-development,Global development,Biden move to refund UN population agency is 'ray of hope for millions',"The decision by US president Joe Biden to refund the UN population fund, UNFPA, offers “a ray of hope for millions of people around the world”, said the agency’s executive director. Dr Natalia Kanem said the announcement on Thursday would have an “enormous” impact on the agency’s work, particularly as the world continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. In 2017, the Trump administration halted funding to the UNFPA, claiming it supported coercive abortion and involuntary sterilisation – claims strongly denied by the agency. The US was one of the agency’s largest funders. In 2016, it provided $69m (£50m) to support its work in more than 150 countries. “Ending funding to UNFPA has become a political football, far removed from the tragic reality it leads to on the ground. Women’s bodies are not political bargaining chips, and their right to plan their pregnancies, give birth safely and live free from violence should be something we can all agree on,” said Kanem. She added that the pandemic had hit particularly hard the vulnerable communities in which the UNFPA works. “US support will be instrumental in helping us build back better and fairer.”
US secretary of state Antony Blinken said his department would appropriate $32.5m to support the UNFPA this year. “UNFPA’s work is essential to the health and wellbeing of women around the world and directly supports the safety and prosperity of communities around the globe, especially in the context of the global Covid-19 pandemic,” he said. Blinken also confirmed that the US would withdraw its support for the “Geneva Consensus Declaration” – an anti-abortion policy introduced last year by the then secretary of state Mike Pompeo, and signed by more than 30 countries, including Brazil, Hungary and Uganda. “The United States is re-engaging multilaterally to protect and promote the human rights of all women and girls, consistent with the longstanding global consensus on gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights,” said Blinken."
2021-01-29T09:30:51Z,global-development,Global development,'Violence starts at home': the Afghan women tackling domestic abuse at its source,"Nabila felt her diesel-drenched clothes stick to her skin, her lungs filling with fumes, hot panic rising. It hadn’t been the first time an argument with her husband had escalated: he’d been beating her throughout their 30-year marriage, even tying her to a tree in the garden outside their small home in Afghanistan’s capital Kabul, leaving her freezing in the winter cold. But after the attempt to set her on fire Nabila – who asked for only her first name to be used – ran away for good. Four years on, the 50-year-old lives in a small apartment with her mother, working as a cook and cleaner at a private school, haunted by the abuse, and afraid her undercover life might one day be exposed. “I had wanted to divorce him for a long time,” she says, “but I didn’t even know where to seek help. I’d like to write down my life’s story one day so everyone can read it – especially women in similar situations.” About 87% of Afghan girls and women experience abuse in their lifetime, according to Human Rights Watch. A 2009 law on the elimination of violence against women had been celebrated as a hard-won victory by activists, but has since been largely ignored, with few victims able to seek justice. A new campaign, based in Kabul, is now aiming to lower this figure. The initiative, Talk for Harmony, has partnered with activists, religious scholars and psychologists in a mass media and social media campaign, offering meditation and counselling services to victims and perpetrators, and broadcasting advice on how to handle stress and where to seek help. “Violence starts at home and it can slowly move out – into the streets, the schools, everywhere. That’s why it needs to be extinguished at the source,” Freshta Farah of the Afghan Women’s Network – the organisation implementing the campaign – told the Guardian.
Farah puts abuse into different categories – verbal, physical and emotional. She says most cases of domestic violence, something mainly experienced by women, never reach court and are solved within families or left unsettled, often dragging on for decades. “Violence has been normalised in many homes and has become a coping strategy for dealing with external pressures,” says Balqis Ehsan, a research officer at Magenta, the technical organisation that put together the campaign’s videos and radio messages. “It’s straightforward,” Ehsan says. “We use Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to reach both victims and perpetrators and we have partnered with local television and radio stations that play our clips. People can call a free-of-charge number to get help and can even request in-person mediation sessions in Kabul.”
Before the launch of Talk for Harmony, research across eight of the country’s 34 provinces showed that since the coronavirus pandemic began, 35% of respondents – victims and perpetrators – reported an increase in gender-based violence, with a third of all women who took part in the study saying they didn’t know where to go or how to get help. Among the respondents, 30% thought it “acceptable” to beat a woman who leaves the house without telling anyone, while 17% felt it was “acceptable” to use violence if a woman refused to fulfil their “marital duties”. “At the start of the pandemic, many families were stuck at home. Economic pressures mounted and in such situations, violence is sometimes used as a first coping strategy,” Ehsan says. Soraya, 57, a university-educated working mother of five, was married at 13. Even as the family’s main financial provider, she still faces regular verbal and emotional abuse. She asked to be referred to by her first name only.
“Both my husband and I face difficulties – living in a country at war is difficult enough and our society puts additional pressures on us. He deals with it by letting out his anger, by regular outbursts. As a woman, I am expected to hide my feelings,” she says, adding that while she doesn’t feel free, her husband’s permission to let her study and work has opened opportunities for her. “Violence is not the answer to angry emotions,” Freshta Farah says. Talk for Harmony is scheduled to run for the next two months, but the Afghan Women’s Network hopes that this is just the beginning. “We have a long way to go to extinguishing domestic violence at its source,” Farah says."
2021-01-29T07:45:39Z,global-development,Global development,We are seeing a global vaccine apartheid. People’s lives must come before profit | Winnie Byanyima,"Nine months ago world leaders were queueing up to declare any Covid-19 vaccine a global public good. Today we are witness to a vaccine apartheid that is only serving the interests of powerful and profitable pharmaceutical corporations while costing us the quickest and least harmful route out of this crisis. I am sickened by news that South Africa, a country whose HIV history should have taught us all the most appalling life-costing consequences of allowing pharmaceutical corporations to protect their medicine monopolies, has had to pay more than double the price paid by the European Union for the AstraZeneca vaccine for far fewer doses than it actually needs. Like so many other low- and middle-income countries, South Africa is today facing a vaccine landscape of depleted supply where it is purchasing power, not suffering, that will secure the few remaining doses. Nine out of 10 people living in the poorest countries are poised to miss out on a vaccine this year. Production delays put even this figure in doubt. Unjustifiably high prices block access and threaten to push more countries into an ever-deeper debt crisis. If we continue to pursue the vaccine model we have, we will fail to get this pandemic under control for years to come. Failure to change course will come at the cost of millions of lives and livelihoods around the world; to our progress on tackling poverty; to businesses, including those represented here at the World Economic Forum this week; and to our collective public health and economic security. Make no mistake, the costs of vaccine inequality will not be confined to those living in the poorest countries. The longer the virus is allowed to continue in a context of patchy immunity, the greater the chance of mutations that could render the vaccines we have and the vaccines some people in rich countries have already received, less effective or ineffective.
Research commissioned by the International Chamber of Commerce published this week predicts that delays to vaccine access in poorer nations will also cost the global economy an estimated $9tn (£6.6tn), with nearly half of this absorbed in wealthy countries such as the US, Canada, Germany and the UK. We cannot rewind the past nine months or the failure so far of governments to enact their pledge to make Covid-19 vaccines global public goods. But we can and must act now to change the otherwise catastrophic trajectory of this pandemic. The vaccine science, knowhow and technology, paid for in large part by more than $100bn of taxpayers’ money, can no longer be treated as the private property of pharmaceutical corporations. Instead, these must be shared openly, via the World Health Organization’s Covid-19 technology access pool, so that more manufacturers can be brought on board and a global plan put in action to scale up vaccine production. To clear the pathway for this, governments must also urgently back the proposal tabled to the World Trade Organization to temporarily waive intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines, treatments and tests until the world has reached critically needed herd immunity and this pandemic is under control. Almost every business on the planet has had to step away from business as usual as a result of this pandemic. It is in all our interests that pharmaceutical corporations now do the same. I invite governments and business leaders to join the growing call for a “people’s vaccine” and together chart a new path that can secure enough vaccines, tests and treatments for all people in all nations. • Winnie Byanyima is executive director of UNAids and a UN undersecretary general"
2021-01-29T07:15:38Z,global-development,Global development,"Slavery survivors moved ‘without notice, without reason’ in London lockdown","Modern slavery survivors with young children were among refugees allegedly forced to move accommodation in London with as little as one day’s notice during coronavirus lockdowns this winter. Women who are among the UK’s most vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers said they were given just 24 hours to pack before being moved from accommodation provided by the Home Office, often having to travel long distances across the capital, in late December and January. Some said the accommodation they had been moved to had not been cleaned or was substandard – with a slug infestation in one property – and there were reports of “aggressive” behaviour from housing management staff, with one young mother saying she was forced to throw away many of her belongings and a 56-year-old woman in poor health reporting that a housing manager visited her bedside to tell her she must move the next day. The Home Office advises that if people seeking asylum in the UK need to be moved, a letter will be sent to them “confirming the arrangements”. But of the five women who spoke to the Guardian, all said they had received no letter before being told by phone or in person that they needed to move within days and, in some cases, without being given a reason. “I checked my post [for a letter]. It was just before Christmas. I asked the manager, ‘why call me to move now?’” said Abeke*, 27, a modern slavery survivor from Nigeria. She said she was told by the housing manager from Clearsprings, the company contracted by the government to house asylum seekers in London, by phone on 18 December that she had to move the next day from the accommodation she had been living in for three years because the landlord “needs the house back”. She said she had “no choice, no time. Even animals are treated better.” Her new accommodation had not been cleaned after the previous resident left and had leaking, cracked walls held together with tape, she said. “There were slugs in the bedroom. It was disgusting. Even the [previous resident’s] bin bags were still there. It took me three days to clean it.” Her experience appears not to be an isolated one. Another trafficking survivor from Nigeria, Marie*, 33, said she was told on 1 January that she would be moved the next day along with her three-year-old son. Her asylum claim had been denied – a decision that is being appealed by her lawyer. “The first thing I asked the manager was: ‘Are we really moving in this pandemic? I have a little child with me. I don’t even know if the people in the new house are OK. In this period, third lockdown, you can still call someone and say they have to go?’”
She said she initially refused to move on the grounds that she had not received written confirmation, but after a “battle” with Clearsprings she was moved earlier this month. She said she had still not received a letter about the move. Marie said she was told by the people moving her that she could not bring all of her possessions. “He was aggressive and said: ‘Your stuff is too much, as an asylum seeker you have no right to have more than your backpack and your son’s backpack.’” The new flat is far from shops and her son’s nursery, she said, and unsuitable for a child. “There’s nowhere my baby can play. There’s no space for him. It’s messed up, everything’s broken. They told me we need to keep it clean but there’s no dustpans and no [vacuum cleaner].” Eniola*, a 57-year-old Nigerian who has sciatica and chronic arthritis, said she was struggling to leave her bed when she was told on 7 December that she had to move out of the National Asylum Support Service accommodation she shares with four families in west London three days later.
“I was in bed very sick, shaking, with double jumpers and duvet cover. I cannot get up to cook and was in chronic pain. I cannot move loads. “He [the housing manager] was so rude to me. I couldn’t sleep, and was forcing myself to pack, but the pain was getting worse.” After being sent to hospital and discharged by a doctor who said she should not be moved, she has stayed put and hasn’t heard anything since. Some of the women take part in two related community music programmes based in east London that support survivors of modern slavery, Bombo Productions and Amies Freedom Choir, part of Pan Intercultural Arts. Bombo’s artistic director, Dr Victoria Jassey, said she noticed that some of the women in the choir she runs were upset during their first meeting in January. “When we logged into our Zoom choir meeting the first week after Christmas, three of the women were demonstratively upset. They told me that they had been told to move accommodation without notice, without reason, during the Christmas period, during a lockdown, to a place where they knew no one – to a place where the house managers talked down to them, and in two cases, to a place they felt was inappropriate for their young children. “This was not the first time I had seen women from this group upset from being uprooted suddenly and without explanation. The timing and the lockdown make it even more shocking. Even if this practice is legal, it shouldn’t be. What type of society treats vulnerable women and young mothers like this?” Tim Naor Hilton, head of asylum at Refugee Action, said: “Moving vulnerable people across the country to new accommodation with sometimes no more than an hour’s notice can have a terrible effect on their wellbeing. “People seeking asylum can be retraumatised because they often have no idea where they are being taken and they must leave – at the drop of a hat – groups of friends or other support networks they have formed. “It’s essential that people are given longer notice and told where they are going so they can properly prepare themselves and reduce the impact on their mental health.” At the beginning of Covid lockdowns in March 20202, the government announced a temporary suspension of evictions of asylum seekers facing homelessness as part of its “everyone in” policy, and limited moves “unless necessary”. The suspension on evictions ended in September and has not been reinstated in the current national lockdown. There are currently about 5,630 asylum seekers in London, 465 of them from Nigeria, more than half identified as potential victims of modern slavery trafficked into the UK, mainly to be forced into sex work or domestic service. Clearsprings manages “dispersal” accommodation, where asylum seekers live while their claim is determined, in London on behalf of the Home Office. It was not clear in these individual cases whether the Home Office or Clearsprings were responsible for the lack of notice allegedly given to the women and the alleged failure to confirm arrangements in writing. Clearsprings referred the Guardian to the Home Office for comment. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We have not been provided with sufficient information to look into these specific claims. However, we are required by law to provide asylum seekers with suitable accommodation and during the pandemic we have had to secure additional sites due to pressure on the system. “We acted quickly and decisively last year to look after asylum seekers’ wellbeing by increasing their level of financial support, temporarily suspending evictions and limiting moves unless necessary and appropriate. “The safety and security of modern slavery victims is a top priority, and the modern slavery victim care contract provides tailored support to help potential and confirmed victims rebuild their lives.” * Names have been changed"
2021-01-28T20:39:03Z,global-development,Global development,Joe Biden axes 'global gag rule' but health groups call on him to go further,"Health groups around the world are celebrating the end of a harmful policy banning US funding for overseas aid organisations that facilitate or promote abortion, which was scrapped by the US president, Joe Biden, in a presidential memorandum on Thursday. Reproductive rights advocates are urging the new administration to now go further and permanently repeal the Mexico City policy – known as the “global gag rule” – to prevent it being reinstated by a future Republican president. The policy has been blamed for contributing to thousands of maternal deaths in the developing world over the past four years. The gag rule prevents overseas organisations that receive American aid from using their own money to provide information about abortion, or carry out abortions. First adopted by the Reagan administration in 1984, it has been repealed by every Democratic administration and reinstated by every Republican one in the years since. In a short appearance in the Oval Office on Thursday afternoon, Biden said he ended the policy as part of an effort to “protect women’s health at home and abroad”. But Donald Trump went further than previous Republican presidents. The policy usually applies to family planning organisations. But the Trump administration expanded the policy to include all global health programmes, including programmes that address HIV, nutrition, malaria and cholera. Widening the rule increased the pool of aid funds it affected from roughly $600m to about $12bn (£8.7bn), according to the Guttmacher Institute, a health policy research group.
“We can breathe,” said Serra Sippel, the president of the Center for Health and Gender Equity, of Biden’s plans to repeal the policy. “There’s just so much hope and optimism in Washington DC right now. We have a lot of work to do, but it’s so much better.” The consequences of Thursday’s memorandum will ripple out from Washington into more than 70 countries including some of the poorest places in the world, where essential women’s health operations were abruptly halted or scaled down after Trump reinstated the rule in January 2017. In Zimbabwe, a women’s health team run by Abebe Shibru, from the organisation MSI Reproductive Choices, cut its operations by 60%. “We reduced our outreach from 700,000 women to about 300,000,” Shibru, who now heads the organisation’s Ethiopian operations, told the Guardian. “Women missed out on information, they had no access to family planning, and in return they were exposed to unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortion, which contributed to higher maternal mortality.” Zimbabwe’s teenage pregnancy rate increased by 2% over the past four years, according to Unicef data, a trend Shibru said was exacerbated by cuts as a result of the gag rule. “We were not providing services to rural women, so they had no choice but to get pregnant against their wish,” he said. Pledging conferences attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in donations from governments and private groups to try to bridge the gap in American funding, but could not meet the total shortfall. An assessment of the rule’s impact released last year, surveying health organisations in Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and Nepal, found a sector in “crisis” with confusion over what was banned and permitted using US aid, a growing stigma around reproductive health services and widespread closures and scaling downs of programmes. Trump’s ban also spawned a new wave of activism, including a new grassroots movement, SheDecides, which is pressuring policymakers around the world to commit to upholding reproductive and sexual health rights. Zara Ahmed, the associate director of federal issues at the Guttmacher Institute, said repealing the gag rule “is just the first step in undoing [the US’s] current status as the greatest global hindrance to reproductive health”. “We are glad that the Biden-Harris administration is addressing the global gag rule … But let’s be clear, repealing the global gag rule is the bare minimum this administration can do to address the harm caused by the previous administration’s coercive and spiteful approach to foreign policy,” she said. “The Biden-Harris administration can, and must, take a comprehensive approach to unravelling the dangerous, punitive and coercive policies the outgoing administration has woven into our foreign policy, and it must take action to address longstanding harmful policies like the Helms amendment.” The Helms amendment has been widely misinterpreted as a total ban on US funding used for abortion overseas, when in fact it can be used to support abortion in cases of rape, incest or a woman’s life being in danger. A bill to permanently repeal it was introduced last year. On Thursday, the Global Health, Empowerment and Rights Act (Global Her Act) to permanently repeal the global gag rule will be introduced for the third time in Congress. The bill, co-sponsored by the new vice-president, Kamala Harris, has received cross-party support, and hopes are high it will pass. “It’s not automatic and it’s not going to be easy but we’re starting in a very strong place to get the act passed,” said Sippel. “If not the bill itself, but the language of the bill incorporated into another bill. Getting rid of the GGR, that’s what we’re striving for.” Sippel also called on the Biden administration to disavow the “Geneva consensus declaration” – an anti-abortion policy Trump promoted last year – to “signal to the world that abortion and LGBTQ rights and sexual and reproductive rights are important, and to state that loudly to the world”. She added that some activists wanted the Biden administration to issue a formal apology for US policies on sexual and reproductive health and rights over the past four years. Biden also ordered funding restored to the UN population fund, UNFPA, which Trump stopped. The agency’s executive director, Natalia Kanem, hailed the “enormous” impact of the decision. “Ending funding to UNFPA has become a political football, far removed from the tragic reality it leads to on the ground. Women’s bodies are not political bargaining chips, and their right to plan their pregnancies, give birth safely and live free from violence should be something we can all agree on,” she said."
2021-01-28T12:34:54Z,global-development,Global development,"Refugee rights 'under attack' at Europe's borders, UN warns","The right to asylum is coming under increasing attack at Europe’s borders, the UN’s refugee body is warning. UNHCR says it is alarmed by mounting expulsions and pushbacks of refugees and asylum-seekers and is calling for states to urgently investigate and halt increasing violence against people at Europe’s land and sea borders. The 1951 refugee convention, the European convention on human rights and EU law require states to protect the right of people to seek asylum and governments cannot automatically deny entry or forcibly return or push back people without assessing their need for protection. “Respecting human lives and refugee rights is not a choice, it’s a legal and moral obligation. While countries have the legitimate right to manage their borders in accordance with international law, they must also respect human rights. Pushbacks are simply illegal,” said Gillian Triggs, assistant high commissioner for protection. UNHCR was receiving a “continuous stream of reports of states restricting access to asylum, returning people”, she said Triggs said: “The pushbacks are carried out in a violent and apparently systematic way. Boats carrying refugees are being rounded up after they land and then pushed back to sea. Many have reported violence and abuse by state forces. People arriving by land are also being informally detained and forcibly returned to neighbouring countries without any consideration of their international protection needs.” In December a 1,500-page “black book” documenting hundreds of illegal pushbacks was handed over to the European commission. The reporting focused on the Balkan migration route, a journey known for hardship and violence.
On the sea border between Turkey and Greece, NGOs have collected evidence of refugees being ill-treated and sent illegally from Greek waters back towards Turkish shores. As the Guardian reported, pushbacks in Greece appear to involve teams of unidentified men in black uniforms intercepting boats and forcibly returning refugees to Turkish waters. The EU border force agency Frontex is already under investigation by the EU’s anti-fraud watchdog, Olaf, over a range of claims including allegations that its guards had been involved in forcing refugees and migrants out of EU waters at a Greek-Turkish maritime border. The most incendiary claims about the involvement of Frontex border guards in pushbacks – denied by the agency – are also the subject of an internal investigation. In a statement in October Frontex restated its commitment to preventing refoulement, or illegal pushbacks, of people seeking international protection. UNHCR said that the Covid-19 pandemic should not be used as an excuse to deny the right to asylum or refugee status “The Covid-19 pandemic provides no exception; it is possible to protect against the pandemic and to ensure access to fair and speedy asylum processes,” said Triggs. She said that the numbers of arrivals into the EU are decreasing each year. Around 95,000 people arrived by sea and land in 2020, a drop of 23% on the previous year. “With so few arrivals to Europe, this should be a manageable situation. It is regrettable that the issue of asylum remains politicised and divisive despite such declining numbers.”"
2021-01-28T11:30:10Z,global-development,Global development,‘They use old cloths’: Sri Lanka to give schoolgirls free period products,"In a village school near the beach, Koshala Dilrukshi teaches English to students from Uswetakeiyawa, a Sri Lankan fishing village. On most days, Dilrukshi says, some of the girls in her class will be missing. They go absent when they have their periods. It’s not uncommon throughout Sri Lanka. More than half of the adolescents responding to a Unicef study in 2015 did not want or weren’t allowed to go to school during their periods, while 37% miss one or two school days each month. For most, fear of staining, pain and discomfort are the main reasons for not going to school. Sanitary towels – usually imported – are subject to high taxes and for a long time women’s groups have tried to stop that by campaigning to have them classified as essential items. While there are about 4.2 million women and girls of menstruating age in the country, only 30% have access to tampons or pads. Now the Sri Lankan government has said it will provide free, locally made pads to about 800,000 schoolgirls. The project will prioritise children in poorer rural areas and also aims to build toilet facilities in 2,500 schools. It could transform girls’ learning. “It’s a great step, depending on how we implement it,” says Nayanathara Jayathilaka, a student social worker from Galkiriyagama, a village 100 miles from the capital, Colombo. “I recently talked to 10 girls from the village. Five of them have never used sanitary towels. They use old cloths.” Many families have to share toilets with no proper facilities and women often have to reuse cloths or rags. Poor menstrual hygiene practices can lead to health conditions, including cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer among Sri Lankan women. Jayathilaka says that cloths also lead to more staining, one of the reasons for girls missing school. For many communities, menstruation remains a taboo; 60% of schoolteachers in Sri Lanka think period blood is impure.
While some women simply don’t have the money for sanitary products, Jayathilaka says stigma is also an issue. Young girls shy away from buying pads in local shops, while others just aren’t aware of menstrual hygiene. Dilrukshi believes that teachers have a responsibility to educate students about personal hygiene methods. Her school has more than 900 students, most of whom come from single-parent families. Mothers often find jobs in the Middle East while fathers work long hours as fishmongers. “If you take 10 girl children in my class, eight of them can’t afford pads. The other two wouldn’t buy pads because they are shy. Their parents are not with them, so they come to us,” says Dilrukshi. “As teachers, we buy pads from our own money and keep them in the staffroom for any child who needs them.” Both Dilrukshi and Jayathilaka think schools should be conducting awareness programmes before distributing free sanitary towels. “The Ministry of Education can work with healthcare workers, social workers and civil society organisations to conduct education programmes to bust stigma, and teach period hygiene,” Jayathilaka says. She believes that could also lead to more open conversations about sex and health education.
Tarangee Mutucumarana, at the Arka Initiative, a health project in Sri Lanka, agrees. “Not only schoolgirls, but we should also teach the boys. Menstruating is a normal biological function. It should no longer be a taboo topic.” The Arka Initiative has already begun a programme that could be a model for the government to tackle period poverty, visiting communities and holding discussion sessions for women to discuss periods and sexual health. “Yes, most women hesitate at first, but when you start talking to them, they open up. They tell us about their problems. They are ready to listen and learn why period hygiene matters,” says Mutucumarana. The group is about to install the first machine to make cotton pads in a village in Mathugama, creating jobs for rural women. Mutucumarana wants the government’s plan to encourage people to opt for eco-friendly reusable options such as menstruation cups and cotton pads. “As a country, distributing free sanitary towels to schoolchildren should have been implemented earlier. We are late but better late than never,” says Mutucumarana. “We must realise that access to period products are a basic necessity, and not a luxury.” Sign up for the Global Dispatch newsletter – a fortnightly roundup of our top stories, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues:"
2021-01-28T07:30:05Z,global-development,Global development,Mining giant Glencore faces human rights complaint over toxic spill in Chad,"The UK government has accepted a human rights complaint against mining and commodities giant Glencore regarding a toxic wastewater spill in Chad, where dozens of villagers – among them children – claim they suffered severe burns, skin lesions and sickness after contact with contaminated water. The complaint, brought by three human rights groups on behalf of affected communities, alleges environmental abuses and social engagement failures by the FTSE-100 company in relation to two spillages, the wastewater spill and an alleged oil spill, both in 2018. Officials at the Department for International Trade, which monitors whether UK-based companies implement OECD guidelines for responsible business, decided the issues raised “merit[ed] further examination”. This case marks the first time that Glencore has faced an OECD complaint in the UK. In September 2018, a wastewater basin holding a crude oil by-product collapsed at Glencore UK’s operations in Badila, southern Chad. Some 85m litres of runoff – equivalent in volume to 34 Olympic-sized swimming pools – flooded fields and the local river, which local people use for drinking, bathing and washing.
At least 50 people reported burns, skin lesions, sickness and diarrhoea after bathing in or using the contaminated river water in the weeks after the leak. Many of those harmed were children, some of whom were admitted to hospital. One 13-year-old boy was unable to move his body for a year after swimming in the river, which doctors attributed to the “crude oil burns”. Livestock drinking from the river also died, according to the complaint. Residents claim the wastewater basin had been leaking for weeks before it collapsed, but Glencore failed to properly address the problem or to warn local residents about the impending danger. They also say Glencore has still not acknowledged the harm caused or provided remedy. A few weeks after the wastewater incident, residents also reported an oil pipe leak, which is contested by the company. “The UK’s decision to accept the complaint provides an opportunity for those harmed at Glencore’s operations to finally be heard and to find remedy for the harms they suffered,” said Anneke Van Woudenberg, executive director of the human rights group Rights and Accountability in Development (Raid), which was among the groups that filed the complaint. Raid published a detailed report about the alleged abuses in March last year. “For more than a year we have tried, along with organisations in Chad, to get Glencore UK to appropriately investigate these claims and to compensate those affected. And although they’ve made promises, none of them have resulted in any remedy, nor has there been an independent investigation into what happened. This is why we launched the complaint. “No community, whether they are in a remote area of Chad or elsewhere, should have to wait more than two and a half years for a company to investigate whether its toxic spill caused injury, especially when it involves so many children.” The National Contact Point (NCP), the UK body which oversees the implementation of OECD guidelines for multinational companies, will now mediate between the parties. If that fails, the NCP will examine whether the violations highlighted by the human rights groups occurred and will publish its findings.
In a statement to the Guardian, Glencore said: “Glencore has participated in the UK NCP’s initial assessment of the complaint and acknowledges their decision that the issues relating to the 2018 wastewater incident merit further examination. “We also note that UK NCP’s decision to further examine aspects of the complaint is not a finding against Glencore UK or a determination by the UK NCP that Glencore UK has acted inconsistently with the guidelines. “Glencore is committed to operating in a safe and responsible manner in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. We actively manage and mitigate any impacts our operations may have on local communities and the environment. We recognise that our presence can deliver sustainable benefits to those living around our operations and to the national economy of Chad. We transparently report on our performance and welcome the opportunity to build and strengthen relationships with civil society representatives.”"
2021-01-28T06:28:07Z,global-development,Global development,"Italy 'failed to protect life' in 2013 drowning of 200 people, rules UN","Italy failed in its duty to protect human life by delaying a rescue mission for a sinking boat in the Mediterranean, the UN Human Rights Committee found on Wednesday. More than 200 people who had been on board drowned on 11 October 2013 after repeated requests for help were ignored, according to a ruling by the committee on a case brought by Syrian and Palestinian survivors who lost their relatives. The boat was carrying 400 people, many of them Syrians, when it left Libya. It sent out a call for help after shots were fired at it from another boat. According to the investigation, the Italian authorities responded to the distress calls by referring the situation to the Maltese coastguard. It was not until almost five hours later, when the boat had already capsized, that a Maltese boat arrived at the scene. “Had the Italian authorities immediately directed its naval ship and coastguard boats after the distress calls, the rescue would have reached the vessel at the latest two hours before it sank,” said committee member Hélène Tigroudja. “The accident happened in the international waters within the Maltese search and rescue zone but the location was indeed closest to Italy and to one of its naval ships.”
The committee said Italy had a duty under international law to protect the lives of anyone in distress at sea and to support rescue missions. It called on Italy to hold an independent investigation and prosecute anyone responsible. The committee’s finding was announced as the UNHCR called for an extra $100m (£73m) in funding, highlighting the need to protect people along the migratory routes to Europe. It said increasing violence in Africa’s Sahel region, which has displaced 2.9 million people, as well as new displacement caused by conflict in Ethiopia, raised concerns about more people trying to reach Europe. “We hear harrowing first-hand accounts of brutality and abuses that refugees and migrants suffer along the routes towards the Mediterranean. Many fall prey to traffickers and smugglers and are abused, extorted, raped, and sometimes killed or left to die,” said Vincent Cochetel, the UNHCR’s special envoy for the Mediterranean sea crisis. The UNHCR said the extra funding would be used to support and protect migrants, as well as to educate people about the risks of the journey to Europe. It called on countries to ensure there were safe and legal routes for refugees. More than 1,000 people died or went missing trying to reach Europe from north Africa in 2020 and another 480 died or went missing from the west African coast. Last week, 43 people died when a boat capsized in the Mediterranean, hours after leaving the Libyan coast."
2021-01-27T13:18:17Z,global-development,Global development,'Things are getting worse': Tunisia protests rage on as latest victim named,"The latest victim of Tunisia’s current unrest has been named as Haykel Rachdi, from Sbeitla in Kasserine, near the Algerian border. He died of his injuries on Monday night after reportedly being struck on the head by a police teargas canister. Protests were continuing on Wednesday, with police pushing back hundreds of mainly young demonstrators outside the country’s parliament in the capital, Tunis. One group had marched there from the working-class district of Hay Ettadhamen, in the north of the city. The protesters chanted refrains from the revolution of the winter of 2010–11 and anti-police slogans, while inside, politicians continued to debate whether to accept or reject a proposed new government, the fifth since 2019’s inconclusive elections. The unrest continues to dominate much of public life. Across Tunisia, civil society groups and people from marginalised districts are demanding economic development, an end to police brutality and the release of an estimated 1,400 people arrested in the disturbances. Tunisia has been beset by political infighting and the police force remains almost entirely unreformed since the revolution that its own actions helped to spark. Even before the pandemic destroyed the country’s vital tourist industry, Tunisia’s economy was struggling. Unemployment – a key driver of social unrest – remained ingrained at around 15% of the labour force nationwide, increasing to 36% among 15 to 24-year-olds, a prominent demographic among those now demonstrating.
In Ezzahrouni, a marginalised district west of central Tunis, Nassredine described the poverty that drove the district’s youth to violence. Declining to give his surname, he told how, despite his four diplomas, he hadn’t worked for two years. Instead, he found himself forced to rely on handouts from his mother, a pensioner. “When I see people migrating [to Europe] illegally, I really can’t blame them,” he said, “Things are getting worse. Everywhere is closed now,” he said. Despite being lauded as one of the Arab spring’s successes, instability has continued to rack Tunisia in the past decade, as its successive governments have failed to tackle the yawning gulf between rich and poor. The latest reshuffle of the country’s coalition government included the appointment of four ministers accused of either corruption or conflicts of interest and was explicitly rejected by the president, Kais Saied. This undermined any hope of the kind of political consensus Tunisia needs to weather the pandemic and make the systemic reforms protesters seek. According to the International Monetary Fund, the country’s already moribund economy contracted by an “unprecedented” 8.2% in 2020. The drop has been felt across Tunisia, but nowhere more so than in the poor neighbourhoods surrounding Tunis and in the hardscrabble interior regions where, even before the pandemic, unemployment was as much as 30%. In these areas, with the pandemic having closed down opportunities for the type of casual day labour that kept many families afloat, anger over government inaction, aggravated by police violence, has exploded.
Along the street, Nassredine’s comments chimed with the thoughts of four young men huddled in a bus shelter sharing jokes and cigarettes. About a year and a half ago, 23-year-old Ahmed had attempted to leave Tunisia, after saving up the 7,000 Tunisian dinars (around £1,800) to take a boat to Europe. He was caught and returned shortly after putting out to sea, minus his money and having lost the chance of a new life. Aymen, a 23-year-old off-duty police officer showed a picture of himself masked and injured in the leg from a rock thrown during the protests. He had asked to be deployed away from his own neighbourhood, reluctant to confront some of his friends who took part in the unrest.
Aymen was welcome in the shelter, but the actions of other police officers across Tunisia has again drawn attention to a culture of brutality and impunity that is unchanged since the revolution of 2010–11. Teargas and baton charges have been deployed against protesters, both peaceful and volatile, with wearying regularity. The Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH) has estimated that, of the 1,400 protesters arrested so far, approximately 30% were minors. It said that few had been offered lawyers and none of those claiming to have been beaten were medically examined. On Monday, a joint report by the online newspaper Meshkal and the blog Nawaat contained damning accusations of police violence and arbitrary arrests from the families of those now detained. In one account, the mother of a 16-year-old described how she had arrived at the police station to see officers kicking her son around “like a ball” as they interrogated him. The interior ministry has promised to investigate some of the abuse allegations, as well as a video that appears to show a police officer firing teargas into a house. However, buttressed by powerful trade unions, convictions for serving officers are unlikely."
2021-01-27T10:30:28Z,global-development,Global development,From waste to play space: the project turning India's scrap into playgrounds,"Children of all ages cluster on top of tin cans painted in green, red and yellow embedded in the ground, others hang off a climbing frame made of rubber tubes. Others clamber energetically up a wall of colourfully painted repurposed tyres while some play on giant dominoes. “Tyres are versatile,” said Pooja Rai. “We use as many as 70 tyres in one playground to build seesaws and slides as well as elephants, octopuses and bikes that keep the children engaged.” In India, as in many countries, urban spaces are rarely safe for children to play. Gone are the days of creating a cricket ground in the street or playing in neighbourhoods with friends. Many children live in slums and others in crowded urban areas that have little access to space to play. According to a 2016 survey by Edelman Intelligence, young Indians have far fewer opportunities to play outdoors than their parents had. In 2015, architecture student Pooja Rai was crossing her college campus when she stopped to watch a group of children playing with broken concrete pipes.
It inspired her to get together with some friends to build the children a playground. Within two years, demand for play spaces was such that Rai started Anthill Creations, a not-for-profit based in Bengaluru, which builds sustainable, low-cost playscapes, using some of the 31 million tons of scrap material dumped annually at India’s landfill sites.
To date Anthill Creations has built 260 playgrounds in 18 states across India. “Our playgrounds are context specific and use local waste materials like old carts in Odisha. We source our tyres from the scrap market and sometimes have been donated tyres by companies like Michelin and Apollo Tyres,” says Rai. “Play is such an essential part of a child’s education, which not too many people are concerned about. We believe that every child, whether rich or poor, should get an equal opportunity and access to play, which is important for their holistic development. “These playgrounds are sustainable and can be built in just five days to a week, with the help of our team and volunteers. Since we often involve the local community in building the playground, there is a sense of ownership and responsibility,” she says. “What is remarkable about our playscapes is thatthey make for unstructured free play, where the children have a lot of freedom to innovate and invent new games and ways to use the equipment. We have worked with governments and cities in making spaces child-friendly,” says Rai.
In Himachal Pradesh, Anthill partnered with Recity, a social enterprise that helps local authorities handle urban waste. Meha Lahiri, the co-founder of Recity, says: “We are helped by corporates like Nestlé and we work with citizen groups and government bodies in tourist towns like Dalhousie, where the population swells with tourists who litter the town. We empower waste workers and suggest solutions for urban waste management.” Anthill has worked with many government schools and with the UN on a playground for Rohingya refugees, says Rai, whose team has also developed kits for children to use at home during the pandemic. “Before embarking on a project, we interact with the students for a few days and find out what they enjoy,” she says. “At [one] government primary school in Bengaluru, children started coming in earlier to play. Absenteeism came down and the children became more focused. One of those children is Asmitha, 11. “I am excited to go school and play at the new playground in the games period and in the evening too,” she says.

Reacting to the news that diplomats had been ordered to cut billions in aid over the next six weeks, experts warned that many lives would be lost and the UK stood to lose its reputation as a global “force for good”. “If these cuts are rushed through, inevitably poor decisions will result,” said Labour’s Sarah Champion, chair of the international development committee, which on Tuesday heard from Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) minister Dominic Raab. “The foreign secretary appeared before my committee this afternoon, and we heard how funding was being prioritised around the FCDO’s seven global challenges, but little was forthcoming on detail.” Ian Mitchell of the Center for Global Development warned that the speed of cuts, as aid is reduced from 0.7% to 0.5% of Britain’s gross national income, would create “major value-for-money risks”. “To grow the budget to 0.7% from 0.5% took four years, but the equivalent cut is being undertaken in a matter of weeks,” said Mitchell. “Bilateral aid programmes aren’t protected and some of them are with the world’s poorest countries, on issues such as basic health, so they’re relevant in fighting the Covid pandemic. This will be a major challenge for the UK’s poorest partners as they respond to the pandemic. “The second issue is that many programmes are multiyear, so ministers will likely be cutting short projects that will no longer see their intended outcomes: in infrastructure programmes, for example, that would mean projects don’t end up being built. We can expect ministers to be pushed into decisions that won’t protect the best programmes and will undermine value for money.” Sierra Leonean activist Chernor Bah, co-founder of feminist hub Purposeful, said cuts were a “gut punch that will crumble life-saving work”. “This is devastating news that will, as usual, hit the most marginalised in Sierra Leone and across the world,” said Bah.
“These cuts will have very real impacts on the lives and livelihoods of real girls and women: for our programmes in particular, they mean less access to social capital critical to girls’ survival, less access to education and livelihood opportunities, and less access to alternative life skills provision. It’s simply giving up on these girls and women and stating that their lives matter less, as they’re the first to be expended.” Oxfam’s head of policy Sam Nadel urged the government to reconsider. “Cutting aid in the middle of a pandemic when hundreds of millions are at risk of falling into poverty is a dereliction of Britain’s duty to the world’s poorest people and will cost lives,” he said. “If the government needs to raise money to balance the books it should ask those who have profited from the pandemic to pay more rather than cutting a vital lifeline that provides clean water, food and medicines.” Simon Starling of Bond, the international development network, said the government should “cut programmes that have been found not to deliver”. “I would hope the foreign secretary’s intention to be ‘right not quick’ applies as much to cutting UK aid programming in the midst of a pandemic, as to ensuring their plans to miss the UK’s 0.7% commitment are legal,” he added. And Concern Worldwide’s Danny Harvey said the cuts would reflect badly on the UK. “As the UK takes on the G7 presidency and hosts Cop26 this year, we want to see the UK leading the call to build back better. But it is hard to see how this is possible should there be such a dramatic reduction in aid spending and the impact this will have for the world’s poorest people.” Sarah-Jayne Clifton of the Jubilee Debt Campaign said that although she welcomed Raab’s comment that debt cancellation was a potential option, “it remains to be seen whether the government will actually deliver”. “The test for the government’s commitment on this will be this year’s G7 meeting,” she said. “The government must use this moment to unlock multilateral action on the Covid-19 debt crisis, most importantly action to ensure cancellation of debt owed to private lenders. The UK finance sector and legal system play a central role in the global sovereign debt regime.” She added that Britain needed to protect developing countries in debt crisis being sued in UK courts by private lenders ."
2021-01-26T18:44:49Z,global-development,Global development,UK diplomats told to cut up to 70% from overseas aid budget,"British diplomats have been instructed to find at least 50% cuts in UK overseas bilateral aid in the next few weeks in advance of the next financial year, the Labour party has said. Sarah Champion, the Labour chair of parliament’s international development select committee, said: “Our ambassadors have today been instructed by the Foreign Office to cut 50-70% from the aid budget.” Describing the speed of the planned cuts as catastrophic, she added: “There is no doubt that lives will be lost as a consequence and our global standing as humanitarians destroyed. Welcome to day 26 of ‘global Britain’.” The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, appearing in front of the international development select committee on Tuesday said he did not recognise the figure, and said the programmes to be cut had yet to be identified. Raab also published the overseas development spending budgets for 2020-21 for each Whitehall department totalling just under £10bn. Analysts from the Centre of Global Development said that £6.6bn of the £10bn aid budget was already committed, leaving only £3.5bn for bilateral aid, a cut of 60% on the equivalent bilateral aid figure for 2019. The cuts would have to be found in a matter of weeks, the centre said. The pre-allocated budget includes areas such as climate change, the CDC Group (formerly the Commonwealth Development Corporation) and continued commitments to multilateral aid bodies such as the European Union aid budget. So far officials have been more forthcoming about the parts of the budget that will be protected than those that will have to be cut. The current foreign aid budget is approximately £15bn. MPs on the committee made little progress in extracting any details on where the aid cuts would fall in the coming weeks. Raab said the strategic priorities were “overarching pursuit of poverty reduction: climate and biodiversity; Covid and global health security; girls’ education; science and research; defending open societies and resolving conflict; humanitarian assistance; and promoting trade”. He said: “We have chosen them as the things that really matter.” However, critics said the lengthy list hardly set out the areas that would be cut. Raab has also been warned by a former Conservative solicitor general, Lord Garnier, that he may be acting unlawfully in cutting the value of overseas aid from 0.7% to 0.5% of gross national income, a cut of nearly £4bn, without passing fresh legislation. “Until parliament changes that law on the statutory duty to meet the 0.7% target, the government must aim to hit it,” he wrote in a letter to the international aid select committee. The government has claimed it can reduce the target from 0.7% to 0.5% so long as the cut is temporary and required by the state of the economy. But Raab was unable to tell the committee when he would restore the target or the financial metrics that would determine when ministers could do so. He said the decision would involve a mixture of art and science. Ministers have promised a vote on the reduction that comes into force in weeks, and are bracing for a rebellion that may include the former prime minister, Theresa May. The aid committee has been told by campaigners that the effect of the slowdown in growth will mean a long-term cumulative cut in spending. Even if 0.7% had been maintained, due to the reduction in the size of the UK economy there would be a cumulative cut in the aid budget of about £5.2bn from 2020-25. The additional cut to 0.5 % will mean the cumulative cut from the aid budget will be likely to lead to about £25bn-£30bn being lost by 2025. Ministers are broadly confident the aid cuts are politically popular at a time of domestic belt-tightening, and the overall UK aid budget remains more than that of many G7 competitors."
2021-01-26T11:23:38Z,global-development,Global development,UK must cancel poor countries' debt or face Covid-19 'financial tsunami',"Billions of dollars of debt owed by poor countries must be permanently cancelled in order to stave off a “looming financial tsunami” caused by Covid-19 and the ensuing global recession, a cross-party committee of MPs has warned. Debt relief will not be enough to help the world’s most vulnerable economies as they face skyrocketing levels of hunger and unemployment, according to an inquiry into Covid-19’s secondary impacts in developing countries, published on Tuesday by the House of Commons international development committee (IDC). The publication coincides with the first appearance of the foreign secretary Dominic Rabb before the committee. Despite being granted roughly $5bn (£3.6bn) in debt suspension last year, more than 70 countries are still struggling to pay off $33bn under threat of being sued in UK courts if they default on their loans, the committee found.
The UK government’s decision to slash overseas aid from 0.7% to 0.5% of gross national income – which charities predicted could trigger huge numbers of deaths – has compounded the crisis by causing uncertainty for aid programmes across the globe, the IDC said. “Vulnerable communities have been fighting humanitarian injustices for too long – from poor healthcare to gender inequality, malnutrition to dire financial woes – and these have all been getting worse due to the pandemic,” said IDC chair Sarah Champion. “We must expose this shadow pandemic and recognise that long after coronavirus, the secondary impacts could be worse. The government needs to show leadership on this and commit to shore up our decades of investment in development,” she said. Beyond ever-rising levels of national debt, routine healthcare in some countries has ground to a halt, and people fear starvation and unemployment more than they do the pandemic. Covid-19, and its countermeasures, have increased rates of gender-based violence and child marriage, the inquiry found. While the IDC commended the UK’s role in extending the G20’s debt service suspension to 30 June, which allows the poorest countries to delay their government-to-government debt repayments, the group called on ministers to “consider options for the cancellation of debt”, and to persuade private lenders to join the G20 scheme. Some of the world’s biggest banks and asset management companies, among them HSBC and BlackRock, hold trillions of dollars in debts, yet to date have not offered any form of debt relief or cancellation. As English law governs 90% of the international sovereign bonds owed by countries eligible for the debt service suspension, the UK is in a unique position to send a message on debt cancellation, the IDC said. Melanie Ward, executive director of the International Rescue Committee, said: “The UK has a proud record of humanitarian leadership. If ‘Global Britain’ is to be more than a soundbite, then it is vital that the foreign secretary pledges to act on the findings of this report.” In its response to the IDC report, the government said it had committed up to £1.3bn of new aid to counter the impact of Covid-19, and to support the global effort to find and distribute a vaccine equitably. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has adapted more than 300 programmes to respond to the pandemic and has worked with the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Bank of England to provide technical assistance to countries on their Covid-19 response."
2021-01-26T07:15:56Z,global-development,Global development,Egypt’s political prisoners ‘denied healthcare and subject to reprisals’,"A decade after the uprising that overturned politics in Egypt, political prisoners are being targeted inside the country’s overcrowded prison system. Egypt’s prisons hold at least twice the number of people they were built for, with prisoners of conscience targeted by security forces and denied healthcare, according to Amnesty International. Prisoners of all kinds risk dying in custody because of the profound lack of basic care by the authorities, said the human rights organisation. “There is a sense that inside prisons, the guardians and especially the national security agency are trying to crush the revolution through targeting these individuals, undermining their right to health and dignity,” said Hussein Baoumi, of Amnesty International. The rights organisation gave details of reprisals against political prisoners, including solitary confinement for up to 23 hours a day, denial of family visits and of access to essential food packages delivered by relatives. It tracked the welfare of 67 detainees in 16 prisons across the country; 10 died in custody and two died shortly after release. A decade after protests ended the 30 year rule of autocrat Hosni Mubarak, many of the figures who spearheaded or participated in Egypt’s revolution now languish behind bars. Their detentions span the once-broad political coalition that banded together to topple Mubarak, from Islamist political prisoners to rights lawyers and ordinary citizens arrested on commonly-deployed charges of “spreading false news”, and seeking to overthrow the current regime.
Mary Lawlor, the UN special rapporteur on human rights defenders, recently condemned Egypt’s targeting of activists and bloggers, with many now languishing in pre-trial detention. “Not only are these human rights defenders, journalists and other civil society actors unduly targeted for their legitimate and peaceful defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms, they are wrongfully accused of belonging to terrorist organisations and portrayed as a national security threat under vague legal provisions,” she said. Since coming to power in a military coup in 2013, President Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi has purged all political opposition and targeted free speech, cracking down on the right to protest and even jailing a lone man who held a placard demanding he step down. Recent high-profile arrests include human rights workers, doctors who spoke out about Covid-19 and TikTok influencers. On 24 January, security forces detained cartoonist Ashraf Abdel Hamid after he helped create a short animation about the anniversary of the revolution. Amnesty said overcrowding is now commonplace, with large groups packed into tiny cells and many political prisoners held in facilities originally intended for those convicted of other crimes. On average a prisoner is afforded 1.1 sq metres of space, far less than the 3.4 sq metre minimum recommended by the International Red Cross. Sisi has long maintained that there are “no political prisoners in Egypt”, and the government does not release data on its labyrinthine prison system. According to the UN high commissioner on human rights, Egypt’s prison system holds at least double the 55,000 inmates the president has previously claimed.
For years rights groups have tried to identify the precise number of prisoners of conscience behind bars in Egypt. “It’s clear it’s in the tens of thousands, with political cases divided among those tried by the Supreme State Security Prosecution, the thousands in pre-trial detention and those repeatedly convicted in multiple cases, but collecting that information is extremely difficult,” said Baoumi. Groups like the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies also point to the widespread practice of “recycling cases” where prisoners are arbitrarily charged with new crimes to prevent their release. The practice is associated with the Supreme State Security Prosecution, a court that works in tandem with the National Security Agency to create what Amnesty described as “a parallel justice system”, targeting alleged enemies of the state. The growing numbers inside Egypt’s prisons have done little to change Sisi’s reception abroad. President Emmanuel Macron recently presented his Egyptian counterpart with France’s highest honour, the Légion d’honneur during a visit. British arms-tracking group Campaign Against the Arms Trade reported that the UK has licensed at least £218m of arms to Egypt since the uprising in 2011. “Now is an extremely important time for the international community,” said Baoumi, who stressed the need for pressure on Egypt to reveal more to international organisations about the conditions inside prisons. “Now is the time to do it, in order to save lives. Otherwise more people will die in prison.”"
2021-01-26T06:30:55Z,global-development,Global development,"Covid 'imperils family planning in poorest countries', says global project","Sixty million more women and girls in the world’s poorest countries are now using modern contraceptives, after an eight-year global effort to expand family planning services. But the FP2020 global partnership, launched in London in 2012, warned that the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting financial crisis imperils further progress. According to the FP2020’s final progress report, published on Tuesday, 320 million women and girls are using some form of modern contraception in the 69 focus countries, up from 260 million in 2012. The partnership had hoped to reach a figure of 120 million additional women and girls by 2020, but the increase was almost a third higher than had been projected over that period before the initiative began. The number of users across Africa – which had the lowest uptake in 2012 – has grown by 66%, from 40 million to more than 66 million women and girls. In central and west Africa, users doubled, while in eastern and southern Africa, the number grew by 70%. However, Covid-19 could cast a long shadow on progress. In April, two-thirds of the 103 countries surveyed by the World Health Organization reported disruptions to family planning services. The UN population fund (UNFPA) projected that as many as 47 million women and girls in 114 poorer countries could lose access to contraception.
While the worst-case scenario was averted through “partners working heroically to maintain services”, said Beth Schlachter, executive director of FP2020, the report noted that “the threat to reproductive health remains severe”, and would not be resolved soon. The pandemic had “unleashed a host of corollary effects: a global increase in gender-based violence and child marriage, a global drop in women’s workforce participation and girls’ school enrolment, and a global economic recession”, said the report. “The budgetary implications for family planning programmes are stark. Domestic government allocations and expenditures are threatened in numerous countries, and donors are already anticipating a decrease in their financial commitments or an inability to deliver on their commitments,” it said. “A pandemic-related global recession will have knock-on effects throughout the world, potentially imperilling family planning resources for years to come.” According to the report, before the pandemic the outlook for international funding for the next decade was that it would remain stagnant or even shrink. Schlachter said the partnership had “bent the curve of progress sharply upward”, not only in reaching more women and girls but in expanding the choice of contraceptive methods available to them, firming up supply chains and reaching more young people. Without Covid-19, the target figure could have been achieved over the next four or five years, she said. Funding was a concern, she said. “We are not sure that there is going to be additional funding.” National governments would need to prioritise family planning in their budgets. But advocates would also need to form new partnerships with groups working in other development sectors, Schlachter said, such as those trying to mitigate the climate crisis or halt biodiversity loss. “We have to expand aspirations, how we work with other partners,” she said. “We know that when women and girls use contraceptives they generally have smaller families. A rights-based approach to family planning sets us up for world where women are making decisions … that has a positive impact on population growth, climate change and on biodiversity.” On Tuesday, the FP2020 will update its name to FP2030 and the number of countries involved will increase."
2021-01-25T18:47:03Z,global-development,Global development,Mexico president rebuked for careless response to Covid after testing positive,"Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, declared at the weekend that his country was nearing the end of the coronavirus crisis, telling supporters that “little lights” at the end of the tunnel could already be seen. The next day he tested positive for Covid-19, throwing the country into tumult – and prompting fresh criticisms of his cavalier response to a disease that has killed nearly 150,000 citizens.
Throughout the pandemic, López Obrador – popularly known as Amlo – has been condemned for his seemingly carefree behaviour: he has consistently downplayed the severity of the crisis, continued to tour the country and has has rarely been seen wearing a mask. “It’s as if Amlo sought out [infection],” said Rodolfo Soriano-Núñez, a Mexico City sociologist, using a common reference for the president. “He’s been really careless.” The diagnosis arrived at a grim moment for Mexico. The daily death toll has topped more than 1,000 for much of January, and Mexico is is expected to overtake India shortly to become third on the list of hardest-hit countries. The president’s political allies responded to his positive test with outpourings of support for a president who has remained popular, in spite of the pandemic’s awful impact. Some of the expressions descended into fanaticism – “Why not give me Covid instead of Andrés Manuel,” tweeted Beatriz Castillo, a pro-Amlo writer. On social media, Amlo supporters piled on to rebuke posts observing Amlo’s refusal to wear a mask. “Most Amlo supporters – though not all of them – seem to be much more concerned with defending him than they are about the soundness of his policies to protect the health of their fellow Mexicans,” said Carlos Bravo Regidor, a professor at the Centre for Research and Teaching in Economics. “There is not even a shadow of civic duty or critical consciousness in their reactions. They are just militants and sycophants.” Amlo announced his positive test Sunday night after flying back from the north-central city of San Luis Potosí. Videos on social media showed him boarding the plane like any other passenger, raising questions over when the president received his diagnosis during a busy day of public events and meetings. The president, who has a history of cardiac issues and was a heavy smoker before he suffered a massive heart attack in 2013, said he has “light symptoms” and was receiving medical attention. He has insisted his health has been fine since taking office and he speaks often of avoiding bad habits like eating junk food. Despite his age and high blood pressure, López Obrador has not received a vaccine shot, although Mexico has received batches of Pfizer-BioNTech doses. He promised to continue working, though for the first time in two years he skipped his daily morning press conference which he normally uses to rebut criticism and spreading sunny messages that Mexico has already passed the worst.
His stand-in at Monday’s press conference was interior minister Olga Sánchez Cordero who said Amlo was feeling well and remains firmly in charge of the government. “He will recover soon,” said Sánchez Cordero, who was not wearing a mask. Senior officials were tested and several went into self-isolation after the diagnosis. “The reality is they must be very worried about his health,” Bárbara González, a political analyst in Monterrey, said of the president’s supporters. “There’s no ‘Obradorismo’ without Obrador.”"
2021-01-25T07:45:08Z,global-development,Global development,'The lockdown was political': Chad under strain ahead of election,"For Abdulgadir Sanousi the decision to lock down the capital of Chad was “a nightmare”. His work driving from N’Djamena to Moundou in the south four times a week dried up overnight. This month any work has involved bribing police to let him through the checkpoints at N’Djamena’s four main entry points. “The situation is just a nightmare for us. We are faced with difficulties by the police. In order to deal with them you need to bribe them, if not they would confiscate your vehicle,” says 27-year-old Sanousi. President Idriss Déby locked down the city of around a million inhabitants on 1 January. Gatherings and public transport stopped, and schools, places of worship and restaurants closed. Markets, where the majority of the population make a living, also had to shut down. The airport closed except for cargo and the city was put under a dusk to dawn curfew. On Thursday some restrictions on travel were eased, but the curfew remains in the central African country, which has recorded just over 3,000 cases and 114 deaths since the pandemic was declared last year. The government supplied food staples to some neighbourhoods, says Sanousi: “They gave us very little stuff, even less than one meal a day.
“Living in this country is very expensive. You need to wake up very early in the morning and work really hard just for food and basics. Imagine on top of that they locked down the city. People here do not think there’s coronavirus, even if there is, it’s not that severe.” According to the UN World Food Programme (WPF), 66% of Chadians live in severe poverty and one in three are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. The oil-rich country ranked 187th out of 189 countries in the 2019 human development index. In a briefing paper published this week, the WFP said levels of malnutrition were a concern. But there have been no reported disruptions to aid deliveries during lockdown. “We only have one meal a day,” says Madina Abdullah, who helps her mother sell bakhoor (woodchip soaked in oils) at a N’Djamena market. “These days my daughters and I have to wait for my mother all day so that she could bring us some food from the market. We only have dinner.” Ahmed Osman, a father of four, who sells secondhand clothes, fears another lockdown. “There are not many buyers, we don’t sell much. Nobody wants to waste their money on clothes, people want to keep that for food, there might be another lockdown at any time. The government here does it without any warning.” Opposition parties have accused the government of using lockdown to interfere with election campaigning ahead of the presidential vote scheduled for April. Déby, who seized power in 1990, began his campaign rallies before the measures were introduced, visiting most of the main cities outside N’Djamena. “He did his rallies and locked the city down to prevent us from doing the same thing,” says Yacine Sakin, a member of the Reformist party, part of an opposition coalition that aims to put forward a candidate in the election. “The lockdown here is a totally political action. It is not about the coronavirus, the regime has no support from the public and they know that, and they simply want to restrict the freedom of movement of the people.”
It’s not just people living in the capital who have been hit by the lockdown. Chad is home to more than 478,000 refugees, the vast majority from Sudan, and is expecting an increase in refugees from Central African Republic following this month’s election violence. A Sudanese refugee who has lived in eastern Chad since leaving Sudan in 2004 told the Guardian that he usually travels to N’Djamena regularly for medical checkups, but has been unable to make the journey because of the lockdown. Haroun Yahya, a 41-year-old father of 14, was shot in Darfur by Janjaweed militia and has multiple leg injuries. “I used to travel to the capital regularly with the help of the UN to get treatment, now I have been depending on local medicines to ease my pain,” he says."
2021-01-25T07:15:08Z,global-development,Global development,'Nowhere is safe': Colombia confronts alarming surge in femicides,"When authorities pulled the lifeless body of four-year-old María Ángel Molina out of a river in rural Colombia on 13 January, the South American country mourned what was the 14th documented case of femicide this year. Her murderer, Juan Carlos Galvis, also kidnapped María’s sister, and later admitted to authorities that he committed the brutal crimes in order to punish the girls’ mother for seeing another man. With five more femicides, murders directly related to the victim’s gender, documented since María’s killing – 18 in total, with a further 13 to be verified – rights groups are worried about the safety of women and girls once again forced indoors with abusive men amid a new round of strict lockdowns to curb coronavirus outbreaks. “Sadly when we speak about violence against women in Colombia, there isn’t a single place that we can call ‘safe’,” said Juliana Castillo Rodas, who works with the Femicide Foundation Colombia, an NGO that provides support for women and tracks gender-based violence. “But what we can say is that the home has become one of the most dangerous places for women.” Throughout last year – which involved six months of lockdown – the foundation confirmed 229 femicides, of which 35 were girls, and is trying to verify a further 260 cases of violent deaths of women and girls that could be defined as femicides. While a rise in confirmed cases did not occur, rights groups say the numbers are probably much higher, with cases often unreported by women for fear of reprisal. Women are also less likely to reach out for help when trapped at home with their abusers. When authorities are contacted, they are often unresponsive.
“We’re worried that when women inform authorities, they are not listened to by the state or its institutions,” Castillo said. “We may not have noted a rise in cases last year, though we did see an increase in the number of violent acts against women, such as disappearances, immolations and dismembering, alongside sexual violence.” Measures such as better gender education and safer, well-lit cities could help make Colombia safer for women, Castillo said. Other activists say coronavirus measures such as bans on alcohol sales and curfews that limit parties and social gatherings can reduce some risks for women and girls who live with abusive men.
Colombia’s vice-president, Marta Lucía Ramírez, addressed the alarming situation for women on Tuesday while visiting Medellín, the country’s second city. “We have to reach zero femicides,” she said in a speech announcing opportunity programmes for women. “We have to end machismo and any kind of violence against women.” Horrifying murders of women and girls are not uncommon in Colombia, and are sometimes committed by authority figures. Last June, scandal engulfed the military after seven soldiers gang-raped a 13-year-old indigenous girl. “We know that this is not an isolated issue, it is structural,” said Aida Quilcue, at the time a human rights adviser at the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (ONIC). Meanwhile, the country is still reckoning with sexual violence committed during the country’s decades-long civil war with leftist rebel group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). A special tribunal set up following a 2016 peace deal is working through thousands of cases. Yet with each horrific case that makes headlines, little is done to change the way Colombian society views women, activists say. “Femicide is the last recourse that an abuser has, but before that comes symbolic, sexual and economic violence and threats,” said Daniela Lozano, an activist working on gender-based violence in the capital Bogotá. “We need to ask ourselves about why these femicides keep happening, though the answer is clear: it’s the way men view women in Colombia; it is machismo.”"
2021-01-24T10:30:43Z,global-development,Global development,Mexico faces challenge to light-touch Covid approach as US restricts travel,"New US coronavirus travel restrictions are likely to have an outsized impact on Mexico, which is also struggling with an uncontrolled outbreak of the virus and record-breaking deaths.
Among Joe Biden’s flurry of executive orders on Thursday was a new set of rules requiring all travelers entering the US by sea, air or land to show proof of a recent negative coronavirus test and self-quarantine or self-isolate after entry. The executive action also instructs federal officials to work with the governments of Mexico and Canada to draw up a coordinated plan for border crossings. Until now, Mexico has also been a world outlier in refusing to implement restrictions on international air passengers, as President Andrés Manuel López Obrador pushes a light-touch response to the pandemic. Meanwhile, hospitals have been overwhelmed by surging case numbers, and this week Mexico set two daily coronavirus death records. But even as fatalities soared, the country has cornered the market in offering restriction-free travel to international tourists. During the winter holidays foreign and domestic tourists flocked to beach resorts and other prime destinations. The new US rules – and similar measures introduced this month by Canada – may finally nudge Mexican policymakers to embrace the science – or face a loss of tourism and international mobility. But developing a coordinated approach with Mexico may prove difficult: López Obrador has consistently downplayed the severity of the pandemic, and after building an unexpectedly positive relationship with Donald Trump, has been standoffish with the incoming US administration.
Mexican health officials have refused to implement a number of evidence-based pandemic response measures, such as mass testing. (Despite the severity of its outbreak, Mexico has one of the lowest testing rates in the world.) Dr Laurie Ann Ximénez-Fyvie, director of the Molecular Genetics Laboratory at Mexico’s Autonomous National University (Unam), believes the country’s failure to establish an adequate testing network will make complying with new US travel requirements a challenge. “Simply meeting the demand of passengers traveling abroad is going to be a terrible problem when testing capacity isn’t up to the necessary level,” Ximénez-Fyvie said. “The numbers just don’t add up because the testing capacity in Mexico is far too low.” Together the US and Canada make up the lion’s share of Mexico’s economically important international tourism sector. Mexico is also home to the largest population of US citizens living abroad. Travelers to Mexico must fill out a health questionnaire, but there are no testing requirements for entry, nor rules for quarantine upon arrival. Without a government lead, private companies are scrambling to meet demand. Federal data shows the state of Quintana Roo – home to Cancún – usually only reports hundreds of test results a day. Adolfo Castro, CEO of Aeropuertos del Sureste (Asur), which operates the tourist hub’s busy international airport, noted the new rule would significantly and rapidly increase demand. “If you add to the normal situation 15,000 [air passengers] a day, then you have to do something and you have to react.” The Quintana Roo state government has recently opened temporary testing sites in the resort cities of Cancún, Playa del Carmen and Tulum. Castro’s company is in talks with local hotels to help passengers get tested in the 72-hour window before their departure flights. He is also looking for an accredited lab to conduct on-site antigen testing at the airport. The new testing requirements have also fueled speculation that non-accredited labs or doctors who cater to tourist demands for prescriptions may create a new black market in falsified test results or medical documentation. Dr Ximénez-Fyvie said Mexico’s extensive networks of public and private labs could easily cover the demand for ramped-up testing, but what was lacking were the materials for processing the tests and political will to coordinate the effort. “It’s not that we don’t have the resources or the abilities or the infrastructure,” said Ximénez-Fyvie. “The problem here has been the lack of willingness to see that it gets done.”"

Renee Bach founded the now defunct Serving His Children (SHC) centre in Jinja, a city in east Uganda, where the families took their children, three of whom later died. Documents, endorsed by Jinja high court this month after being filed last year, say the children died after receiving treatment at the centre, and that a fourth child who had surgery there has an impaired limb and other health problems.
At least 105 children died at the centre over several years. The lawsuit is seeking compensation for the four families, as well as an order for Bach to publicly apologise, “including acknowledgment of the facts and acceptance of the responsibility for the violation of the right to appropriate healthcare and life of the children that she attended to”. The suit also requests the court to order criminal sanctions against Bach. Lukiya Nakaja, whose daughter Eva died in 2013, said: “I was angry when I found out Renee is not a doctor.” In her affidavit, Nakaja claims Bach connected Eva to oxygen, gave the child tablets and inserted tubes into her nose without explanation. Nakaja told the Guardian her marriage fell apart after Eva’s death and she struggles to support her family. Last year Bach settled a civil case involving the mothers of two children who died after receiving care at SHC. Without admitting liability, Bach and SHC agreed to pay Zubeda Gimbo and Annet Kakai 35m Uganda shillings (£7,335) each in damages. SHC and Bach’s lawyer, David Gibbs, have always vigorously defended Bach’s work. In a statement last year, SHC denied that Bach passed herself off as a doctor, but admitted she regularly assisted in “crisis situations” using “skills” learned from Ugandan healthcare professionals. The Guardian approached Gibbs for comment on the latest action. Robert Okot, one of the lawyers representing the four families in the new case, said: “We hope there will be justice for these affected families, and that it will be a deterrent measure for people who abuse development work.”"
2021-01-22T10:36:14Z,global-development,Global development,"Judge's remarks made mother 'fearful' for herself and her child, hearing told","A family court judge has come under fire for “wholly inappropriate” comments made to a young mother during a private hearing on child contact arrangements. Judge Richard Scarratt made the mother “fearful” and put pressure on her to accept that the child have contact with her father, a barrister representing the mother has claimed. A landmark hearing – featuring four linked appeals concerning domestic abuse cases in the family courts for England and Wales – was told on Wednesday how the mother sobbed as Scarratt told her that if the case kept “going on and on” the child could be taken from her, put in care and adopted. An audio recording of Scarratt’s remarks on 18 March 2019 was heard by appeal judges Lady Justice King, Sir Andrew McFarlane and Lord Justice Holroyde. Amanda Weston QC, representing the mother, one of four women challenging decisions made about child contact in the past 18 months where there were allegations against the fathers of rape and coercive control, said: “The judge in this case made a number of statements which were wholly inappropriate and were such as to pressure the mother and make her fearful for her and for her child in the event she did not bow to the judge’s indication that a consent arrangement should be reached.” The court was told that safeguarding checks had been carried out but had not been taken into account in August 2019 when a final order was made. Allegations of sexual assault by “three different females” had been made against the father, Weston said. One was by a 16-year-old at his place of work. He was later dismissed. The barrister said Scarratt had failed to consider a social worker’s report expressing concerns. Weston said the mother’s rape allegations against the man, “taken with the social worker’s recommendation … should have raised very serious red flags and making the order without resolving it, or making an analysis of the impact it might have on the risk to the child, in my submission led him [Scarratt] to an error of law”. Lawyers representing the father told the court the grounds for appeal were “fundamentally misleading” because the court had been “explicitly” invited not to make findings [on the allegations] by both parties. Teertha Gupta QC conceded the judge had been “outspoken” but said that his comments related to an instance of alleged drug use by the mother.
The court was told by the woman’s barrister that she had had a drug test that was negative – but had taken drugs on one occasion after being coerced by the father. Gupta said police had decided not to prosecute the father for rape and that the man, who denies all the allegations, had not seen his child for a year. He said the father had also made domestic abuse allegations. Sir Andrew McFarlane said Scarratt’s remarks were of “significant concern” but that “it doesn’t follow as night follows day that the order in August must be set aside”. Earlier the court heard the appeal of a different woman seeking a retrial in relation to a case heard by Judge Tolson – whose decisions are being challenged in two of the four linked appeals. In this case Weston said her client was not opposed to the father having child contact but that the court should have made findings that took note of the father’s angry outbursts and what impact these could have on the child. MacFarlane said not all the allegations raised had been on the schedule put before Tolson. Denise Gilling QC, for the father, urged the appeal judges to uphold the original decision, saying it was “abundantly clear” Tolson had followed current guidance on treatment of vulnerable witnesses. The judges retired on Thursday to consider their findings."
2021-01-22T07:45:41Z,global-development,Global development,The teenage taekwondo trainer fighting child marriage in Zimbabwe – photo essay,"It is 11am on a Sunday and Natsiraishe Maritsa, 17, is running through some workout drills with a group of sweating teenage girls from her neighbourhood in Epworth, a poor township nine miles (15km) south-east of the capital, Harare. On a normal Sunday, Maritsa and her friends would be attending church, but the strict 30-day lockdown imposed by the government earlier this month has banned religious gatherings – so it’s time to catch up on a taekwondo training session. Maritsa shouts instructions as the group punch, kick and break a sweat in the morning sun in her yard, where she has created a makeshift training ground.
Natsiraishe Maritsa runs through taekwondo stretching drills at her family home in Epworth. Among those attending are young mothers and girls who were forced into child marriages, a practice common in Epworth and across Zimbabwe, where many under the age of 16 are married off by poor families who would otherwise struggle to provide for them. According to Girls Not Brides, which campaigns for an end to child marriages, about 34% of girls in Zimbabwe are married before they are 18 while 5% are married before they are 15.
Maritsa works with young children from her community. Maritsa keeps a journal of heart-rending testimonies from some of the teen mothers who confide in her about their abusive marriages. One of her most promising taekwondo students was recently stopped from attending training sessions by her husband. “The girls are being abused. There is one lady who told me that she was stabbed with a knife by her husband and was threatened with death,” Maritsa says. After losing most of her friends to early marriages from the age of 13, Maritsa looked for ways to raise awareness about the dangers of the practice.
Maritsa practises at home. “I decided to do something for the girl child. I had to create a foundation so that they grow up in a better environment. Most of my friends got married due to poverty and others were forced by their guardians because their parents had died,” she says. According to girls’ rights organisations, teenage pregnancies and marriages have been rising since Zimbabwe announced its first lockdown in March last year. The situation has been worsened by the protracted closure of schools and growing poverty, with families’ livelihoods suffering amid harsh economic conditions. Marrying off their young daughters is the easy way out. Zimbabwe outlawed marriage for girls under the age of 18 in 2016, but the practice has continued and become more acceptable in poorer communities such as Epworth.
Maritsa’s neighbourhood. In 2018, Maritsa set up her foundation, Underaged People’s Auditorium, which seeks to stop more children becoming brides, through a combination of taekwondo and discussions about the dangers of early marriage. With scant resources, the organisation has helped raise awareness of the dangers of child marriage for 40 teenage mothers and young women. Driven by her desire to see an end to early marriages, Maritsa has used the lockdown to engage parents. She has vowed to use her influence in taekwondo to further the campaign. In 2019 she won two gold medals at the Epworth Junior Cadet Championships and a silver medal at the Korean Ambassador trophy. “A lot of people look down on Epworth, but I would like the world to know that something big can come out of a despised place,” Maritsa says. Having started taekwondo at the age of five, Maritsa has inspired her 10-year-old sister to take up the sport with the help of their father – a taekwondo and fitness enthusiast.
Family life revolves around taekwondo in a household where everyone is an enthusiast. Maritsa dreams of joining the Zimbabwe air force as an armament engineer and fancies a shot at representing her country in the sport. “I took taekwondo as a sport because I want to take part in taekwondo [at the] Olympics. Although Covid-19 has slowed me down in terms of my training, I believe I can still make it,” Maritsa says, showing off her medals in the family lounge. Her mother, Ndanatseyi Karigundu, says her daughter’s struggle against child marriage should be taken up by every adult in Epworth.
Maritsa with her brothers and sister and their mother. “Adults must report what is happening within the community, but [that] is something that is not happening because of poverty. Parents are consenting to their little girls’ marriages and it is sad. It is not good for parents to accept lobola [dowry] for the young girls,” Karigundu says. Mainly made up of families who migrated from rural areas in the early 1990s looking for work, Epworth’s girls are often married off to richer men or into polygamy. Inspired by their daughter’s passion to see an end to child marriage, Maritsa’s parents have joined the campaign. They say, however, that it has been a significant task to change deep-rooted attitudes. “We always hear sad stories here when Natsi is conducting her sessions. If we had resources, we would help them rebuild their lives. I am planning to help them start a soap-making business so that they can grow from there,” says her father, Richard Maritsa.
Maritsa’s parents, Richard and Ndanatseyi; Desire Mtunzi, 17: ‘I think child marriages are not good for the girl child.’ One of Maritsa’s students, 17-year-old Desire Mtunzi, agrees: “I have been coming for the sessions for about three months. It helps me keep fit and I learn about early marriages. I think child marriages are not good for the girl child.” Maritsa is also determined to get teenage mothers back into school. In Mbare, southern Harare, a group of young mothers gather for a support session at a community centre. Most of them dropped out of school after becoming pregnant. At sessions organised by nonprofit group Ignite Youth girls are encouraged to create vision boards and set achievable targets for themselves, which include returning to school. An initiative that started as a Covid-19 response has become a life changing experience.
Master and pupils. Emily Nderezima, 17, who could not finish her O-levels after becoming pregnant, oozes confidence after her first training. “I have learned how to take responsibility as a mum. I have the power and strength to achieve my goals,” she says. Ignite Youth founder Tadzi Madzima says the programme is aimed at dealing with stigma associated with teenage pregnancy. Although Zimbabwean law now prevents pregnant girls being expelled from school, society still stigmatises them, she says. “As much as we applaud the fact that teen mums can continue with their education after giving birth, a lot [is still needed] to educate parents, teachers and communities on how stigmatisation of teen mums is unfair and detrimental to their future.”"
2021-01-21T10:30:28Z,global-development,Global development,Honduras lawmakers seek to lock in ban on abortion for ever,"Legislators in Honduras are pushing a constitutional reform through Congress that would make it virtually impossible to legalise abortion in the country – now or in the future.
The measure, called a “shield against abortion” by its proponents, comes in response to the feminist “green wave” movement sweeping across Latin America that recently achieved its biggest victory yet with the legalisation of abortion in Argentina. “It’s a shield to stop the green wave,” said Cristina Alvarado, a representative of the Women’s Movement for Peace. “In Honduras there is an absolute violation of the reproductive rights of women and girls.” Honduras is one of four countries in Latin America that prohibits abortion under any circumstance, and the only one to also prohibit emergency contraceptives, even in the case of rape. The new measure, which is likely to pass within the next week, would require at least three-quarters of Congress to vote in favour of modifying the country’s abortion law for any changes to be enacted, raising the vote threshold above what is normally necessary for constitutional reforms to a level that would be almost impossible to overcome. It sets a precedent that activists fear could be replicated across the region to halt the advance of reproductive rights for women. “[The legislators] want to shield against the possibility of future legislation that would decriminalise abortion,” said Alvarado. In 2017, legislators voted on a reform that would have decriminalised abortion in the case of rape or incest, when the mother’s life is at risk and when the foetus could not survive outside the womb. But only eight of 128 legislators voted in favor. “We live in an extremely conservative society,” said Beatriz Valle, a former legislator for the center-left Libre party who was one of those who voted in favor of decriminalisation. “It’s a matter of public health, but the people don’t want to see it that way.” The constitutional reform would also exclude the possibility of a court ruling, such as Roe v Wade in the United States, or the passing of a new constitution, to overturn the prohibition. Pro-choice activists say that the reform will not prevent abortions, but rather maintain the status quo in which many women – particularly those who cannot afford to simply fly to another country where the practice is legal – are obliged to seek out abortions in unsafe conditions. “There have been cases where once you do the physical examination you find coins or even nails in the vaginal cavity,” said an OB/GYN at a local public hospital. He added that his hospital attends to roughly 150 miscarriages a month, many of whom are teenage girls who he suspects may have aborted. Performing or undergoing an abortion in Honduras carries a penalty of three to six years in jail, but charges are rarely filed. The confinement that came with the Covid-19 pandemic has only worsened conditions for women in the country, which suffers the highest rate of femicide in Latin America and endemic sexual violence.
“We closed 2020 with more than 100,000 calls to 911 from women suffering domestic violence,” said Alvarado. “Of those calls, only 2.5% resulted in criminal complaints.” Even fewer resulted in a conviction. Meanwhile, the number of 10- to 14-year-old girls who gave birth in 2020 increased to more than 800 nationwide, an average of 16 a week, according to Alvarado, in a country with a population similar to that of London. Despite the seemingly insurmountable opposition to progress on reproductive rights for women, feminist activists in Honduras find inspiration in the accomplishments achieved by their green wave counterparts across Latin America and are resolved to continue to fight. “We are going to keep fighting for the right to decide,” said Alvarado. “I think that if there’s something that we can learn from the Argentinians it’s to go step-by-step. It took Argentina over 30 years.”"
2021-01-21T07:15:24Z,global-development,Global development,Northern Mozambique in crisis as thousands flee escalating conflict,"Northern Mozambique has lurched into a humanitarian crisis as growing numbers of people have lost their homes amid escalating conflict. Fighting in the northern province of Cabo Delgado displaced more than 500,000 people last year and on Wednesday UN agencies said they were deeply worried about the current situation and called for the international community to do more to help. A cholera outbreak has also been reported in the region with the arrival of the rainy season. “The situation in Cabo Delgado is dire, it’s a humanitarian crisis, the international community cannot let the situation continue like this,” said Valentin Tapsoba, director of UNHCR in southern Africa. He said 90% of those displaced had been taken in or housed by sympathetic local people but were living in cramped conditions, with several families often sharing small spaces, sleeping on floors and sharing a single toilet. The Isis-linked militant group Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jamaa escalated its insurgency in Cabo Delgado last year, seizing the key port town Mocímboa da Praia in August, and an increasing number of people have fled both the militants and government forces, according to activists. Already unable to reach those stuck in areas controlled by the militants, especially some parts of the coast, UN representatives said a visit to Cabo Delgado in December highlighted how much support people needed. “The number of [those] internally displaced has also increased because people know the rains are coming and they know they will be cut off,” said the UN’s resident coordinator in Mozambique, Myrta Kaulard. “The needs are very important, we are extremely worried by the lack of resources we have. We launched an appeal but our capacity to help is extremely limited.”
The UN called for $254m (£185m) in December, which would support 1.1 million people, including the host communities. The World Food Programme warned earlier this month that its resources were stretched and that it could be forced to reduce aid, potentially increasing tensions, unless more support was given. Kaulard also warned that the rains could exacerbate a cholera breakout in Cabo Delgado that authorities are struggling to contain. UN representatives said the displaced people had requested long-term support for livelihoods, education and especially the health sector, which was already stretched by Covid-19 and Cyclone Kenneth in 2019. They said plans were being made to relocate displaced people to sites with better shelter and that they had asked the government to provide land that would allow them to return to farming. “The populations want to go back to their own activities. We discussed with the local authorities the possibility of getting free land given. They may not be there for a few weeks or a few months, they may be there for a few years,” said Patrice Talla, regional director for the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization."
2021-01-21T06:30:23Z,global-development,Global development,Shipwreck claims the lives of at least 43 migrants off the coast of Libya,"At least 43 people have been killed after a boat carrying migrants capsized off the Libyan coast, the UN said on Wednesday. Ten people survived the shipwreck, which happened after the boat’s engine failed a few hours after departing the coastal city Zawiya, west of the capital Tripoli, on Tuesday morning. A joint statement by the UN’s migration and refugee agencies said it was the first shipwreck involving migrants in the central Mediterranean this year. Hundreds died in similar incidents in 2020. A spokesperson for Alarm Phone, which communicates with migrants and refugees in distress at sea, said the incident was a result of European border policy. “We have a huge rescue gap because most of the rescue vessels are under administrative detention or under some kind of investigation in Europe so most can’t go out to sea,” they said. They said the only rescue NGO currently able to operate was SOS Méditerranée, and it faces challenges in reaching migrants. In a separate incident on Wednesday the NGO said it was unable to rescue 48 people stranded on another inflatable boat before the Libyan coastguard returned them to Libya. The interception, criticised for returning the migrants to dangerous environments, was observed by an aircraft operated by rescue group Sea-Watch, whose own rescue ships are unable to go to sea. SOS Méditerranée’s Ocean Viking was only able to return to sea on 11 January, six months after it had been detained by Italian authorities.
Currently six NGO ships are unable to operate, Alarm Phone said. In April last year Italy declared its ports “unsafe” for arrival due to the Covid-19 outbreak and said it would not accept migrants. The UN said attitudes needed to change on migrants from the Mediterranean, including an end to the policy of returning them to unsafe countries. “This loss of life highlights once more the need for reactivation of state-led search and rescue operations, a gap NGO and commercial vessels are trying to fill despite their limited resources,” the statement said. The EU has been accused by rights groups of condemning refugees and migrants to death in the Mediterranean through its border policies and by supporting Libyan militias to intercept and return boats to the coast. The EU border agency Frontex was accused in October of being involved in illegal pushbacks to sea by member states. In November it announced it would launch a committee to evaluate its surveillance on the Mediterranean."
2021-01-20T10:00:44Z,global-development,Global development,'It gives us hope': migrants stranded in Mexico buoyed by prospect of Biden reform,"Selma López, 31, has spent nearly a year holed up in a two-room house not far from Mexico’s border with the US, along with her 11-year-old son Darikson and another woman who also made the long journey from Honduras in search of a new life.
They are among thousands of people stranded south of the frontier by a Trump administration policy known as migrant protection protocols (MPP), which obliges asylum seekers to await their court hearings in some of Mexico’s most dangerous cities, instead of in the US. Children and adults have been raped, kidnapped and murdered while awaiting their court date. In Piedras Negras, police routinely harass migrants, said López. Earlier this week, a mysterious white car followed her as she walked to the store. And as a Garifuna woman, she has suffered overt racism and anti-Black insults from locals. But López’s mood brightens when conversation turned to the US presidential inauguration – and what it might mean for her and thousands of others. “We’re encouraged and feeling a little hopeful,” said López, who fled northern Honduras after gangsters threatened to kill Darikson for not making protection payments. “It’s giving us a little hope that we can at least enter the US and fight our cases there.”
Joe Biden has promised to do away with MPP and restore the asylum process, raising hopes among MPP participants that their claims will be treated seriously – and that they won’t have to risk their lives while waiting. Biden plans to restore asylum and refugee programs and officials from the incoming administration say MPP will be addressed in an executive order in the near future. But they cautioned it could take months to address all the changes to the immigration system introduced by Trump. Activists on the border have tried to temper migrants’ enthusiasm. “They think things are going change immediately. I’m trying to make them understand it’s not that easy,“ said Israel Rodríguez, a Baptist pastor, who feeds migrants in Piedras Negras. Piedras Negras, a city of factories opposite Eagle Pass, Texas, attracted asylum seekers because of safety perceptions, according to Rodrigúez. But MPP participants must attend hearings in Laredo, Texas, a journey of 125 miles through cartel territory.
The threats do not just come from criminals: police in Piedras Negras regularly detain and extort migrants – and even destroy immigration documents. The local government has closed down migrant shelters under the pretext of the coronavirus and in December ordered them from providing hot meals for migrants left homeless. “They’re making charity illegal,” said Dominican brother Obed Cuellar, director of a diocesan migrant shelter. “There’s a way of thinking here that migrants come to destroy the city or make it dirty … or they’re taking our jobs.” Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, came to office promising not to do the US’s “dirty work” on migration matters. But he immediately went along with the MPP scheme and promised to provide the participants and their children with access to health and education, employment opportunities and shelter. Lawyers and activists say little of that help has materialized, but volunteers from Mexico and the US have provided MPP participants with everything from food and clothing to legal and medical advice. Within Mexico, MPP largely went unnoticed as its participants were largely out of sight and out of mind. But a lawyer representing a number of MPP participants said the program served its purpose for the Trump administration, however. “The cornerstone of MPP is xenophobia. And it worked because 68,000 people were kept out of the US,” said Charlene D’Cruz, a border fellow for Lawyers for Good Government’s Project Corazon. “What MPP did was show people stuck at the border and that was enough for Trump’s base to say that he did what he set out to do: keep all the ‘Mexican rapists’ out.” The pictures from Matamoros – tucked into the extreme north-east corner of Mexico – were at times shocking as MPP participants lived in the squalor of a tent camp along the Rio Grande.
The camp has been flooded out, infested with snakes and insects and eventually infiltrated by criminal groups – which charge $500 for permission to cross the frontier and inflict severe beatings on those not paying. “My son [age five] saw someone being beaten by the river … He’s traumatized,” said Marlen, 24,a Salvadoran asylum seeker. But people at the camp felt they had particular reason for optimism: in December 2019 Jill Biden came here and helped serve meals to the migrants. “This is the only place along the border the now first lady visited. That’s why they’re so hopeful,” said Juan Sierra. “We think Biden is going to push an immigration reform,” said José Luis Guerra, a skinny Cuban. “With Trump, there wasn’t any reason for hope.” Additional reporting by Amanda Holpuch"
2021-01-20T07:15:13Z,global-development,Global development,‘People are hungry’: why Tunisia's youth are taking to the streets,"Ettadhamen, a marginalised district on the outskirts of Tunis, wears unrest well. Over the weekend and into this week, violent protests have dominated life in this overlooked and restive place. The district is not unique. Over the past few days, protests have erupted in working-class neighbourhoods in at least 15 locations across Tunisia, in response to declining living conditions, poverty and endemic unemployment, especially among the country’s young people. More than 600 people have been arrested so far, most between the ages of 15 and 25, and the army has been deployed to protect government buildings.
On Tuesday, about 200 demonstrators marched in central Tunis, calling for the release of those detained and an end to police violence. Amnesty International has already called for restraint from the police after video footage emerged of officers appearing to beat protesters during clashes. Other video clips have emerged with shaky footage showing young people battling teargas and a well organised police force with fireworks and stones. One clip purports to show a police officer shooting teargas into a man’s home. In an unscheduled television address on Tuesday evening, Hichem Mechichi, the prime minister, offered the protesters understanding, but insisted the law would continue to be enforced. Touring a suburb in Ariana, Tunis, on Monday, President Kais Saied called for calm and asked young people to refrain from targeting people or property. Everyone the Guardian spoke to in Ettadhamen this week voiced their frustration at how the government and the country’s media has focused on the violence and looting, rather than the reasons behind the protests.
Yassine* works in his family’s shop near the centre of Ettadhamen. He’d been on the streets with other young men over the weekend. “People are hungry. They want revenge against the state,” he says through an interpreter. “I won’t lie about it, they want another revolution.” His friend, Ahmed*, sitting in a plastic chair nearby, adds: “The police don’t dare to come here. Even the Tunisian media doesn’t come here. No one listens to what we have to say.”
Before the coronavirus lockdown, Ahmed travelled the country buying fruit and vegetables to sell on to traders in Tunis. “Everyone I spoke to was angry,” he says, recalling the conversations he’d had in several towns and villages. “It’s all age groups. Even children aged 10 are angry. Thank God we have houses and food to eat. I see families of up to 10 members who can’t afford that. They don’t even have 200 millimes, (about 5p) for a baguette.” Yassine tells the story of a popcorn seller in Ettadhamen, a common sight in Tunisia, who was stopped by the police for not wearing a mask. “They fined him 60TD [Tunisian dinars, about £16]. He asked them why he would be selling popcorn if he had 60TD,” Yassine says between customers. “He said he knew the price of a mask and, if he had it, he would spend it on his children.” Others are less approving of the unrest. Salah, 40, complains of being tired. He has been up all night, protecting his white goods stall from potential looters. He points to the post office and the opticians further down the road, both of which he says were looted. “They weren’t protesting, they were stealing,” he says. “If you want to protest, do so during the day, not during the night.”
Unemployment, especially among the young, has long been a driver of social unrest in Tunisia. For years, unemployment has stood at about 15%. However, among 15- to 24-year-olds the figure rises to 36%, with many remaining out of work for significant periods. The pandemic has made things worse. The country is reeling from the loss of its vital tourism sector, including the vast network of ancillary industries that provide produce and services to tourist resorts, and prospects are grim.
The situation has led many to migrate. In 2020, Italian authorities reported 12,883 irregular arrivals from Tunisia. The previous year the number was 2,654. In Ettadhamen, a passing young man gives his name as Hassan. He grins, barely able to disguise the pride he feels over his part in the protests. A light rain catches on the acrylic fur of his hoodie. He says the reasons for the protests are government neglect, poverty and the viciousness of the police. A passerby waits for a break in the conversation before asking for 500 millimes (13p). “There you go,” Hassan says. “Write about that. That’s life here.” * Names have been changed"
2021-01-20T06:00:13Z,global-development,Global development,Food to go? Covid threatens Hyderabad's famous street food carts,"On a normal working day, Venkateshwara Rao would be ready by 4pm, stationed on the pavement waiting for office workers to emerge and order their favourite varieties of idli and dosa from his bandi, a food cart grandly named Kavyajyotika Tiffin Centre. “When the lockdown was lifted, but with many restrictions still in place, the inflow of customers plummeted. However, the last few weeks have been good with a handful of workers back in offices and people lining up for takeaways at my bandi,” says Rao. Carts such as Rao’s, called bandi in the local Telugu language, have long doled out affordable breakfasts and late-night dinners to thousands of IT professionals, students, and workers in the 450-year-old city of Hyderabad, India’s emerging IT hub. Here, just a month before the pandemic hit, Amazon opened its largest campus outside the US. Microsoft and Google are already in the city, bringing in people from different regions of India.
These workers rely on the bandis, close to 100,000 mobile food-carts and stalls dotting the alleys and pavements near the residential and commercial complexes, for their daily food and drinks. The bandis serve as hang-out spots during office breaks, where workers can catch up over their food or cup of tea. Before Covid, bandis provided a livelihood to almost 12% of the city’s population and contributed to Hyderabad being designated a Unesco Creative City of Gastronomy in 2019. According to an ILO report (2018), the informal sector accounts for 88.2% of India’s labour market. In urban areas, these informal workers are usually as street vendors, home workers, domestic staff and waste pickers; with street vendors making up 14% of the sector. Running a business from the pavement brings its own share of uncertainties, and the pandemic is proving to be the biggest of them all. Until new laws were introduced in 2014, “there was no scope for protecting the livelihood rights and social security of urban street vendors”, says Arbind Singh, national coordinator of the National Association of Street Vendors in India, an advocacy organisation working with more than a million sellers. The pandemic restrictions have hit the bandi traders hard, with many shutting up shop and migrating back to their villages. “Our family managed to sail through the lockdown with the meagre savings we had. Many of the other vendors aren’t so fortunate,” says Rao. The Indian government launched a micro-credit scheme in June 2020, to provide affordable loans to street vendors. While the scheme has had a positive response, Rao hasn’t opted for it as he is confident of recouping his lockdown losses in the coming months.
More than 3 million street vendors have applied, over 50,000 of them from Hyderabad alone. “One of the major benefits of this scheme is that it’s speeding up the streamlining process of identifying and legitimising genuine street vendors who possess no valid identity cards until now,” says Singh. However, with many people apprehensive about eating out and employees working from home, Hyderabad’s bandis face an uncertain future. “It’s better to have fewer customers and earn a little, than keep the bandi shut and see our savings dwindle,” says Rao, as he goes to prepare an order for a consultant working from home. He can only hope the customers will come back, and soon.

2021-01-19T17:37:19Z,global-development,Global development,Landmark hearing to examine handling of  domestic abuse cases by courts,"A landmark hearing in the court of appeal is under way to examine how cases of domestic abuse are handled by judges in the family courts in England and Wales. It concerns four conjoined appeals which feature allegations including marital or partner rape and coercive control, which emerged during private proceedings to address disputes centred on access to children. The appeals have been brought by mothers who have made serious claims against the fathers of their children, and challenge the decisions made by circuit judges at the family courts during the last 18 months. Two of the cases relate to decisions by Judge Robin Tolson, who was criticised last year by a more senior judge based in the Family Division of the high court over his handling of rape allegations. Ms Justice Russell upheld a woman’s appeal after she complained Tolson had deduced she could not have been raped because she took “no physical steps” to stop her assailant. Barrister Christopher Hames QC, representing one of the four women, says his client is challenging Tolson’s decision to make “absolutely no findings” in respect of her “myriad of allegations”, including complaints of non-consensual sex, coercive control and that her partner “slapped her hard” when she was heavily pregnant. The court of appeal heard how the mother had had an on-off relationship with her ex-partner, who had wrongfully retained their child at his home overseas after the mother had left them there for a visit. Hames said Judge Tolson ignored an important admission by the father that on a few occasions he used physical violence. He told the court of appeal on Tuesday that Tolson had found the father’s account to be consistent, despite police evidence to the contrary. Hames asserted that Tolson’s reference to the mother’s mental health issues as her “demons” flavoured his entire approach to her and her evidence. He said: “It was clear the judge was not keeping an open mind about the allegations the mother made. He didn’t analyse the evidence appropriately at all. He failed to take a holistic evaluation of all the evidence before him.” Hames said Tolson had wrongfully placed emphasis on the fact the alleged non-consensual sex preceded “many other occasions of consensual sex” and the decision by the mother to leave the child abroad with the father. “It should not be taken that just because a woman has consented to sex in the past that she should be taken as consenting every time … I would have hoped that this is an assumption long assigned to the judicial dustbin.” The appeal raised issues of how claims of coercive and controlling behaviour are handled in the family courts.
“In this appeal, as in other cases, the real question is not limited to what happened, but whether those events were abuse themselves and/or whether there is sufficient evidence of patterns of behaviour which is demonstrative of an abusive relationship,” Hames told appeal judges Sir Andrew McFarlane, Lady King and Lord Holroyde in a written case outline. Hames said Tolson had commented that incidents of note were “insignificant in themselves” and ignored that victims of abuse do not always recognise themselves as victims and as a result may not report abuse to the authorities. On behalf of the respondent, barrister Janet Bazley QC highlighted “extravagant claims” made by the mother including that the father had a personality disorder and that one of his older children was a risk to their child. Bazley said Tolson had concluded it was impossible to reconcile sending a very young child to live with their father for an extended period with her claims and concerns about the father’s ability to provide adequate care. The court also heard that the mother had told psychiatrists the father was a “good man and not abusive”. Barrister Amanda Weston QC, who is representing a second woman challenging a ruling by Tolson, said he had been wrong to find her client’s allegation of rape “deeply unconvincing” because she had had consensual intercourse with the father on other occasions. “The judge failed to consider the rape allegations in the context of a pattern of coercive control,” she said in a written outline of the case. “The judge was wrong to find the mother’s case ‘weakened’ because she did not conform to his stereotype of the ideal victim, as she delayed in reporting the allegations.” Charlotte Proudman, one of the mother’s lawyers, told the Guardian: “These appeals show the need to update how family courts approach cases involving rape, domestic abuse and coercive control. All too often we see outdated attitudes towards wider domestic abuse, which could leave parents and children at risk of harm. “It’s been two decades since the family courts have looked at these issues and these landmark appeals couldn’t be more timely.” A report by the Ministry of Justice published last year warned that “rape myths” can be applied in the family jurisdiction to undermine a woman’s credibility. Two further women have challenged rulings by other judges – Judge Jane Evans-Gordon and Judge Richard Scarratt. No findings of abuse had been made against any of the men involved and each of them opposes the appeals. It is anticipated appeal judges will not only decide whether or not to uphold or reject the appeals – but may also issue new guidance to family court judges based on the findings. The hearing continues. • This article was amended on 21 January 2021. The headline of an earlier version referred to “UK courts”, but the hearing relates to family courts in England and Wales.

2021-01-19T09:13:31Z,global-development,Global development,EU border force head faces calls to quit over allegations he 'misled' MEPs,"The head of the EU’s border force is under growing pressure to stand down after being accused by the European commission of acting unlawfully and giving misleading evidence to MEPs. The allegations against Fabrice Leggeri, the executive director of Frontex, relate to the agency’s failure to recruit any of the 40 officers it is obliged to employ to protect the rights of people crossing into Europe. The former French civil servant is accused of presenting his explanation for the lack of recruitment of “fundamental rights officers” in a “misleading manner” when giving evidence to the European parliament last month, according to a letter from the commission’s director-general for migration and home affairs, Monique Pariat. In her letter to Leggeri dated 18 December, Pariat further claimed that the head of the border agency had acted “unlawfully” in 2019 by publishing two vacancy notices for positions in Frontex without the approval of its management board. The development will pile pressure on Leggeri, whose agency is already under investigation by the EU’s anti-fraud watchdog, Olaf, over a range of claims including allegations that its guards had been involved in forcing refugees and migrants out of EU waters at a Greek-Turkish maritime border. The most incendiary claims about the involvement of Frontex border guards in “pushbacks” – denied by the agency – are also the subject of an internal investigation. A first draft of an internal report on the issue is due to be presented to the management board on Wednesday. Frontex has previously stated it is fully cooperating with Olaf and its investigations “do not necessarily imply any malpractice”.
Asked whether Leggeri should consider his position, the EU’s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, told the Guardian: “I have no comment on that. Now that we have processes going on and they have not been finalised and I think they should be finalised.” However, the former Swedish minister added that it was clear that “some of the things being said by the executive director in parliament [are] not true”. Johansson said she had been “very upset” by claims first made in October over Frontex’s alleged complicity in illegal and often dangerous pushbacks aimed at preventing asylum seekers crossing the Aegean Sea, adding that systems for reporting abuse needed to be in place. Evidence against Frontex includes testimonies and video footage showing one of the agency’s vessels manoeuvring dangerously near a crowded dinghy full of people and creating waves that drove them back. A joint investigation from Lighthouse Reports, Bellingcat, Der Spiegel, ARD and TV Asahi documented six instances where the agency was either directly involved in a pushback or in close proximity to one. In a statement in October, Frontex restated its commitment to preventing refoulement, or illegal pushbacks, of people seeking international protection. Johansson said: “The first time I’ve heard that, I called immediately the executive director. I was very upset and he has to clarify what’s actually going on. “I was not really satisfied with the explanation. So that’s why I called for an extraordinary meeting of the management board, and there have been several extraordinary meetings and also ordinary meetings of the management board, and they are taking their responsibility to find out what has been going on.
“But also what kind of proper routines that should be in place in Frontex. We know that by the regulation they should have 40 fundamental rights monitors in place by 5 December – they have none. So this is also part of things that need to be clarified and need to be set up in a in a proper way,” she said. “It’s for me, 100%, clear that our own agency has to be fully complying to EU [law] and fundamental rights. “They also have to be able to prove that in an efficient way and to have proper routines for reporting in place to make sure that if officers on Frontex missions have seen or been aware of illegal things going on there have to be proper systems to report that.” Last year Frontex, which has a €5.6bn (£4.7bn) budget for the next seven years, was given a mandate to create a 10,000-strong armed force to be deployed at the EU’s external borders as a response to the migration crisis. In recent days, the agency unveiled a new uniform for its guards.
Frontex’s executive director has strongly rejected allegations about the agency’s operational conduct during repeated EU parliamentary scrutiny hearings. Leggeri has blamed delays in establishing a robust internal monitoring mechanism, including the recruitment of 40 rights experts, on ineffective bureaucracy from within the commission itself. In Pariat’s letter, which has been shared with the parliament’s committee on civil liberties, justice and home affairs, she said there had been sufficient time and resources available to Leggeri to fulfil his obligations. “The commission has consistently and swiftly provided all necessary guidance in order to allow the agency to reach that objective,” she wrote. Sophie in’t Veld, an MEP from the liberal Renew Europe group, said there were clear flaws in the agency’s structure. “The system is a mess, you can’t handle a body like this when you have 10,000 armed people at your disposal,” she said. Veld told the Guardian that “answers are expected” and if they are not provided then, “inevitably, the discussion will have to be about the director’s position itself”. A Frontex spokesperson said: “Unfortunately, some misunderstandings in such demanding times and online discussions are unavoidable. We regret any that might have occurred and look forward to continued collaboration to together keep our borders safe with the essential participation of the standing corps, fully respecting fundamental rights. “EU commission vice-president Margaritis Schinas and commissioner Ylva Johansson have expressed confidence in Mr Leggeri at many occasions in recent months. The Frontex Management Board, which represents the border authorities of member states, has not raised any objections to his leadership. Mr Leggeri has no plans to resign and remains determined to lead the agency is these challenging times.”"
2021-01-19T07:15:49Z,global-development,Global development,Landlocked Lesotho faces food crisis amid Covid border closures,"Almost a quarter of Lesotho’s population will require food aid between January and March as a result of Covid-19 restrictions, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has warned. More than 580,000 people out of a population of 2.2 million are estimated to be food insecure, despite predictions of normal to above average rains this year and the potential for above average cereal production. The FAO said Covid-19 had reduced household incomes, harming people’s ability to buy fertiliser or to hire workers, which was “likely to limit the potential increases in yields”. The situation in Lesotho has been exacerbated by extended lockdowns in neighbouring South Africa to curb the spread of the virus, which the agency said would prolong high levels of unemployment and loss of income.
The number of people requiring food assistance this year is about 35% higher than the number between October 2019 and March 2020, said the FAO. In 2019, the UN appealed for $34 million (£25 million) to provide food aid for half a million people until May last year, following poor rains over two consecutive seasons. It warned that thousands of people were close to famine. Lesotho imports the bulk of its goods and services from South Africa and has been feeling the effects of tougher lockdown restrictions imposed by President Cyril Ramaphosa earlier this month. South Africa has now surpassed 1.3 million cases of Covid-19 and has consistently recorded more than 10,000 new daily cases since 1 January. Ramaphosa has closed all land borders until 15 February and imposed restrictions on public gatherings. “The increase in the prevalence and severity of food insecurity has been predominantly driven by the effects of the lockdown measures to contain the Covid-19 pandemic,” said the FAO. “The restrictions on the movement of people and the closure of non-essential industries resulted in the loss of jobs and incomes, reducing people’s capacity to access adequate diets. The restrictions affected the workforce within the country, but also migrant workers in South Africa.”
The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (Fews Net) had also noted that below average incomes were being recorded in Lesotho due to Covid-19 restrictions and poor 2020 harvests, compounded by above-average staple food prices. In its December report, Fews Net said some areas of the country were at crisis hunger levels because of “low food access driven by depleted own-produced food stocks, below-average incomes, and slightly above average staple food prices”. It said: “Households are trying to mitigate existing food consumption gaps through market food purchases from earned income. Agricultural labour opportunities are seasonally increasing; however, wages are below average, and market food purchases are not expected to fully cover food consumption gaps.” According to Fews Net, an estimated 93,000 migrant workers returned home to Lesotho at the beginning of lockdowns in South Africa last March. This resulted in a significant reduction in remittances, an essential source of income for a large proportion of people in Lesotho. Although some people started returning to South Africa for work at the beginning of October, Fewsnet said labour migration was still below average as both countries’ economies had not yet recovered from the impact of Covid-19 lockdowns. The requirement to produce a negative Covid-19 test at the border is also a limitation."
2021-01-18T11:00:27Z,global-development,Global development,Dominican Republic activists fear total abortion ban banishes women to the dark ages,"As Argentina becomes the first major Latin American country to fully legalize abortion, activists in the Dominican Republic fear their own government is banishing its women to the dark ages by upholding a total ban first implemented in 1884. The Dominican Republic is one of four countries in Latin America – along with Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador – where abortion is illegal in all circumstances. Scores of Dominican women die each year from botched attempts to end unwanted pregnancies. Incomplete abortions and miscarriages are estimated to result in 8% of the country’s maternal deaths every year.
“The decision to legalize abortion in Argentina is a triumph for all women,” said Ysabel Paulino, a Dominican feminist and educator at the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo. “It is a fight we in the Dominican Republic have been waging – to defend the destiny of our bodies, what we do with our bodies and our right to life.” Despite the current ban, Dominican women go to extreme lengths to self-induce, often in secrecy and without clear medical guidance. These women risk up to two years in jail, while medical professionals face up to 20 years in prison and the loss of their license for aiding in a termination. In August, the president of the chamber of deputies, Alfredo Pacheco, created national uproar when he submitted a revised version of the country’s penal code which retained the abortion ban. Amid broad criticism, Pacheco soon after announced a new law permitting abortion in three cases: when a person’s life is in danger, when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, and when the fetus is incompatible with life. Feminist organizations condemned the ruling as insufficient, claiming the law would prove worthless against a penal code criminalizing abortion. It remains unclear when the new law will take effect. Meanwhile, the chamber of deputies is expected to pass the penal code sometime this year. It will then needs to be approved by the senate before President Luis Abinader will ultimately decide if it becomes law. Despite the ban, the Dominican health ministry already allows some exceptions under their supervision, according to Dr José De Lancer Despradel, the former general director of maternal, child and adolescent health. In 2012, he authorized the health ministry to make an exception in the high-profile case of Rosaura Almonte Hernández, or “Esperancita”, a 16-year-old leukemia patient, who doctors refused to treat with chemotherapy because she was nine weeks pregnant. De Lancer offered to move Rosaura from a private hospital to a public one to terminate her pregnancy, but the girl’s mother, Rosa Hernández, declined the offer, he said, because she didn’t want to transport her daughter. Rosaura later died after a miscarriage that sent her into cardiac arrest. Selene Soto, Hernández’s lawyer, said Hernández was not properly made aware of the options she had at the time. Furthermore, moving Rosaura would have been too costly for Hernández, she said, who was solely paying her daughter’s medical expenses. The story illustrates the many obstacles women face in a country where even the discussion of abortion is considered taboo and reproductive care is severely limited. When asked if the ministry continues to make exceptions, De Lancer said, “All of us who are doctors, gynecologists, and who work in the environment, we know that these things are done constantly. But they are handled with discretion,” he said. “They do not come to light because it is prohibited,” he said of the back channel procedures. “It is illegal.” Meanwhile, the death toll climbs. Damaris Mejía, a 31-year-old Dominican-Haitian woman, was 16 weeks pregnant when she started experiencing severe uterine pain in 2012. Doctors at a local hospital told her she had suffered a miscarriage and would need a curettage – a forbidden procedure that would clear her uterine lining of the fetus, but cautioned that they would be unlikely to find a doctor willing to terminate her pregnancy because of the ban. Doctors around the world perform curettages to treat uterine conditions, including abnormal bleeding and use them to detect cancer. The family drove from clinic to clinic, hospital to hospital, with no luck. Clandestine clinics exist throughout the country, but charge up to $500 – way beyond the reach of poor rural women in a country with a minimum wage of $250 a month. Researchers consider Dominican women of Haitian descent to be a group most vulnerable to the prohibition. Within days, Damaris’s pain was excruciating. At the final hospital the family visited, a doctor told her she should go home and rest. She died the following afternoon. An autopsy showed that her death had been caused by an infection from the dead foetus. Eight years later, the anguish of her death has not diminished for Damaris’s family, said her sister Juliana. “I don’t want to see any family live what we are living, what we have lived, what we have suffered,” she said."
2021-01-18T07:45:23Z,global-development,Global development,G4S migrant workers 'forced to pay millions' in illegal fees for jobs,"Migrant workers working for the British security company G4S in the United Arab Emirates have collectively been forced to pay millions of pounds in illegal fees to recruitment agents to secure their jobs, the Guardian can reveal. An investigation into G4S’s recruitment practices has found that workers from south Asia and east Africa have been made to pay up to £1,775 to recruitment agents working for the British company in order to get jobs as security guards for G4S in the UAE. Forcing workers to pay recruitment fees is a widespread practice, but one that is illegal in the UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The practice allows companies to pass on the costs of recruitment to workers from some of the poorest countries in the world, leaving many deep in debt and vulnerable to modern forms of slavery, such as debt bondage. Some south Asian countries allow agents to charge fees, but these are capped at a level far below the rate most G4S employees have paid. Human rights groups have told the Guardian that G4S should repay the recruitment fees to its workforce in the UAE and across the Gulf. In 2019, G4S employed about 9,000 workers in the UAE and 30,000 workers across the region. Experts estimate remediation payments to current workers alone would probably run into tens of millions of pounds. “Businesses must repay employees who have had to pay these illegal and exploitative costs in order to get their jobs. The costs of recruitment should be borne by the employer, not the worker,” said James Lynch, a director at FairSquare Projects, which advocates for migrant rights in the Gulf. The findings come as G4S shareholders are considering a £3.8bn takeover bid from the US security firm Allied Universal. The Guardian interviewed 28 workers from south Asia and east Africa working as G4S security guards and labourers in Dubai who had been employed by the company for between one and 12 years. Each said they had been forced to pay recruitment agents in their home countries. Security guards paid between the equivalent of between £485 and £1,775 to get their jobs. The average fee was £936. Many workers said they had sold family land or borrowed money at high interest rates to afford the fees, leaving them burdened with debt. The true costs of recruitment were significantly higher, as these figures may not include additional costs such as medical tests, or the interest paid on loans taken out to pay the recruitment fees. “If you don’t pay, they will remove your name from the list. They will deselect you,” said Dipendra, a security guard from Nepal, who paid 130,000 Nepali rupees (£808) nine years ago. “It was huge amount back then. It took two years to pay back.” G4S claims that since 2020, its migrant workers in the UAE no longer pay recruitment fees. “We have moved to an in-country, direct hiring model, which means that we rarely, if ever, use migrant worker recruitment agencies,” said G4S in a statement. Hiring workers “directly” often involves recruiting migrants who have made their own way to the UAE in the hope of finding a job, meaning they continue to bear the major costs, debts and risks of recruitment. Sarah, a security guard from Uganda, said that while looking for a job in Dubai she had to pay for accommodation, food, transport and two return flights. “I may have paid around 9,000 dirhams (£1,790) in total … At least I got a job. One is always better than zero,” she said. The Guardian has seen a 2008 internal G4S report into the recruitment of Nepali workers for jobs as security guards in conflict zones in Iraq and Afghanistan, which states that, “potential recruits pay a significant sum to their local recruitment sources to be considered for … overseas contracts”. In an interview with the Guardian in 2019, a G4S employee who oversaw the recruitment of guards in Nepal and India for conflict zones, said G4S did not charge any fees for recruitment but admitted that potential recruits might have to pay agents between £1,000 and £3,000. “Lots of bribes happen. You really need a job, you’ve been told by a third party that you will get selected and you don’t want to miss the job so you give money,” he said.
A prospective recruit hoping to get posted to Afghanistan said he was told by an agent who directed candidates to G4S: “If you don’t give money, you won’t go.” G4S plc is one of the world’s largest security companies, employing more than half a million people in around 85 countries. It is registered, and has its headquarters, in the UK. In its guidelines for fair recruitment, the UN’s International Labour Organization states: “No recruitment fees or related costs should be charged to, or otherwise borne by, workers or jobseekers.” Legal advice commissioned by the Good Law Project, a UK-based non-profit organisation, concluded that charging recruitment fees to migrant workers looking to secure jobs overseas was: “likely to be extortion by the recruitment companies which appear to be preying on the desperate”. Although fees were paid to recruitment agents and not G4S directly, workers in Dubai described the close links between the two. They all said G4S staff interviewed them in person, and once selected, the agent demanded a fee for their services and related costs, such as air tickets. Workers said that G4S was aware that they had to pay to be recruited but turned a blind eye to the practice. “I can say 100% that G4S knows the agency was charging us,” said Sunil, a security guard from Sri Lanka. “It’s easy for G4S to find out. They just have to ask. Did you pay? Everybody will say, ‘Yes, we paid’ … it’s not rocket science,” said Lokesh, a Nepali guard.
They said G4S exploited the fact that workers are desperate for a job and unaware that they should not pay, in countries where paying for recruitment is the norm. “We cannot refuse to pay when everyone else is paying,” said Arjun, another guard from Nepal. In November 2019, Norway’s Council on Ethics, which monitors investments for the Norwegian government pension fund, excluded G4S from its investments after the council advised that the firm’s recruitment practices contributed to “an unacceptable risk” that the company was contributing to “systematic human rights violations”. A G4S spokesperson said: “G4S is committed to the highest standards to ensure that migrant workers are treated with respect and dignity. We are working to raise global standards across the industry with all our partners.” G4S added that it had adopted an “employer pays” principle in the UAE and where it does use recruitment agents it selects them using a code of conduct, “which includes a strict requirement not to charge migrant workers any recruitment fees”."
2021-01-17T16:33:56Z,global-development,Global development,'We are worried': Indians hopeful but anxious as vaccination drive begins,"Emerging from Holy Family hospital in New Delhi, Ram Verma, a sanitation worker, breathed a deep sigh of relief. As one of the first in India to receive a coronavirus vaccine on Saturday – marking the start of the world’s largest vaccination programmes – he had been feeling a little jittery. “I must admit I was nervous,” said Verma, who had received his Covaxin jab in a centre set up in the hospital car park. “A lot of us were. I thought I might faint or have side-effects. After all, it is something totally new. But I’m fine. There is nothing to worry about.”
Anila Singh, a nurse at Ram Manohar Lohia hospital in the capital, said she had almost cried with relief, when she heard she was to be among the first to receive the vaccine. “I thought of all those I had seen dying, all the families who lost someone they loved and my own daily fear about catching the virus, it all surged back,” she said. “Finally we are going to turn the page.” Across India, 3,006 vaccination centres began the mammoth task of vaccinating 300 million people by August, with healthcare workers, police and army members given first priority. India ranks second in the world for Covid-19 cases, registering more than 10.5 million cases and more than 151,000 deaths. Two vaccines have been given emergency approval for India’s immunisation programme: the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, known in India as Covishield, and Covaxin, a domestic product developed by the Indian pharmaceutical company Bharat Biotech in conjunction with the Indian council of medical research, a government body. While it was a slow start on Saturday, pressure was on to pick up the pace. Within a week, Mumbai plans to vaccinate 50,000 people daily, while in Delhi the figure is even more ambitious. “Once we have 1,000 vaccination centres in the city, we will vaccinate 100,000 every day,” said Dr Suneela Garg, who heads Delhi’s vaccination taskforce. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, hailed the start of the vaccine programme as a moment of pride for India, proclaiming it “shows the world our capability”. Yet a shadow hung over proceedings, as doctors, health rights advocates and scientists have called into question the adequacy and safety of Covaxin and accused the government of side-stepping protocol to get it approved.
The vaccine has not completed phase 3 human trials and there is no conclusive final data on its efficacy, placing India among Russia and China, which have also decided to roll out a vaccine still in its trial phase. The government has said Covaxin is “100% safe” and on Saturday 5.5 million doses of it were dispatched out across the country, though they will be given in “trial mode”. On Saturday, the resident doctors’ association of Ram Manohar Lohia hospital wrote a letter to the hospital’s superintendent expressing concern about Covaxin and requested they be allowed to have Covishield instead. Dr Nirmalya Mohapatra, a senior resident doctor and vice-president of the association, said: “There is a lot of apprehension because we don’t have the same data for Covaxin. We are healthcare workers and we are worried that Covaxin might not protect us from another wave of infection because it is still in trials. So we are just requesting to be given a choice about which vaccine we are given.” Mohapatra said that without a choice being offered, it could lead to widespread refusal to take up the vaccine among doctors. On Saturday at Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, only 31 of the 100 healthcare workers registered to be given the vaccine turned up, partly due to a technical hitch but also attributed to concerns among staff that the hospital is only offering Covaxin. Bharat Biotech has also been accused of ethical violations for allegedly testing Covaxin on people in the slums of Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh, without them being aware it was a trial. Seven people have claimed they were told they were receiving a vaccine that would protect them from the virus, and were paid 750 rupees, with no awareness it was an untested vaccine or that they might have received a placebo.
In a letter to the government, multiple health rights organisations, including the All India Drug Action Network, the Forum for Medical Ethics Society and the People’s Health Movement India, demanded the Covaxin trial be halted in Bhopal. “The testimonies demonstrate inducement which represents a breach of the tenet of voluntary participation without inducement or coercion,” they said. “Many participants were misled to enrol in the trial, their vulnerabilities preyed upon.” Bharat Biotech denied any ethical violations and said the trial fully complied with “good clinical practice guidelines and all regulatory provisions that apply to the conduct of clinical trials in India”. The questions over Covaxin have also not helped in the government’s desperate attempts to counter misinformation and fake rumours about the vaccines that have been circulating on WhatsApp and fuelling hesitancy. On Wednesday, the Delhi chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, had appealed to people to stay alert against vaccine misinformation. At the Spinal Injuries Centre in New Delhi, Dr Kali Datta Das, a surgeon, said some fake rumours on WhatsApp about the vaccine had caused a last-minute ripple of anxiety on Saturday. However, he remained upbeat. “We vaccinated 100 staff today and it was a very positive mood because people felt that there is finally a solution in sight to Covid-19,” Das said."
2021-01-17T16:27:23Z,global-development,Global development,Bobi Wine's party to challenge Museveni’s Ugandan election victory,"The party of the Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine says it is preparing to challenge President Yoweri Museveni’s election victory as it condemned what it called the house arrest of Wine and his wife. Amid growing international concern about the conduct of the election, Wine said in an interview from his house, where he is surrounded by army and police, that he was “worried about my life and the life of my wife”. Announcing the planned challenge to the results, Mathias Mpuuga, of Wine’s National Unity Platform, told a news conference: “We have evidence of ballot stuffing and other forms of election malpractice and after putting it together we are going to take all measures that the law permits to challenge this fraud.” The continued confinement of Wine came as clashes between security forces and opposition protesters led to at least two deaths. Museveni, 76, who has ruled Uganda without pause since seizing control in 1986, when he helped to end years of tyranny under Idi Amin and Milton Obote, claimed a sixth five-year term, extending his rule to four decades, according to official results.
In a generational clash watched across the African continent with a booming young population and a host of ageing leaders, the 38-year-old Wine, a singer turned lawmaker, posed arguably the greatest challenge yet to Museveni. The clashes with police following the announcement of Museveni’s victory took place in a number of locations, including in Gomba, where Wine lives, and neighbouring Sembabule. They were quickly dispersed. Wine, who dismissed Museveni’s victory as “cooked-up, fraudulent results,” remained under military house arrest on Sunday as his supporters called for his release. Uganda’s electoral commission said that Museveni received 58% of the vote to Wine’s 34%, with a voter turnout of 52%. The United States and Britain issued statements on Saturday calling for investigations into fraud reports and other concerns over the election as the top US diplomat in African raised questions over the integrity of the election. “Uganda’s electoral process has been fundamentally flawed,” Tibor Nagy, tweeted, warning that “the US response hinges on what the Ugandan government does now”. Museveni dismissed the claims of vote-rigging. “I think this may turn out to be the most cheating-free election since 1962 [when Uganda won independence from Britain],” said Museveni in a national address on Saturday. Wine tweeted on Sunday that military units are not allowing him and his wife, Barbie, from leaving their house, not even to harvest food from their garden. “It’s now four days since the military surrounded our home and placed my wife and I under house arrest,” said Wine’s tweet. “We have run out of food supplies and when my wife tried to pick food from the garden yesterday, she was blocked and assaulted by the soldiers staged in our compound.”
“We ask Ugandans to reject this fraud,” the opposition National Unity Platform said in a statement on Sunday. “A revolution of this nature cannot be stopped by a fraudulent election.” The party said the prominent MP Francis Zaake, who had been arrested during an attempted visit to Wine’s house on Friday, had been admitted to hospital “badly beaten and brutalised” by security forces. Ugandan officials have said the soldiers and police were there for Wine’s own security. The opposition party said that its “quest for a free Uganda is on despite the current attack on free speech and association,” referring to the days-long shutdown of the internet by the government. The party urged its followers to use every “constitutionally available avenue” to pursue political change. “As we speak now, our president [Wine] is under illegal detention at his home,” Mpuuga told reporters at the headquarters of Wine’s party in Kampala. “Perhaps his crime was to defeat Mr Museveni on the day he has selected as his crowning,” he said. “[Wine] is not allowed to leave or receive visitors at his home.” Wine’s party alleged that soldiers had actually broken into his compound. “We are concerned about the state in which he is,” a party spokesman, Joel Ssenyonyi, said of Wine. “Is his house now a barracks?” Although Museveni stays in power, at least nine of his cabinet ministers, including the vice-president, were defeated in the parliamentary elections, many losing to candidates from Wine’s party. Wine had strong support in Uganda’s cities, where frustration with unemployment and corruption is high. The electoral commission deflected questions about how countrywide voting results were transmitted during the nationwide internet blackout by saying “we designed our own system”. “We did not receive any orders from above during this election,” the commission chair, Simon Byabakama, told reporters, adding his team was “neither intimidated nor threatened.” Tracking the vote was further complicated by the arrests of independent monitors and the denial of accreditation to most members of the US observer mission, leading the US to cancel its monitoring of the vote."
2021-01-16T08:00:26Z,global-development,Global development,"Give families cash to feed their children, there's overwhelming evidence it works | Arthur Potts Dawson","Dignity is not a word that you would normally associate with your weekly supermarket shop, or with planning how you might be going to feed your children each night. But right now, when families are under intense pressure to find enough money to keep food on the table and ensure their children have access to a healthy and nutritious diet, dignity is something we should all be demanding for those who depend on others for the means to feed their loved ones. If you have seen any of the images circulating on social media over the past few days showing the contents of meal packages provided to children whose parents are unable to feed them, you cannot but have been struck by the lack of dignity involved in receiving this support.
The sad array of vegetables and processed food being delivered in limited rations to families living on the breadline are an affront to every charitable instinct we hold dearly with regard to helping those who need a hand. I have seen what a lack of food and nutrition can do in some of the poorest countries of the world and I have also witnessed the impact of programmes that provide cash or vouchers to support communities of hungry families in a dignified and empowering fashion. The UN World Food Programme provides school meals for around 17 million children a year. It recognises the importance of effective food systems, and is launching a School Health Research Consortium at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to help the UK learn more from international experience and vice versa. What is so striking now is that the British government has been a global leader in driving change within the international aid sector to deliver food to hungry children and families in a more efficient and dignified way. As an advocate for more cash payments to hungry families in developing countries, the UK has revolutionised the delivery of food assistance, empowering those who need to provide for their families, supporting local economies and streamlining the aid delivery system to make it more efficient and cost effective. The World Food Programme (WFP) is just one example of an agency that has moved from delivering almost zero food assistance in cash in the early 2000s to a point where close to 40% of its aid is distributed as cash or vouchers. That’s close to £1.5bn for families to buy their own food, and it’s is being spent in more than 60 countries.
What has this to do with a poor family living under coronavirus lockdown in Bradford? In my mind, quite a lot: if the government understands the value of empowering and giving self-respect to hungry families in Malawi, why is it missing that point in Britain? Instead of paying companies to provide substandard food for children locked out of school, why can’t we give families the cash or the vouchers to make their own decisions about what to buy and how to stretch their budgets? We know doing so works, is more efficient, and gives those families dignity, rather than stripping them of it.
Sceptics might say that families cannot be trusted to spend money on food, that it might be wasted on alcohol or cigarettes. But from what I have seen in developing countries, the evidence is that families are responsible and make the right choices for their children. No mother wants to see her child go hungry. The WFP has found that cash or voucher payments only fail to make an important contribution when a country is at war, markets have collapsed and access to food is limited – even for those with money. Much as we are suffering from the impact of the pandemic and the latest lockdown, shops remain open here and the one big impediment to accessing fresh, nutritious food is a lack of money. It could not be more simple: increased cash payments will empower families struggling to feed their children, and restore their dignity, something that everyone deserves.

2021-01-15T09:30:23Z,global-development,Global development,Black women in the UK four times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth,"Black women are still four times more likely than white women to die in pregnancy or childbirth in the UK, and women from Asian ethnic backgrounds face twice the risk, according to a new report. The data shows a slight narrowing of the divide – last year’s report found black women were five times more likely to die – but experts say that is statistically insignificant and not a sign of progress. The lead author of the MBRRACE-UK report, Prof Marian Knight, said: “The drop to a fourfold difference should not be a reason to lessen our efforts at a time when addressing these inequalities among pregnant women and new mothers should be a priority. “The rate of deaths among white women has gone up by a tiny amount and the rate of black women has come down a little but neither of these are statistically significant changes because the overall rates are low.” Prof Maggie Rae, president of the Faculty of Public Health, said: “This year’s coronavirus pandemic has brought this disparity even more starkly to the fore, and we must not lose sight of the actions that are required to address systemic biases that impact on the care we provide for ethnic minority women.” The latest figures on maternal deaths and morbidity cover the period between 2016 and 2018, showing 217 women died during or up to six weeks after pregnancy out of 2,235,159 women giving birth in the UK. A further 349 women died up to a year after pregnancy. “Maternal mortality is uncommon so while there is an unacceptable racial disparity, even for black women the rate is low,” said Knight. “But what is significant is the statistics are likely to be a marker of similar disparities in severe pregnancy complications and what we call ‘near misses’. “What needs to happen now is more comprehensive research looking at maternal morbidity. Only then can we start to monitor the variations in outcome between different groups living in different areas of the UK.”
A report published in December by the joint committee on human rights highlighted the lack of an NHS target to end the disparity and urged the government to introduce one. Tinuke Awe, co-founder of campaign group Fivexmore, supports such a target. She said: “Urgent research is required to understand those statistics but also what is going on behind the data. “We know from hearing black women’s stories that for every person who unfortunately dies there is a whole group of women behind them who are suffering from poorer outcomes. Yet currently those near misses aren’t recorded anywhere.” Almost all of those who died during or after pregnancy had multiple issues such as mental or physical health problems, were victims of domestic abuse, or were living in a deprived area. More than half of those who died were overweight or obese. Cardiac disease represents the largest single cause of indirect maternal deaths. Also highlighted in the report was a twofold increase in the number of maternal deaths linked to epilepsy. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (Sudep) is uncommon but it occurred almost twice as often among women pregnant during 2016-2018 than in the previous three years. Knight said changes from 2018 onwards to the types of medication prescribed to manage a pregnant women’s epilepsy may account for the rise. Importantly, the report highlighted that preventive action is not just vital within maternity services. Public health actions are equally important. Women living in the most deprived areas were three times more likely to die than those in more affluent areas. Social services were also involved in the lives of 20% of the women who died compared with 12% in 2012–2014, suggesting greater coordination is needed between social services and maternity care. Kirsty Kitchen, head of policy at Birth Companions, said: “While the number of deaths remains low, inequalities are widening. These figures relate to a period pre-Covid-19 and we know those inequalities will become even more profound as women’s lives continue to be adversely impacted by the pandemic.” Interventions to address poverty, bad housing, domestic abuse and racism were vital, she said. “While the ethnic disparities are shocking and stark we should be equally shocked by the disparities that are widening along the lines of deprivation and disadvantage.” The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said it would continue working to address inequality through the Race Equality Taskforce. Its president, Dr Edward Morris, also urged the government to commit to a target of a 50% reduction in maternal mortality for black, Asian and minority ethnic women over the next five years."
2021-01-15T08:00:32Z,global-development,Global development,Pope’s adviser says Covid has highlighted ‘existential’ climate risk,"The pope’s newly appointed scientific adviser said the coronavirus pandemic has forced world leaders to face up to the “existential risk” of the climate crisis. Prof Ottmar Edenhofer said rich countries now had a moral duty to compensate poor countries already suffering the impacts. Edenhofer, director of the climate research institute MCC in Berlin and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, was appointed to provide scientific advice to the Vatican agency focusing on justice for refugees, the poor and the stateless. His appointment follows Pope Francis’s 2019 declaration of a climate emergency in which he said failing to act would be a “brutal act of injustice” towards the poor and future generations. Edenhofer told the Guardian he hoped his input would help drive action by governments.
“Weather extremes triggered by the destabilisation of our climate are already driving migration movements worldwide,” he said. “Droughts can cause simmering conflicts to flare up violently, and crop failures can drive up food prices. Unfortunately, if the planet continues to warm, migration and conflicts are likely to increase further. “The climate issue is fundamentally also a justice issue. It is therefore both a great honour and responsibility to provide scientific advice to the Holy See on these important issues.” Asked how climate deniers such as Donald Trump and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro could be persuaded to change, Edenhofer said: “I think it’s impossible to convince Donald Trump. But other leaders like Joe Biden, and also in China leaders are convinced. China is fully aware it will suffer from the impacts of climate change on water supply, which will cause huge problems.
“Protecting citizens is one of the main works of governments and governments cannot ignore existential risks. Because of Covid, international leaders are more aware of ‘fat tail’ risks, those of low probability but with the potential for huge damage. And in poor countries, the impact of climate change is not about a possibility in the future but is being felt today.” Edenhofer said the pope’s stark message on the crisis was important not only for Roman Catholics, but for evangelical Christians. “We cannot underestimate the pope is basically speaking for 1.3 billion people. I would even argue the message the pope sends to the world is also important for evangelical Christians, who have a huge problem so far in recognising climate change as an important issue. Because most of them see this as a kind of western European leftwing agenda. The pope makes very clear this is something which is not a partisan issue but it is something which is important for the whole world. “I’m very happy that the pope and the Catholic church as a global player have taken on responsibility to care about this issue. The Catholic church represents a socially conservative people and it is important the church can speak to these people.” The economist, who served as co-chair on the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group on mitigation from 2008 to 2015, has also worked with Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, the man behind the radical call to action on climate change.
His role, he said, was to update the Vatican on the scientific impacts of such changes on human development. “Justice and peace for migration was always an issue of the Catholic church. But now, the care of the global commons, including biodiversity laws, climate change, land degradation, they are an integral part of human development and I see this as a very, very important step.” Among the topics for papal discussion, he said, will be climate refugees and compensation for poorer countries from richer countries more responsible for toxic emissions. “They [richer countries] have a moral obligation to reduce emissions and achieve carbon neutralisation and at the same time, they have to compensate people in the developing countries for climate damages. There’s no doubt about this.” The Vatican, which Edenhofer said was responsible for persuading Poland to sign up to the Paris climate agreement, is expected to play an important role at the climate summit in Glasgow later this year."
2021-01-15T07:15:30Z,global-development,Global development,'Preserve my son’s name’: families of Tunisia’s Arab spring martyrs fight on,"Moslem Kasdallah rests on his crutches, the stump of his amputated leg on display. His voice hoarse, he yells the demands that, after years of delay, have brought him and the other wounded and bereaved of the Tunisian revolution to the steps of the government building they have been occupying since December. Some are on hunger strike, others have sewn their lips shut. Kasdallah carries a bottle of fuel and a lighter, ready to self-immolate. Yesterday marked 10 years since Tunisia’s autocrat Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and his family fled the country for Saudi Arabia, drawing to a close the month of unrest that began with the death of Mohamed Bouazizi, a street vendor who set himself on fire. Compared with the carnage that would follow in Syria and across much of the Arab world, Tunisians escaped relatively lightly. However, recognition for those killed and wounded during the volatile days and weeks between 2010 and 2011 remains disputed. After 10 years of pressure, the government has promised a provisional list, with final publication promised at some point before 20 March, to allow for appeals from those omitted. It’s a proposal rejected by the wounded and the families of the deceased, who insist publication should have coincided with the revolution’s official anniversary.
“They shot six of us and wounded 13,” Kasdallah tells an interpreter, describing how police fired into the crowd in the coastal city of Monastir without warning. “I was with my father and my brother. The police wanted to kill us,” he says. “I was shot twice. At first I didn’t realise I’d been shot. It was only with the second shot that I realised what had happened.” Recognising the dead and wounded of the revolution and including them in the official gazette is not a new idea. It was first suggested in 2011. Last October the Commission of Martyrs and the Wounded of the Revolution published an initial list of 129 dead and 634 wounded, but it carried no legal significance. Only with inclusion in the gazette does their involvement become legal fact. In Tunis, the wounded and the families of the dead feel pushed almost to breaking point. Their initial protest in Kasbah Square, at the heart of government, was violently broken up by police in mid-December. Protesters moved to occupy the offices of Abderrazak Kilani, president of the General Authority of Resistance Fighters and Martyrs and Wounded of the Revolution and of Terrorist Attacks, whom many hold responsible for the delay. Some are convinced that other forces have been at play. “The government is afraid of the public response to the list,” Lamia Farhani, a lawyer and president of the Association of Families of Martyrs and Wounded of the Revolution (Awfia), says. Some would be angered by omission, says Farhani, whose brother, Anis, was shot by the police on 13 January 2011. The security services have proved less than cooperative, with the ministry of the interior dragging its feet in sharing records, while the country’s powerful police unions lobbied for the inclusion of their own members.
There was little appetite among the demonstrators in Tunis for sharing space with those who had shot and tortured them 10 years ago. Like many relatives of those killed, Farhani and her family know the name of the officer who pulled the trigger. Many officers involved are still serving. Some have been promoted. Those who have been jailed have frequently seen their sentences quietly reduced after conviction. “There is also resistance from the state and those who were active within the old regime who are keen to keep events blurry,” Farhani says. “The list will make things official.” It will preserve their names in Tunisia’s collective memory, she says. “It will be clear.” The list’s final publication, whenever that may be, will mark a notable victory for most families, a further step in a battle towards justice. For some it is already too late. Slightly distant from the rest of the crowd in central Tunis, a quiet group of women sit holding pictures of sons killed during the events of 2010 and 2011. Among them is Om Saed Gharbi, 67, from Ariana, near Tunis. She has cancer and her husband died some time ago. She describes how her son Majdi died. He had been passing a protest on his way home from visiting neighbours following a tragedy of their own. Just as he reached his family house, he was seized by the police and shot. She has no doubts over her reasons for demanding the list be published. “In every country in the world the names of the martyrs are recognised. I want the same in Tunisia. I want history books to record my son’s name and for future generations to know it.”"
2021-01-15T03:00:25Z,global-development,Global development,"New year, new outbreak: China rushes to vaccinate 50 million as holiday looms","At a Shenzhen hospital, 21-year-old airport worker Wang Shuyue lines up to receive her second shot. “I feel it’s safe because so many people around the country have taken the vaccine so there shouldn’t be any major problems,” she tells the Guardian. “I think it should be effective otherwise there wouldn’t be so many people taking it.” Wang is one of 50 million people that China aims to vaccinate against Covid-19 in just a matter of weeks in one of the most ambitious vaccination drives on earth. Battling its worst outbreak in 10 months, the nation is pushing ahead with its aim to vaccinate about 3.5% of the population before the start of the lunar new year holiday on 11 February, when hundreds of millions of people crisscross the country to visit family and celebrate. China has committed to using its own vaccines to inoculate its people, and to share them with the rest of the world, particularly developing nations. The drive seeks to bolster - or repair - China’s reputation on the global stage after accusations of cover-up and early missteps in supplying protective equipment. There are logistical advantages to China’s offerings, but with major transparency concerns around late stage clinical data and some contradictory reports, health experts have urged caution. First announced in December, the vaccination drive involves more than 25,300 sites across a reported 75 cities and rural villages, delivering vaccines in two doses about 21 days apart, free. Local Chinese media reports suggest clinics have received either the emergency-approved Sinovac vaccine (for key workers) or the conditionally approved Sinopharm vaccine (for the wider population). The reported scope and speed of the program has outpaced others, including the US’s Operation Warp Speed and the rollout in Britain.
According to one clinic the Guardian visited, a record of the vaccination will be integrated with local health code apps, and allow recipients to bypass quarantine when travelling between cities and regions. The rollout began with 18- to 59-year-olds in key worker groups under emergency approvals, and then pivoted to vulnerable people before widening to all people over 60. Authorities aim to have all first doses administered by the end of this week, and second doses before the beginning of festivities. A health commission official, Wang Bin, said on Wednesday 10m doses had been administered so far, including about 1.6 million people under an emergency regime before full approvals were issued. Health experts told state media last week the current rate was likely to reach just 20 million people by deadline, but producers are speeding up production. The push comes as China reports consecutive days of more than 100 new cases, the highest daily totals since March. Most cases were reported among the rural population of Hebei, the province surrounding Beijing. On Thursday, it was reported that the first person had died from Covid in China in eight months. Three cities near Beijing are locked down. Logistical advantages – and setbacks Calvin Ho, an associate professor of law at Hong Kong university focusing on bioethics, said the 3.5% drive wasn’t expected to produce herd immunity – health authorities have said their eventual aim is for about 60-70% vaccination coverage – but it will give some protection as people gather for the new year. There were logistical advantages to China’s rollout compared with those of other nations, said Ho. The locally made vaccines don’t require freezing, making transportation and storage far simpler than the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines being used in countries such as the US and UK. China also has the ability to scale up production at a moment’s notice. The vaccine drive began well before the current Hebei outbreak. Some experts have questioned the need to rush vaccinations, given major concerns over transparency and the vaccine’s efficacy. The main two Chinese vaccines were produced using a historically successful and less risky method of using an inactive virus to trigger an immune response, but the producers and authorities have been accused of lacking transparency, releasing no phase 3 trial data from the international clinical trials. On Tuesday, Brazilian researchers revealed the Sinovac vaccine was far less effective than previously stated. The 50.38% overall efficacy pushes the vaccine just over the 50% World Health Organisation benchmark for approval, but falls below the 78% announced last week and well below the efficacy rates of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. The findings are likely to raise concerns in the 10 or so countries who have already ordered or received hundreds of millions of doses. Associate professor James Trauer, the head of epidemiological modelling at Monash University’s school of public health, said in countries like China which have had a relatively small epidemic (since Wuhan’s was contained), achieving herd immunity through vaccination was “critical”. However, those situational factors also meant it wasn’t urgent. “When you’re having a big vaccination program rollout there is a concern from a safety perspective that there could be reactions that are being missed. And it’s going to be really hard to judge from an efficacy perspective, because there’s so little coronavirus transmitting in China at present,” said Trauer. “They do have the opportunity to look for high quality data [first], and they’ve elected not to do that. It is a bit concerning.” HKU’s Ho said the risk of the early rollout appeared low. “Given that we don’t quite know for sure what the actual epidemiological situation is in China … it makes sense to have the precautionary measures in place if the means allow,” he said. On Tuesday, about a dozen people queued for a vaccine check-in at the Shenzhen Bao’an traditional Chinese medicine hospital group office, one of five official vaccination locations in the south China megacity. Ms Sun, who teaches Chinese to foreigners, is among those authorities hope to have vaccinated before the lunar new year holiday. She said she was a little concerned about safety when she had the first shot but hadn’t had any adverse reaction, so was now back for the second. “I decided to take the vaccine myself, it’s entirely free,” she said. In line with Sun, a man who declined to give his name said he travelled frequently within China for work, and so was taking it as a preventative measure. “I would encourage people who travel a lot, regardless of within or outside the country, to take the vaccine. But if you’re someone who sits in the office everyday then you can decide if it’s necessary.”"
2021-01-14T20:39:12Z,global-development,Global development,"Argentina legalizing abortion will spur reform in Latin America, minister says","Argentina’s historic decision to legalize abortion will help spur reform across Latin America, the country’s gender minister has told the Guardian, as a new law allowing the practice goes into effect. The bill passed by congress on 30 December made Argentina the first major Latin American country to legalize abortion. It will be signed into law on Thursday evening by the president, Alberto Fernández, marking a turning point for a region where the Catholic church has been a major cultural and political influence for centuries. “We know there will be a lot of resistance in the rest of Latin America, especially from the Catholic church and other churches,” said the gender minister, Elizabeth Gómez Alcorta, in a Zoom interview. “The regional conquest will take some time, but I have been getting calls from officials in Mexico, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Peru. Progressive governments are returning to power in some countries, I am very confident there will be a change.” Gómez Alcorta wore a green wristband in reference to the green scarf adopted as a symbol of Argentina’s women’s movement. “The legalization of abortion in Argentina will have an effect across the whole region,” Gómez Alcorta said. “We will paint Latin America green”. Elective abortions are currently legal only in Uruguay, Guyana, Mexico City and the Mexican state of Oaxaca. But pro-choice activists have become increasingly outspoken and there are signs that attitudes are starting to shift. A recent poll in Mexico showed that support for access to abortion rose dramatically in 2020, from 29% in March to 48% in November. Argentina’s government has pledged to ensure that criminal charges are dropped and judicial sentences suspended for more than 1,500 women and doctors accused of violating the ban.
“We have reports of 1,530 people who have either been sentenced or charged and we will be working to make sure those sentences are commuted and those charges are dropped,” Gómez Alcorta said. The actual number of women who have had to face the law over clandestine abortions is probably far higher, she said, as data has only been provided for 15 of the country’s 24 provinces. The new law is likely to face legal challenges but the minister said she was confident that the country’s supreme court would uphold it. Plans are also being put in place to overcome other kinds of resistance. “We know there will be resistance in the more conservative provinces where they might try to restrict access, so we are going to work to make sure that women are informed of where they can go to get an abortion.” The ministry will also ensure legal abortion is available free of charge at clinics nationwide, as the law stipulates. “There is certain to be resistance from private medical insurance plans against providing interventions free of charge, so we will be keeping an eye on that as well.”"
2021-01-14T18:54:53Z,global-development,Global development,Ugandans go to polls in election pitting Museveni against pop star MP,"Ugandans have cast their votes after one of the most keenly watched and violent election campaigns in a generation, as the pop star turned politician Bobi Wine tries to unseat Yoweri Museveni from his 34-year rule. Delays were seen in the delivery of polling materials in some places, including where Wine voted in the capital and opposition stronghold of Kampala. After he arrived to the cheers of a crowd and cast his ballot, Wine made the sign of the cross and then raised his fist and smiled. He said he was confident of victory. On Wednesday night internet access was cut off for most users, heightening fears of state-backed moves to compromise the election’s integrity, though some in the land-locked east African country are using VPNs to communicate online. At a polling station in Kampala’s Wakiso district, there were long queues as officials struggled to get biometric machines to work. “It’s so disappointing and frustrating,” said Daphine Ayereza, two hours after joining the queue to vote at 7am. “This is just a mess.” After polls closed at 4pm, hundreds of Wine supporters in Kampala returned to their polling stations to heed his call to “protect the vote” by watching the count. At the station where Wine had voted, security forces chased his supporters away. Results are expected within 48 hours. A candidate must win more than 50% to avoid a runoff vote. One of 10 opposition challengers, Wine has the backing of many young people in Uganda – where the median age is 15.7 – who are drawn to his charismatic, anti-corruption message. Many observers see the challenge to Museveni, who at 76 is twice as old as his challenger, as emblematic of a continent-wide generational struggle between ageing leaders who refuse to relinquish power and younger voters mobilising against them.
Wine’s supporters were violently suppressed during the campaign by security forces loyal to Museveni, whose bid for a sixth term in power was only made possible when MPs changed the constitution to remove age limits. He has repeatedly accused Wine of being a foreign-backed “traitor”. Helicopters and military tanks have patrolled the skies and empty streets of Kampala and other cities in recent days. More than 55 people died in November after Wine was officially confirmed as a candidate, and he has been detained and prevented from campaigning on multiple occasions. Members of his party and other opposition figures have been attacked and arrested, purportedly because of rallies held in breach of Covid-19 restrictions.
On Wednesday Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, said members of his security detail around his home had been ordered to leave. In recent weeks, security forces have aggressively shut down his campaign activities, including dragging him from his car during a press conference last week. In December Wine said his bodyguard had been killed by soldiers. In an interview with the Guardian at the turn of the year he described the campaign as “a war and a battlefield”. Lydia Namubiru, a journalist and the Africa editor at Open Democracy, said: “The brazenness of the violence is new. It’s both because he [Wine] is seen as a threat in the election but also because of what he symbolises.” On Tuesday Uganda’s communications regulator ordered internet providers to block all social media platforms and messaging applications until further notice, one day after Facebook announced it had taken down a network of fake and duplicate accounts linked to the information ministry. On Wednesday the US and EU said they would not observe the elections, after several officials were denied accreditation. Isabella Akiteng, a civil society activist, said late on Thursday that she and 29 others who were observing the polls had been arrested at a hotel in Kampala and were being interrogated by police. Museveni, who took power in 1986, enjoys widespread support, particularly among more conservative, rural and older voters who credit him with economic and healthcare gains and rural development. “I expect my candidate to win massively,” said Prima Mbazi, wearing the yellow cap of the ruling National Resistance Movement party in Kampala, on the eve of the vote. “He has offered free primary and secondary education for all children from families to study; we access health services in hospitals and at least every village has access to electricity. He needs to continue to secure our future.”
On the campaign trail, the memory of mass suffering in the past underlined Museveni’s message of stability and continuity. “When Museveni speaks, it’s all about how he rescued the country when basic services were nonexistent,” said Namubiru. “But people under the age of 35 have only a vague recollection of how things were then, and don’t feel they were liberated.” Moreover, Museveni’s message of economic progress jars with a harsh reality, particularly for younger people, more than 80% of whom work in the informal labour market. Criticism of political patronage under Museveni’s government has likewise grown in recent years. Elective positions have more than doubled since 2006 to almost 3 million officials – one for every 16 people – according to civil society groups. The difficulty of unseating powerful long-term rulers was on sharp display in Uganda’s 2016 election, and expectations of a fair and transparent vote this time around are low. At a polling station in the Kampala suburb of Mbuya, Joseph Okello said he had cast his ballot for Wine. “I am sure he will win with a landslide if they don’t manipulate the results and rig it,” Okello said."
2021-01-14T13:59:11Z,global-development,Global development,"Covid restrictions on visits to detained children and parents are 'cruel', MPs told","Children with parents in prison have been forgotten during lockdown, campaigners have told MPs. The cross-party human rights committee is looking at the impact on the right to family life, with a focus on people in institutional settings including prisons, care homes and mental health facilities. Relatives gave emotional evidence on Wednesday of the devastating impact of long periods without visits to children, parents and spouses. A message was played from children whose mother is in prison and whose short visits have become even more limited. A nine-year-old said: “I wish I could see my mum without it [the link] glitching and cutting out. I used to speak to her lots but she has moved now and I rarely get to speak to her.” It is estimated that 310,000 children each year have a parent in prison. Sarah Burrows is founder of Children Heard and Seen, a charity working to support children with parents in prison. She said that a difficult situation, offering only patchy contact with parents, has worsened during the pandemic because of a failure to focus on children. “Half the children we work with were not getting regular visits even before lockdown. Families are breaking down because of a lack of communication. “We can’t even give phone access equally across the system. The little boy who spoke today, his mother had in-cell phone access in one prison then was moved and now has to queue with 30 others for the phone. Some prisons restrict the number of children who can visit, and families have to pick a child.” Many prisons have been under pressure in the face of increasing Covid outbreaks and social visits are now almost entirely suspended.
Harriet Harman, chair of the committee, told the Guardian: “These are areas where there are already underlying problems … and now the pandemic has made this worse. “When the pandemic hits, it’s just, ‘oh ban all visits’. Why not ask how we can make visits safe? And if you are thinking about the right of the child to family life – perhaps give early release to the mother? “It’s about looking at it from the perspective of individual rights, and even within a pandemic these should be respected because the impact can be devastating. Think of young people with autism or the undermining of a child-mother relationship if prison visits are stopped for months.” The committee is also looking at the treatment of young people held in mental health facilities. A mother broke down as she listed the ways she had tried to reach her daughter, who is being held in an assessment and treatment centre. Despite “E” having the emotional age of a toddler, her parents have been refused permission to see her in person because of Covid restrictions. “She calls us and says: ‘I want my mummy.’ If the Zoom call goes over 10 minutes they take the iPad out of her hand – it is wrong. We have even been refused a window visit. “We cry every day. Our child is incarcerated and now because of Covid, I can’t even advocate for her. Social workers and police are allowed in, but a mother and father who have been with her 24 hours a day until she was detained are not allowed to look through a window – it is cruel, it is inhuman.” The inquiry will look in more detail at the impact of lockdown on human rights, following on from the committee’s first report in September last year. The government responded earlier this month with a full report on the findings, saying: “The central aim of the government’s response has been to protect lives. The coronavirus pandemic has had an unprecedented global impact that has severely affected public health, the economy and society. “Balancing consideration of the economic and social implications of restrictions with the need to protect public health and make sure the NHS does not become overwhelmed is challenging, but the government has been committed to a proportionate and flexible response.”"
2021-01-14T12:22:54Z,global-development,Global development,"Aid sector is 'last safe haven' for abusers, UK investigation warns","The sexual abuse and exploitation of local women by international aid workers remains “rife”, say MPs, describing the sector as the “last safe haven” for perpetrators. A parliamentary inquiry found evidence of widespread abuse of beneficiaries, ineffective investigations and whistleblowers forced out of jobs, despite a series of recent scandals that had prompted some reforms. Sexual predators could still be rehired because of inadequate safeguarding and reporting mechanisms, the international development committee (IDC) said, concluding that the culture of aid was a significant factor in the scale of the problem. The coronavirus pandemic is likely to have made the problem more acute, said the committee, as food shortages and aid cuts have exacerbated the vulnerability of mostly female aid recipients. Sarah Champion, chair of the IDC, said: “Our inquiry has found that abuse of beneficiaries is rife, and that the sector has effectively become the last safe haven for perpetrators. “Throughout the inquiry we heard repeatedly of abusers acting with impunity, whistleblowers being hounded out of their jobs and victims finding it impossible to secure justice.
“I know that the vast majority of aid workers are dedicated people, proud to serve beneficiaries, but until the perpetrators of exploitation and abuse are driven out of the sector, there remains a dark shadow across their good work.” Large international aid organisations could prevent sex abuse if they stopped their “patronising attitude” of imposing programmes without including beneficiaries and local groups in their design, Champion said. MPs acknowledged improvements had been made by the government, NGOs and the UN, after the Oxfam sexual abuse scandal in Haiti was exposed in 2018, including greater protections for whistleblowers and staff training. But they urged action across the sector to ensure robust reporting mechanisms for local people who were on the spot. In September last year, a year-long investigation by the Thomson Reuters Foundation and the New Humanitarian claimed women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were exploited by foreign aid workers. The abuse was described as an “open secret”, MPs said, yet “little was done” to stop it. There were also concerns that allegations were not always effectively investigated or reported to police, meaning abusers might escape punishment and move to new jobs. The inquiry was backed by a small survey, in which 73% of respondents said they believe sexual exploitation and abuse were still being perpetrated by aid workers, while 57% said their organisation’s whistleblowing policies were not strong enough. The report, published on Thursday, said introducing changes must not be a “box-ticking exercise” that fails to address the underlying culture that has allowed sexual exploitation to persist. It singled out the UN, saying it should not use rights of immunity from prosecution during missions as a shield to protect perpetrators. Helen Stephenson, chief executive of the Charity Commission for England and Wales, said the report made for “sombre reading”. As a regulator, it had strengthened its work, taking action where necessary and improving its whistleblowing procedures. “The commission, however, can only form part of the solution, and as the committee rightly recognises, action is required from governments and regulators around the world, the UN, as well as individual aid organisations and NGOs,” said Stephenson. The commission said it had conducted 181 inquiries, some of which related to safeguarding in 2020, compared with five in 2012. Stephanie Draper, CEO of Bond, welcomed the findings for putting beneficiaries first. “The aid sector should put these groups at the heart of developing programmes and reporting mechanisms and ensure communities know their rights,” she said. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said the government had set enhanced standards and vetting procedures and had published a safeguarding strategy covering the UK aid sector. “We are looking carefully at the IDC report as we continue efforts to stamp out abuse,” said a spokesperson. A UN spokesperson said: “The UN does not consider immunity to be a barrier to national investigation or national court litigation in cases of allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse.” This piece was edited on 15 January 2021 to clarify that not all of the 181 inquiries conducted by the commission in 2020 were related to safeguarding"
2021-01-14T07:45:32Z,global-development,Global development,Journeys of hope: what will migration routes into Europe look like in 2021?,"In 2020, tens of thousands of migrants crossed desert and sea, climbed mountains and walked through forests to reach what has become an increasingly inhospitable Europe. Many of them died, overwhelmed by the waves, or tortured in the detention centres of Libya. More were displaced after the flames of Moria refugee camp in Greece burned everything they had. As a new year begins, so do the journeys of tens of thousands more people seeking a new life overseas. The Guardian has spoken to experts, charity workers and NGOs about the challenges and risks they face on the main migration routes into Europe.
The Balkan route Migrants walk in protest to the Serbian-Hungarian border near Kelebija, Serbia, in February 2020. They seek a passage to the EU. Photograph: Bernadett Szabo/Reuters In July last year, seven north African men climbed into a shipping container in a railway yard in Serbia, hoping to emerge a few days later in Milan. Three months later, on 23 October, authorities in Paraguay found their badly decomposed bodies inside a shipment of fertiliser. Violence from security forces in the Balkan states has pushed people to take even greater risks to reach Europe. After the Serbian border with EU countries became virtually impassable in 2018, refugees began trying to reach Croatia via Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) instead. The path usually begins in Turkey, from which migrants attempt to reach Bulgaria or Greece, then North Macedonia or Serbia, then Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia, from where they can finally reach Italy or Austria.
The final leg of the Balkan route, which crosses mountains and snow-covered forests and lacks facilities for migrants, is one of the most perilous and gruelling, made worse by the brutal pushbacks carried out by squadrons of Croatian police who patrol the EU’s longest external border. Between January and November 2020, the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) recorded 15,672 pushbacks from Croatia to BiH. More than 60% of cases reportedly involved violence.
“The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 has decreased migration flows along the western Balkan route,” says Nicola Bay, DRC country director for Bosnia. Last year, 15,053 people arrived in BiH, compared with 29,196 in 2019. “But in the absence of real solutions the humanitarian situation for those entering BiH remains unacceptable and undignified.” In December, a fire destroyed a migrant camp in Bosnia, which had been built to contain the spread of Covid-19 among the migrant population. The same day the International Organization for Migration declared the effective closure of the facility. The destruction of the camp, which was strongly criticised by rights groups as inadequate due to its lack of basic resources, has left thousands of asylum seekers stranded in snow-covered forests and subzero temperatures. When countries in the region begin to ease Covid-19 restrictions this year, Bay says it is highly likely there will be a surge of arrivals to BiH, which remains the main transit point for those wanting to reach Europe – a scenario for which the EU and the region remain unprepared.
Greece Carrying children and their few possessions, migrants flee in Moria camp on the island of Lesbos, Greece. Photograph: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP/Getty Images On the night of 8 September, the Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos, the biggest of its kind in Europe, burst into flames. The government announced a four-month state of emergency on the island, as thousands of vulnerable asylum seekers were displaced. “This was one of the most terrible years for asylum seekers arriving in Greece,” says Stephan Oberreit, head of mission for Médecins Sans Frontières in Greece. “The combination of violence, Covid pandemic and the continued harmful policies of containment on the islands have led to several breaking points and eventually to the fires that have destroyed Moria.”
After the blaze, the EU said there would be no more Morias. But more than 15,000 men, women and children are still trapped in miserable conditions on the Greek islands and the policy of containment continues.
People using this route generally come by dinghy from the Turkish town of Ayvalik, aiming to reach Lesbos. Oberreit says that while arrivals have decreased this year, reports of illegal pushbacks have increased “in a concerning way”. “But let’s be realistic, people will continue to try to cross and risk their lives in the absence of other safer and legal options.” Oberreit says the pandemic “has been used by Greek authorities to accelerate their agenda to create closed centres on the Greek islands and to increase the border controls”. It’s hard to predict what will happen this year, “but the signs we have today give us little hope that the situation for the people who manage to arrive on the Greek islands will improve. Or that the EU will abandon its approach based on deterrence and containment,” he says.
Central Mediterranean Migrants are rescued by members of the Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms after leaving Libya on an overcrowded dinghy in November. Photograph: Sergi Camara/AP In mid-November, four shipwrecks in the space of three days claimed the lives of more than 110 people in the Mediterranean, including at least 70 people whose bodies washed up on the beach of al-Khums, in western Libya. Taking advantage of good autumn weather, people smugglers sent hundreds of migrants to sea. Many of the journeys ended in tragedy. Last year, at least 575 people died taking the central Mediterranean route. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) says the real number is considerably higher.
People using this route usually depart from Tripoli or Zuwara in Libya, or from Sfax in Tunisia, and make for the Sicilian island of Lampedusa or Malta in small boats. At the start of the pandemic, Italy and Malta declared their ports closed. Rome established “quarantine boats” – ferries on which migrants are placed under quarantine for 14 days, which have been criticised by human rights groups.
“There is not the adequate medical care on the ferries that these people badly need and not even legal assistance,” says Oscar Camps, founder of Proactiva Open Arms. “In such a situation, human rights are practically revoked.” Open Arms is now the only NGO rescue boat operating along the central Mediterranean route. Many other rescue boats are blocked in Italian ports because officials refuse to authorise their departure. Camps says he would like to see a planned civil or military rescue operation along the route this year, similar to Operation Mare Nostrum, which Italy ran in 2013–2014. “It should be an operation aimed at dismantling Libyan armed groups, falsely called coastguards, financed by the EU, whose only mission is to intercept boats and bring them back to a country at war,” says Camps. “However, considering the way things are going, we would settle for them stopping the criminalisation of rescue operations carried out by humanitarian ships.”
The Channel A migrant climbs into the back of a lorry bound for Britain at the entrance to the Channel tunnel in Calais, November 2020. Photograph: Denis Charlet/AFP/Getty Images Several thousand people attempted to cross the Channel to reach Britain last year. London has repeatedly pressed Paris to do more to prevent people leaving France. In November, the home secretary, Priti Patel, and her French counterpart, Gérald Darmanin, said they wanted to make the route unviable and signed a new agreement aimed at curbing the number of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats. More than 8,000 people made the crossing in small boats last year, up from almost 1,900 in 2019.
“The difficulties faced by women, men and children will in many ways remain the same as before,” says Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty’s refugee and migrant rights programme director. “Clearly, there is no will among the two governments – particularly not the UK – to directly address the needs and circumstances of these people to ensure they have access to asylum.”
According to experts, the future of the Channel migration route is linked to the continuing pandemic lockdowns and whether the UK participates in EU migration policies, specifically the EU family reunification programme. “Whether the UK will secure some agreement with the EU or with France in relation to this particular matter is uncertain,” says Valdez-Symonds. “All that can be said, as things stand, is that almost the sole formally sanctioned option for at least unaccompanied children with family in the UK to seek asylum here is about to close.” Sign up for the Global Dispatch newsletter – a fortnightly roundup of our top stories, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues:"
2021-01-14T07:15:31Z,global-development,Global development,Nigeria launches 'biggest job creation scheme' in its history after long delay,"Nigeria has launched a much-delayed programme that promises to provide jobs for more than 750,000 young people amid worsening youth unemployment. The scheme, launched this month, is being hailed by government officials as the largest job creation initiative in the country’s history. The 52bn naira ($136m) Special Public Works (SPW) programme will target low-skilled workers. From October, it offers three-month job placements, paying 20,000 naira ($53) a month, which is less than the minimum wage of 30,000 naira, but a significant help in a country where so many young people are without work. Since 2015, the number of under 24-year-olds who are unemployed has almost tripled to 14 million, 40% of the youth labour force, according to Nigeria’s National Bureau of Statistics. About 83 million of Nigeria’s population of 200 million live on less than $1 a day. President Muhammadu Buhari caused outrage in 2018 when comments he made at a Commonwealth event in London were widely interpreted as suggesting that young people in Nigeria caused their own joblessness. Months of dispute between politicians and the government over control of the initiative meant the much lauded programme has been delayed since the middle of last year. Politicians and officials have attracted criticism for wanting to take an active role in selecting young people in their constituencies who qualify for the programme.
In recent years, Nigeria’s economy has suffered from a combination of dwindling oil revenues and policies widely seen as harmful to small businesses. The economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic has added to the problems. According to the World Bank, the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak will push a further 5 million people into poverty. Festus Keyamo, Nigeria’s minister for labour and employment, said the jobs programme “is also aimed at shielding the most vulnerable from the ravaging effects of the Covid-19 pandemic”. “Our target is to immediately engage the 774,000 selected unemployed Nigerians for the programme to execute carefully selected projects,” he said. The SPW is one of a number of initiatives launched by the government to provide grants, loans or short-term jobs in an attempt to improve employment prospects. But the management and effectiveness of the SPW programme has been called into question. Critics have also said that short-term jobs, while offering much-need cash support and experience, do little to dent long-term unemployment and poverty. Last year, Nigeria’s parliament called for the programme to be halted, amid a power-tussle between MPs and the government minister in charge of the scheme. Many MPs want some control over the distribution of jobs. “It is worthwhile for us to know how the distribution of jobs to Nigerians and those who we are representing in our constituencies is handled,” one politician said, claiming the government was seeking to sideline MPs. The application process is via a government portal."
2021-01-13T06:30:01Z,global-development,Global development,'Untouchable' Bollywood poster provokes outrage over caste stereotypes,"A picture of a woman holding a broom. Anywhere else, the image might pass unnoticed. But in India the poster for the film Madam Chief Minister, loosely based on the life of politician Mayawati, who is a Dalit, has triggered uproar for perpetuating caste stereotypes. Bollywood actor Richa Chadha, who plays Mayawati, tweeted an image of the poster ahead of the film’s release later this month. She is shown looking dishevelled and holding the kind of large broom used by municipal roadsweepers. The tagline of the poster reads: Untouchable, Unstoppable. The poster has offended on many fronts. “Untouchable” is now an unacceptable term in India – although some Dalits are reclaiming it – and the actor’s unkempt appearance implies Dalits are unwashed and untidy. For Dalits who have strived to escape the hereditary, menial jobs that defined and dehumanised them, the broom is a particularly potent symbol. The outrage was instant. Chadha and director Subhash Kapoor were lambasted for being incapable – as upper-caste and privileged Hindus – of escaping simplistic conceptions of Dalits. Many expressed their views on Twitter. One wrote: “Over the years, Bollywood in the guise of breaking caste barriers and making progressive cinema has furthered caste prejudices and solidified symbols associated with discrimination. What does a Dalit leader going on to become CM have to do with holding broom?” Another tweeted: “UCs (who claim to be secular, liberal) understanding of casteism is always flawed. Apparently everybody wants to make movies on Dalits these days because it’s profitable and they in turn do more harm to the community.” While another wrote: “The recent poster of Madam Chief Minister makes me feel heartbroken once more. I lack words to talk about the deliberate reluctance of people to understand things. All so-called ‘progressive’ behaviour fails when it comes to how a Dalit is imagined in this country.”
Chadha dismissed the criticism as an example of “cancel culture” and urged her critics to see past the poster and appreciate the film’s “progressive and transformative” theme. Political theorist and author Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd said caste prejudice was so ingrained that those who created the image ignored the fact that Mayawati was educated and worked as a teacher before becoming, as leader of the Bahujan Samaj party, the first woman chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. She served four terms. “The director’s casteist mind and absolute stupidity [meant he] did not see her image with a human eye, rather he saw her image with a caste eye. Bollywood is so full of such casteist and foolish minds that they can hardly be expected to make what this film claims to be: a socially relevant and transformative film,” said Shepherd. Apart from a handful of new young Dalit directors who have emerged against the odds in recent years, the film industry has mostly failed to tackle the caste realities of India, despite being the single most powerful cultural force in the country, shaping the perceptions of millions of Indians. If Dalits are shown at all, it is as menial labourers or as victims of upper-caste exploitation leading brutalised and wretched lives. A few years ago, a film production house shared a casting call on Facebook looking for “an actor who looks like a Dalit”. Director Rajesh Rajamani, who poked fun at the idea of casting someone who “looks” like a Dalit in his short film The Discreet Charm of the Savarnas, said even on the rare occasions Bollywood broaches the subject of caste, the result is superficial. “Unfortunately, stories on adivasis [the indigenous tribes of India], Dalits and Muslims have become very commoditised. It has become an easy way for upper-caste film-makers to seem progressive and popular when they tell these stories,” Rajamani said in a recent interview."
2021-01-13T06:00:03Z,global-development,Global development,'Like torture’: Calais police accused of continued migrant rights abuses,"Shortly before sunrise on 9 January, about 40 officers and officials gathered outside Calais police station as temperatures dipped to -3C (26.6F). Shortly after, in a well-drilled procedure, a nine-vehicle convoy started down the road towards the first of five forced evictions of makeshift refugee camps planned for that morning. When the convoy arrived at the camp, just a few miles from the city centre, masked police in black uniforms chased refugees away from their tents and belongings. Some of the other 150 refugees who had been sheltering at the camp had already packed and fled before authorities arrived. Soon the camp was empty; frost-covered sleeping bags and jackets were all that remained. According to figures from Human Rights Observers (HRO), a non-profit that monitors police evictions in northern France, there were 973 evictions in Calais in 2020 – nearly three a day, and more than double the 452 recorded in 2018. In December alone, 526 tents were seized and 41 arrests were made. “It’s been like this for months,” said Isabella Anderson, an HRO field coordinator. “These constant evictions are part of a policy by the French government to wear down asylum seekers, to fatigue them and take away their hope. It’s like torture.” Although at several eviction sites, the Guardian was blocked by a perimeter of police, video evidence and first-hand accounts show what campaigners claim are persistent human rights violations during police operations including excessive use of force and destruction of personal property. Reported cases of police violence have included minors being teargassed, a tent with a refugee inside being dragged by a tractor and an Eritrean shot in the face with a rubber bullet from 10 metres, hospitalising him for two months. The evictions are on a rolling 48-hour schedule to prevent refugees acquiring limited rights and the police requiring a court order to clear the land. “They come at 5am, circle around your tent and cut it with knives,” said Abdul*, a 20-year-old from Sudan who has been in Calais for five months, camping in the bushes in the hope of one day crossing to the UK by boat or lorry. “It has happened to me so many times. They treat us like animals, not humans. In Sudan there is war, people are killed, women are raped. But in some ways, it is better than here.” Nasser*, an Afghan refugee who turned 18 in December, said the constant evictions had affected his mental health. “The police keep coming,” he said. “You would think maybe if it rains they would not come, but they do. They even came on New Year’s when everyone was happy and it was a holiday. They take our stuff and we have to be outside for many hours – sometimes 10 to 12 hours. They don’t care if I’m a minor.”
Most evictions are carried out using “flagrance”, a measure which allows police to remove occupants of private land if there has been a complaint and they have been there for less than 48 hours. Some lead to arrests and deportations, but often refugees flee and later return. Lawyers say the evictions are harassment and a breach of UN and French human rights law, with the emergency measure – intended for gathering facts about a crime – deployed “wrongly and permanently”. “It is a complete abuse of the system,” said Margot Sifre, who specialises in evictions for legal support charity Cabane Juridique. “Under normal circumstances, an eviction requires the authorisation of a judge, a social diagnosis to identify vulnerable people, and preparation to provide rehousing solutions. But under flagrance, which should be a short-term measure, there is no legal basis and no opportunity to appeal.” Bastien Roland, a lawyer working in Calais, said the tactics were “deliberately vague and difficult to contest”. He added: “The government spends millions of euros to slow these refugees down. They will still try to cross to England, but with how many traumas?”
Larger-scale evictions, described as “sheltering” operations, involving the dispersal of refugees to centres around the country, are carried out by French authorities through court orders. On 29 September, nearly 800 people were evicted in an area known as Hospital, one of 15 such operations last year. After the destruction of the Calais “Jungle” camp in 2016 and another large makeshift camp last September, the evictions are seen by the French authorities as a key weapon in preventing similar “fixing points” being established by the estimated 1,200 refugees now in Calais and Dunkirk, which include pregnant women and children. Humanitarian groups working in northern France say that in recent months conditions have worsened and that the evictions have become relentless.
About 150 people now sleep under bridges in Calais city centre, where charities are banned from distributing food, but on 24 December an order for eviction was granted by the administrative court of Lille, which is expected to take place imminently. “I don’t know what I will do if they evict us,” said Mohammed*, a 17-year-old Algerian currently sleeping under the Mollien Bridge. “Their strategy is to weaken us. But if everything was fine in our countries, we wouldn’t have left. We don’t have the choice.” The prefecture of Pas-de-Calais said in a statement that the evictions “put an end to illegal occupations … with a twofold objective: to prevent the reconstitution of insalubrious camps and to provide shelter for the migrant population”. It added: “The action of the police during these operations responds to strict rules of ethics.” * Names have been changed"
2021-01-13T05:00:01Z,global-development,Global development,Wole Soyinka: 'One casualty of the Capitol riot will be Uganda's election',"Global outrage at the storming of the US Capitol risks diverting attention from repression by Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni, the Nigerian playwright Wole Soyinka has said on the eve of Uganda’s election. Soyinka, a Nobel laureate and one of Africa’s most prominent literary figures, described Thursday’s election as “crucial for the African continent”, and called for the 76-year-old Museveni and other older African leaders to step aside for a younger generation. The fierce challenge to Museveni’s 34-year rule by reggae singer turned politician Bobi Wine has inspired younger generations in Uganda and across the continent, Soyinka said. “To me, he represents the spirit of Africa’s future,” Soyinka said of Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi. “People of my generation should understand when it’s time for us to give way to new blood, new thinking, more attuned to contemporary society,” the 86-year-old said from his home in the city of Abeokuta, south-west Nigeria. Addressing the riot by a mob of Donald Trump’s supporters in Washington DC last week, Soyinka said: “It is really sad that this absolutely unprecedented event has taken place in the States right now. My regret about that principally has to do with us on this continent. I know that one of the casualties will be the election in Uganda. “Attention is going to be taken away, even the little attention it has received. When America stumbles, it is a big blow to democracy in other parts of the world. Dictators take courage from that. We must expect over the next year at least, even further steps backwards as a result of what has happened.” Soyinka, a prominent pro-democracy activist and a political prisoner for almost two years during military rule in Nigeria in 1967, said democratic gains achieved in Africa after the end of apartheid in South Africa had receded in many African countries under leaders such as Museveni who once fought for those freedoms. Museveni came to power in the years after the removal of the brutal Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. “It is this cause of human freedom that he is now betraying. He has become in effect the very thing he fought against,” Soyinka said. “Museveni’s going to fight to the end, and he’s going to continue to fight dirty because he believes power is his natural birthright.”
Many Ugandans have been drawn to Wine’s anti-establishment campaign message, which has come to represent the growing dissonance between elderly African autocrats and the youngest and fastest-growing populations in the world. The response by Museveni and his security agents has been brutal. Wine, his campaign team and his supporters have been repeatedly arrested, attacked and since he declared his candidacy in November. Dozens have been killed. “I consider it a crime against the future … for initiatives like his to be stymied, to be brutalised,” Soyinka said. The lack of an international response has emboldened repressive actions within Uganda, he said. “The first contribution that the international community can make, especially the African community, is to serve notice to Museveni that he will be treated like a pariah if he engages in skullduggery over this election. That he’s got to play by the rules and he’s got to allow the opposition a voice,” he said.
On Tuesday, Uganda’s communications regulator ordered internet providers to block all social media platforms and messaging applications until further notice, heightening fears of state-backed moves to compromise the election’s integrity. Facebook and Twitter were among apps that became inaccessible on several network providers in the country. Facebook had on Monday announced it had taken down a network of fake and duplicate accounts linked to the country’s information ministry. Soyinka, who will release his first novel in 48 years later this year, has long been an outspoken critic of autocracy in Africa. Museveni, who promised democracy when he came to power in 1986 and enjoyed widespread support among leaders in the US and Europe in the 1990s, is a one-time ally. During the fight to remove the Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha, “we had a long chat”, Soyinka said. “I was impressed by his commitment [but] I wasn’t impressed by his intelligence … In fact I remember when we were in Davos and we were on a podium and afterwards I met some of his people and I said: ‘Look, just tell your man not to talk about things he doesn’t understand.’ And you know what one of them said? He said: ‘Look at you. You only had him for a few minutes. We have him all the time!’ “He’s a cunning man, he was a determined man, but he’s not necessarily the best thing going in Uganda.” A recent resurgence of third-term bids and attempts to change constitutions has drawn mass criticism in Africa. “It’s the whole story of one step forward, several steps backward,” Soyinka said.
“Look at what’s happening electorally around the continent – Guinea, Ivory Coast. These people [are] changing the constitution to keep themselves in power and what do they do with it when they get power? The same old business, same old stagnation.” Last year, Ivory Coast’s president, Alassane Ouattara, won a controversial third term, running for office after previously pledging to step down. Soyinka said: “Who would have thought for instance that someone like Ouattara, under whatever excuse, will change the constitution to allow himself to do that? Then you have Togo, running a dynastic regime,” he said, referring to President Faure Gnassingbé, in power in the tiny west African country since 2005 and who was appointed by his father, who had governed since 1967. “A successful campaign by Bobi Wine will be seen as a morale-boosting event all around the continent,” he said. “When I see young people like Bobi Wine making the effort I feel re-energised.”"

The humanitarian crises, which included violence in Guatemala, hunger in Madagascar and natural disasters in Papua New Guinea, were largely swept aside by news of Covid-19, global Black Lives Matter protests and more clickbait-friendly events such as the Eurovision song contest and Kanye West’s bid for the US presidency; the latter two each received 10 times more online news attention than the humanitarian crises in question, the report found. The lack of media coverage adds to existing burdens for the 10 countries in crisis, including the effects of pandemic restrictions and the growing impact of climate change, said Care’s humanitarian advocacy coordinator and UN representative Delphine Pinault. “Covid-19 has shown us that humanitarian crises can occur anywhere, but for so many people, especially women and girls, Covid-19 is just another threat on top of what they must face already,” said Pinault. “We must not be silent while the world ignores crises that started long before Covid-19 and yet still have not been addressed.” An estimated 235 million people globally are expected to need humanitarian aid this year, an increase of 40% from 2020, according to data from the UN.
Africa was home to six of the 10 most underreported humanitarian crises of 2020, according to Care, with a number of nations – including Burundi, Central African Republic (CAR) and Madagascar – appearing in the list year after year. The report points to violence and conflict in Burundi, CAR and Mali; hunger and drought in Madagascar and Zambia, and poverty and climate concerns in Malawi. Only one country in Europe – Ukraine – featured on Care’s list, where about 5 million people needed humanitarian aid last year and women hired out their wombs for money. Food insecurity in Guatemala, conflict in Pakistan and hunger and earthquakes in Papua New Guinea also saw these nations make the ranking. Care is urging governments to allow journalists better access to report “forgotten crisis” stories, and calling on global media to amplify the voices of women and girls and to partner with smaller, more local organisations to pay attention to news on the ground. “When a crisis doesn’t make headlines, it often doesn’t receive sufficient humanitarian funding, either,” the report warns. “The publication of Care’s neglected crises report is therefore a call to action to the humanitarian and donor community to not turn a blind eye.”"

In a third, a man in Damanhour, in the Nile delta, gasps for air, glassy-eyed as he holds an oxygen mask in his hand. “There is a lack of oxygen,” he says, extending an invitation for local health minister to come and witness the problem. “Join us, minister.” The footage has led to widespread concern in Egypt that there is a shortage of medical oxygen for Covid-19 patients as the country grapples with a rapid rise in infections and deaths. The government has denied any suggestion of a shortage, looking to reassure citizens during a pandemic that has been marked by a lack of accurate information – including about the level of vital supplies.
Medical oxygen is crucial for treating Covid-19. The World Health Organization estimates that one in every five Covid-19 patients “suffers respiratory distress sufficient to require oxygen therapy”. But the slightest issue with a hospital’s oxygen delivery system or the supply chain needed to refill oxygen cylinders – even something as benign as heavy traffic – can be fatal. Last week seven patients were rushed between the intensive care units of two hospitals in Sharqiya, after the oxygen delivery network failed. Egyptian authorities moved quickly to quash the notion of oxygen shortages. The governor of Sharqiyah, Mamdouh Gharab, said four deaths at Hussainiya hospital were not due to a shortage of oxygen but complications from Covid-19, while accusing hospital security of being lax for allowing patients’ relatives to enter and film in the wards. Sayed Rahmo, MP-elect of Sharqiyah, said five people had died as a result of staff negligence, claiming staff had mismanaged the depleted oxygen supplies. Public prosecutors later launched an inquiry into the deaths of seven patients at Hussainiya. Egypt’s national news has repeatedly referred to an “oxygen crisis” in hospitals, while officials have blamed individuals for allegedly trading or stockpiling supplies. Al-Azhar, the highest Sunni Muslim religious institution, has issued a fatwa against “hoarding medical supplies”.
Health minister Hala Zayed insisted that there was no shortage of medical oxygen, while the ministry’s spokesperson, Khaled Megahead, said the government had installed a new electronic system to monitor the supply of hospital beds and medical oxygen around the country. Prime minister Mostafa Madbouly demanded that producers double production of medical oxygen. “The main problem is that there’s a lack of trust in what the government says, which is the real issue,” said Ayman Sabae, head of the healthcare startup Shamseya. “When the health ministry says it wasn’t an oxygen problem, people doubt this for many reasons. These things occurred in hospitals run by the ministry of health, which is also carrying out an investigation [into the deaths]. Then there are conflicting messages: On one hand, the government is saying there’s no shortage of the supply of oxygen, then you see civil society organisations collecting funds and donating oxygen tanks.” Egyptian authorities have suppressed efforts to discuss shortages.
Ahmed Mamdouh, who filmed in Hussainiya hospital, was questioned shortly afterwards by security forces. Prosecutors also summoned the hospital director and four doctors for questioning. This month the health ministry suspended and disciplined the director of a hospital in Kafr al-Sheikh who appealed on Facebook for oxygen cylinders. The ministry later reversed his suspension, but not disciplinary proceedings. Last year, security forces detained at least eight medical personnel for discussing the government’s handing of the pandemic. Concern about a lack of oxygen supplies during a second wave of Covid-19 highlights the struggles of countries across the Middle East and Africa. One medical supply specialist in Zimbabwe tweeted about a desperate search for oxygen cylinders. Reports from South Africa suggest that hospitals are attempting to increase the supply of oxygen before the expected peak of the second wave in mid-January. Doctors across Africa said that a shortage of oxygen cylinders due to two companies dominating the market was putting patients at risk. Oxygen supplies have been contentious since the start of the pandemic. In Iraq last July, families of Covid-19 patients seized oxygen tanks from the storage area of a teaching hospital amid fears supplies were about to run dry. Egypt is recording more than 1,000 cases of the virus each day, but even health officials have admitted this is likely to be an undercount as there is no mass testing strategy. Zayed said her ministry’s official daily case count represented 10% of the likely cases. Many citizens avoid government-run hospitals until cases are advanced, meaning those admitted require more care. “If we continue to have infections at this rate in Cairo, the hospitals will collapse and things will go out of control,” said a doctor working in Imbaba, Giza, who asked not to be identified. “Also, if doctors continue to die at this fast rate, we will enter a crisis,” they added.
The Egyptian Medical Syndicate reported that 290 doctors have died from Covid-19 so far. The doctor working in Imbaba said monitoring efforts were in place to check on oxygen supplies, but doubted that the government’s new measures would be effective if cases continued rising. “Many things can go wrong due to the lack of transparency and the fact that no one wants to take responsibility. Several examples have shown that when doctors speak up they are the ones who are taken as a scapegoat and are blamed. The new measures will work just fine when the minster or a big official is visiting, but when we are overrun by patients they will not work,” they said. Sabae said the biggest risk to Egypt’s healthcare infrastructure is pressure on staff. “The major defect is not infrastructure like the number of beds, it revolves around a potential shortage of medical personnel. Even all the money in the world can’t replicate trained doctors and nurses. This is a major concern … that we could reach a level where the medical personnel we have are completely overwhelmed with cases.”"
2021-01-11T08:30:14Z,global-development,Global development,'There is no noise': inside the controversial Bhasan Char refugee camp – a photo essay,"I wanted to come here. No one forced me, and my wife also agreed in a snap. To be honest, though, I didn’t tell my brother. He lives where I used to live – Kutupalong camp. He is very against this island for some reason. He might have tried to stop me coming if I dared to discuss the topic. So I didn’t. I only told him after I arrived. I was amazed that he didn’t yell at me. Instead he wondered if he would ever see me again and even got a bit emotional.
‘The children have nothing to do but play. They said school will start soon’ Now when we phone each other, we compare facts and figures. On the island, we get 15kg of rice per head. They get only 13kg in the camps. We get 500g more dal and 1kg more potatoes here too. I am winning so far in our comparisons. We have been here just over one month. We are getting used to it.
‘I heard from one journalist that they spent $350m on this island. He told me I should be happy. I should not complain about anything’ For some reason, I don’t sleep properly. When I lie awake, in the dead of night, I can hear the sea and sometimes the horn of berthing ships. I feel a bit strange then but by the morning that feeling goes away. My children ask if their little friends from our neighbourhood back in the camp will come to the island. I really don’t know what to tell them. I guess they will find new friends here soon when their school starts.
There are a lot of children here, and when they play and get noisy it makes this island feel better, to tell you the truth –and less abnormal. The buildings are all the same here. We live on the ground floor. There are some tall buildings. Refugees are not permitted on the upper floors. Maybe they think we will kill ourselves?
‘Right now this place is OK. But with thousands more, I am not sure’ We can only ascend if there is a cyclone. Those floors are used by administration and [for] other purposes. When I think of the camp, I miss getting together with my mates in our favourite tea stalls after Maghrib or Isha prayers. I miss the Burmese tea and coffee mixes we get in the camps like Rich Mix. And I miss boma lapase, which you mix with water. That stuff is addictive.
‘Most of the refugees here I think are children. Without children this place would seem even more abnormal’ I feel sad and guilty about my parents. I guess I also abandoned those kids I used to give private tuition to. I worry about them. If I hadn’t fallen into debt and if the thugs in the camp didn’t harass me like they used to – so much so that I feared for my life – I guess I wouldn’t be here. God knows. Most of all, I hope my parents will forgive me some day.
‘In the camp, there is a lot of noise. Here there is no noise. Sometimes we hear a ship sound. It is very strange’"
2021-01-11T07:15:12Z,global-development,Global development,Aid spending in Africa must be African-led – it needs a Black Lives Matter reckoning | Dedo Baranshamaje and Katie Bunten-Wamaru,"While the US continues to reckon with its long-simmering struggle against racial injustice, it is important to remember that racism is not just a homegrown problem – we are also exporting it. As we begin 2021, global philanthropy has an opportunity to address this. In the US, black-led organisations are on average 24% smaller in terms of revenue, with 76% less unrestricted funding – the gold standard of grant-making. If you are a woman of colour leading a nonprofit, your odds of being funded are even lower, with a minuscule 0.6% of foundation funding targeted at this group. Worldwide, more than 99% of humanitarian and philanthropic funding goes to predominantly white-led international NGOs. Despite Africa’s growing and dynamic social sector, only 5.2% of US foundation giving to Africa goes to African-led organisations. Global giving to Africa needs its own Black Lives Matter reckoning.
There is power in proximity. Shifting our giving to prioritise leaders who are African is not only more just – it is more effective. When the global pandemic hit, guess which NGOs pulled staff and fled the continent? Here’s a hint: it wasn’t the locally led organisations. Just as with endless previous crises, African-led organisations have risen to the occasion and delivered to communities when others cannot. This isn’t new. Grassroots organisations are consistently delivering impact at the frontlines – without the benefit of frontline funding. Across a portfolio of 200 African partners at Segal Family Foundation, we have repeatedly seen local leaders innovate and iterate, combine resources, and network to respond and rebuild. There are myriad reasons African-led organisations in Africa do not get the attention or funding they deserve. There are multiple, overlapping barriers that allow this inequity to persist: lack of proximity to funder networks, philanthropy’s definitions of risk that do not value lived experience, lack of formally recognised status and well-documented implicit bias. But we can overcome that. We can fund groups that live, breathe, work and speak even the most nuanced language of their communities. At this moment, when we see funders starting to apply new, equity-based approaches to funding black-led organisations and movements in the US, we must also apply those approaches to funding across Africa. The African Visionary Fund is a new pooled fund, seeded by a group of US foundations, designed to drive millions of dollars in unrestricted funding to African-led organisations. We do the due diligence, advocate for our partners and make grants directly to African leaders to accelerate their impact.
Unlike many other philanthropic collaborations, the foundations also ceded power about how the fund will work and where the grants will go. The African Visionary Fund’s founding work group is both majority-African and majority-doer, not donor. This means the way the fund does grant-making and supports grantees is grounded in the experiences of those it seeks to support. The fund will commit more than $1m (£740,000) in grants this month and is on its way to raising $10m by 2023 to support African visionaries to accelerate their impact. While philanthropy often moves slowly, the African Visionary Fund hopes to be a bridge to get resources into the hands of people who can deliver impact now. We have a unique opportunity, in this moment, to chart a more equitable future globally. There are some key questions that would help grant-makers to make things fairer and better – from simply looking to see how many investments go to white-led organisations or social enterprises to tracking it, measuring it, questioning it. Asking about the diversity and questioning their own risk assessing – is local knowledge and lived experience being calculated? Anti-racism work is a long game – philanthropy is not going to change overnight. But this is the time to start. We need to stop the perennial habit of analysis paralysis and find ways to move money now. We are in an unprecedented moment of uprising and change in the world. If philanthropy is willing to acknowledge failings, practise radical imagination and take swift action, we are poised to unlock transformational change. Innovative, tenacious and optimistic African leaders are meeting the hopes and aspirations of their communities every day. Let’s meet that with the recognition and investment that they deserve. • Dedo Baranshamaje is director of innovation at the Segal Family Foundation.

2021-01-11T05:00:10Z,global-development,Global development,'Agent of foreign interests': Museveni lashes out at Uganda election rival,"As Uganda readies for an election on Thursday, President Yoweri Museveni is doubling down on his main rival and preparing himself for a sixth term in office. After 35 years in power, he faces a powerful opponent, the popular singer Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, 38, known by his stage name Bobi Wine, who has captured the hearts of a new generation by protesting against corruption and youth unemployment. Speaking at his ranch in Kisozi, west of the capital, Museveni said Wine was “an agent of foreign interests” promoting homosexuality. “Western elements”, especially Europeans from countries he declined to name, were backing his rival, Museveni said in an interview. “He gets quite a lot of encouragement from foreigners and homosexuals,” he said. “Homosexuals are very happy with Bobi Wine. I think they even send him support.” Traditionally, homosexuality was tolerated in Uganda but in recent years evangelist pastors with a large following have whipped up hatred of gay people, turning it into a political issue. Wearing a shirt in sunshine yellow – the colour of his National Resistance Movement – Museveni sat on a red plush velvet chair under an acacia tree, as aides fussed around with a fly swat, wipes and tissues. Determined that the 76-year-old leader should not contract coronavirus, everyone on the ranch wore masks. A young man in beige jeans and a pale shirt that partially hid the pistol on his belt wielded a huge bottle of disinfectant that he sprayed randomly in the air. A TV microphone was removed for extra sanitising, before being placed half a metre from the president.
Museveni, who came to power in 1986 by defeating Milton Obote in a bush war, said he was still “a freedom fighter.” After the atrocities committed by Obote and previously by Idi Amin, he stabilised the country and encouraged foreign investment. However, Uganda remains amongst the poorest countries in the world. Three-quarters of Ugandans were not born in 1986, and most young voters are more concerned about finding a job than about wars gone by. “Those youth who feel marginalised, that’s a healthy internal force,” said the president, pointing out that young people had only survived because of immunisation programmes he had introduced. He denied that his age was a barrier to re-election, even though, back in 1986 he wrote that “the problem of Africa in general and Uganda in particular is not the people but leaders who want to overstay in power.” In 2005, Uganda’s parliament removed the two-term limit for presidents, and in 2018 amended the constitution to allow candidates over 75 years to run, paving the way for Museveni to contest this year. Like Robert Mugabe, who also railed against colonialists and gay people, and who ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years until he was ousted in a coup at the age of 93, Museveni sees no reason to step down.
“You think the problem of Uganda is because I’ve been in government for a long time,” he said. “But we don’t agree with that – as long as it is decided on democratically.” How democratic the election will be is open to question. In the past few weeks, several of Wine’s associates have been killed or arrested. He has been banned from campaigning, detained and beaten on multiple occasions, supposedly because rallies breach Covid restrictions. Last Friday, Johnson Byabashaija, Uganda’s commissioner general of prisons, said that there was plenty of room in prison for an expected spike in arrests during election week. In November, at least 54 people were shot dead by security forces after Wine’s supporters rioted protesting against his arrest. While acknowledging that the security forces pulled the trigger, Museveni blamed the opposition for the killings, including those of passers-by. “The opposition are the ones who wanted to organise an insurrection because they want to organise here what happened in Libya,” he said. “Some died in crossfire.” In the town of Madu, a few miles north of Museveni’s ranch, Wine’s sister, Betty Ssentamu, who is running for parliament, was roaring around in a minivan decorated with pictures of herself and her brother. Wearing a scarlet and gold basuti, a traditional long dress, with a headband reading “People Power” tied round her long braids, she shouted to the crowd, “I have come to challenge everyone! Bobi Wine is the only president who fights for equal rights, and for the common person!” Dozens of boda bodas – motorcycle taxis – hurtled around with her, the riders punching their fists in the air as bystanders cheered and danced. The spontaneous rally was illegal, and Wine knows that he will be detained if he tries to campaign in similar fashion this week.
Speaking in the garden of his house near Kampala, attired in dark red narrow trousers and a shirt patterned with Chinese-style dragons, he said that he could see in himself something of the youthful freedom fighter Museveni had once been. “I used to adore Gen Museveni,” he said. “When we were children every plane that passed we would cry, ‘Hi Museveni!’, but slowly he has become a despicable character.” If Wine were to win a majority of the votes, and the electoral commission permitted him to declare victory – by no means a certainty – it is unclear whether the institutions of state would accept the result. The military, the police and the ministries are loyal to Museveni. The Special Forces Group, headed by the president’s son Lt Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, provides him with a personal armed force, while secret intelligence agents operate a parallel security structure. “What you should realise is that, in the case of Uganda, the person you’re talking to is very experienced,” said Museveni. “There are not many things in the world that I don’t know. So, when I’m handling a situation, you should know that I know what I’m doing.” Lindsey Hilsum is International Editor for Channel 4 News Sign up for the Global Dispatch newsletter – a fortnightly roundup of our top stories, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues:"
2021-01-08T08:00:32Z,global-development,Global development,'We can't cope': Lesotho faces Covid-19 disaster after quarantine failures,"A Covid-19 disaster is threatening the small southern African kingdom of Lesotho after revelations that the government released people who had tested positive for the virus from quarantine early. Government sources this week said they had been sending Covid-19 patients home from as far back as last June over cost concerns. It comes as the country, the last in Africa to record a case of the virus, recorded a sharp rise in cases in recent weeks after high numbers of workers travelled home from South Africa for the Christmas holidays. According to the latest figures from the National Covid-19 Secretariat (Nacosec), Lesotho had 4,137 cases as of Wednesday, up from 2,137 on 1 December. The country has a population of about 2 million. Moeketsi Majoro, the prime minister, has responded by imposing an 8pm curfew, closing bars and nightclubs, banning sports and closing schools. It came as South African immigration officials estimated that, since Monday, more than 100 travellers a day from Lesotho were testing positive at border points. The department of home affairs said that those who tested positive for the virus were being turned back, except for South African citizens, who were being quarantined. Of about 130,000 people who have entered Lesotho from South Africa since the beginning of December, just 20% had Covid clearance certificates and only about 39,000 were tested for the virus. Thousands more people are believed to have crossed the border illicitly, unable to afford the 800-rand (£38) Covid-19 test, and seven bodies were recovered from the Mohokare River in the last week of December. Police say others are still missing.
On Wednesday several minibuses transporting Basotho people without Covid-19 clearance certificates were stopped by the police in South Africa. A Lesotho government source told the Guardian authorities had stopped quarantining travellers because most of those sent to the facilities were not showing symptoms. He said it was decided that seriously ill patients would be sent to hospital. However, the hospitals are also overwhelmed.
“We did away with quarantine facilities in June because most of the people sent there were not even showing signs, hence it was a strain on our already thin budget. It was decided that only those who were seriously ill would be sent to hospital. We now owe them [the quarantine centres] over R100m rand (about £4.8m),” the source said. Nacosec risk communications manager Baroane Phenethi said new quarantine facilities were now being identified. “We never anticipated a surge. We are trying to identify quarantine facilities for those who are asymptomatic. Those who are visibly sick would be sent to hospitals,” Phenethi said. He warned of more deaths in the coming weeks. Lesotho authorities have been overwhelmed because of the huge cross-border traffic with South Africa, where cases have also risen exponentially over the festive period. “We are anticipating a rise in cases and even deaths. Cases are rising because people crossed [into Lesotho from South Africa] through illegal borders and are only being tested now when they are returning to South Africa. What’s worse is that the new Covid-19 variant is more severe than the one we had during the first wave,” Phenethi said. Last week the government said it would ensure that at least 200 people a day were tested for Covid-19 in each of the country’s 10 districts. Motlatsi Maqelepo, the health minister, said this would ensure 2,000 results daily. However, a tour of the Maseru testing centre at Makoanyane primary school in Ha Leqele this week revealed that fewer than 100 people were being tested each day. A health worker who wished to remain anonymous said the dire situation was worsening. “The system is overwhelmed and it cannot cope with the huge numbers. Of course, the minister said 2,000 results would be available daily but that is ambitious. “We have a colleague here at Queen Mamohato Memorial hospital who was tested in December and results were expected on the next day. She got confirmation that she had Covid-19 after the hospital authorities begged the laboratory to speed up the process on 2 January. She died two days later. “The situation is bad and we cannot cope.”"
2021-01-08T07:15:30Z,global-development,Global development,"Kenya faces $62bn bill to mitigate climate-linked hunger, drought and conflict","Kenya needs $62bn (£46bn) to mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis in the next 10 years, according to a government document sent to the UN framework convention on climate change. It equates to almost 67% of Kenya’s GDP. The report illustrates the scale of the challenge as the country aims to cut greenhouse gases by 32% within the next decade. It will rely on international sources to fund close to 90% of the expenditure. Securing such a colossal amount of often contentious climate financing from rich countries yet to honour their commitments to the $100bn target pledged during the 2015 Paris agreement will be a tall order. Kenya accounts for less than 0.1% of global greenhouse gas emissions and has a per capita emission of less than half the global average. But low-emitting countries such as Kenya are suffering the most from the effects of climate change, and are poorly equipped to effectively respond or build resilience to key hazards such as drought and flooding. For example, a 2011 drought in Kenya caused damage estimated at $11bn, while another in 2014-18 left 3.4 million people in food insecurity and half a million lacking access to water. In 2018, floods displaced 230,000 people in Kenya, including 150,000 children, drowned 20,000 livestock and led to the closure of 700 schools.
The country also lost 8,500 hectares (21,000 acres) of crops in a country where 84% of the land is “arid and semi-arid, with poor infrastructure and other developmental challenges, leaving less than 16% of the land to support over 80% of the population”. Such losses, the document says, continue to knock about 3-5% off the country’s GDP. Food security, warns the report, will worsen because Kenyan farmers are almost entirely weather-dependent. In addition, major rivers are seeing reduced flow as glaciers on the country’s biggest water tower, Mount Kenya, shrink. They are already down to 17% of their original size and will disappear in 30 years, the report says. Erratic rainfall has hampered hydroelectric generation and forced Kenya to look at exploiting 400m tonnes of coal reserves with proposals to build two power plants: one using local coal and the other imported coal. Providing cheap fuel will come with negative environmental and social impacts. The report says: “The use of coal is accompanied by strong environmental impacts, such as high emissions of sulphur dioxide, heavy metals and harmful greenhouse gases. The country is therefore faced with choosing between the exploitation of her fossil fuel resources to realise her development objectives and forgoing their exploitation for environmental reasons. To forgo all the benefits of exploiting the fossil fuel resources, Kenya will need significant international support.”
The climate crisis is also having an impact on national security with the scramble for meagre natural resources leading to violent conflicts. The report says: “Increased intensities and magnitudes of climate-related risks in Kenya aggravate conflicts, mostly over natural resources. This has frequently forced the country to reallocate development resources to address climate-related emergencies.”
Research by Imperial College Business School and Soas University of London for the UN in 2018 showed how developing countries lack the resources required to stem the tide of climate crisis, with the lack of resilience and mitigation measures driving them into unsustainable debt. “For every 10 dollars paid in interest by developing countries, an additional dollar will be spent due to climate vulnerability. This financial burden exacerbates the present-day economic challenges of poorer countries. The magnitude of this burden will at least double over the next decade,” the research findings state. Kenya, a member of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, has in recent years seen debt at critical levels with a November economic update from the World Bank showing debt to GDP rising from 62.4% of GDP in June 2019 to 65.6% in June 2020. Without affordable climate financing, the convention on climate change says any investments in these counties will have to factor risks from climate vulnerability with corresponding increased debt repayments."
2021-01-07T17:05:17Z,global-development,Global development,Guatemala mine's ex-security chief convicted of Indigenous leader's murder,"A judge in Guatemala has accepted a guilty plea by the former head of security at Central America’s largest nickel mine who was on trial for killing an Indigenous leader, in a rare conviction over human rights violations allegedly linked to Canadian-owned mining companies in the region. Mynor Padilla was found guilty on Wednesday of homicide for the 2009 fatal shooting of Adolfo Ich, a Maya Q’eqchi’ teacher and community leader who opposed the Fenix mine outside the town of El Estor.
“We have spent a long time seeking justice,” Angélica Choc, Ich’s widow, told the Guardian outside the courthouse, in Puerto Barrios, a port city 185 miles east of Guatemala City, following the ruling. “It is not going to bring my husband back, but I feel satisfied.” Transnational mining corporations, most of them Canadian, their personnel, and state security forces have been accused by human rights groups of a litany of abuses in Central America, including the killings of mine opponents. Prosecutions are rare, and criminal convictions of mining company personnel are almost unheard of in the region. Patricia Quinto, who represented Choc, a joint plaintiff in the trial, said that the verdict set an important precedent in the country. “The judge noted mining companies have generated conflicts,” said Quinto. At the time of the killing, the Fenix mining project was owned by Toronto-based Hudbay Minerals, which faced opposition from local Indigenous communities to plans to reopen the mine. The company faces ongoing civil lawsuits in Canada related to violence against Indigenous residents, including Ich’s killing. “We will review the court’s written decision once it is released. Any agreements made in the Guatemalan court do not affect our view of the facts or Hudbay’s liability in relation to civil matters currently before the Ontario court,” a Hudbay Minerals spokesperson told the Guardian in a statement. The nickel mine had previously operated under other Canadian ownership during the country’s 1960–96 civil war between the military and leftist guerrillas. An estimated 200,000 people were killed during the war, most of them Indigenous Maya civilians killed by the military. Corporate land and mining rights acquired under military rule sparked decades of conflict and opposition from local Indigenous communities. The Fenix mine is located on the country’s largest lake, in a predominantly Maya Q’eqchi’ region in eastern Guatemala. The mine has been linked to violence for decades, including extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances during the civil war, according to a United Nations back truth commission. The mine reopened amid violent clashes with local protestors in 2014, and it is now owned by the Solway Group, a Russian conglomerate. In 2019, Guatemala’s constitutional court upheld a petition to suspend operations at the mine pending consultation with affected Indigenous communities. “There are many brothers and sisters in this struggle,” said German Chub, who was shot and paralysed by mine security personnel on September 27, 2009, the same day Ich was killed. A former army lieutenant colonel, Padilla was also found guilty on three counts of culpable injury for his role in Chub’s shooting and assaults on two other Indigenous men from a nearby village.
Padilla spent four and a half years in prison prior to an initial 2017 acquittal, overturned in appeals. He pleaded guilty in December 2020 following a sentencing and reparations agreement between the prosecution and defense. He will not face further jail time. Padilla and his defense lawyers declined comment following the ruling Wednesday. The full sentence will be formally issued on 13 January. “For me it is a relief and at the same time it brings sadness,” Chub told the Guardian. “It took us so long to be heard.”"
2021-01-07T06:30:01Z,global-development,Global development,Making waves: the hit Indian island radio station leading climate conversations,"Selvarani Mari is a fisher and seaweed collector who lives on Pamban Island of Tamil Nadu, on the southernmost tip of India. Every day she helps her husband cast the fishing nets, maintains rafts for cultivating seaweed, and dives into the ocean to gather sargassum. But she always makes time to listen to the radio. Mari, 33, and her friends and family all unfailingly tune into Kadal Osai on 90.4FM, India’s first local radio station for a fishing community. With guests including from older people from the villages sharing their fishing wisdom or chatting about the climate crisis, the station has become an integral part of local life, featuring gossip, jokes, old songs and news on fish prices and sea conditions. Gayathri Usman, head of Kadal Osai, fell in love with the station when she visited the area, and stayed on to run it.
“While a majority of the 12-member crew is from the same community, I am the odd one out,” she says. “Our shows are popular because they are entertaining, useful, and, more importantly, in a local dialect of Tamil that the fishing community understands and finds comfort in,” she says. Started by businessman Armstrong Fernando, himself from a fishing family, Kadal Osai (“the sound of the ocean” in Tamil) began in August 2016 with just a few hours of transmission daily, before going full-time in 2019. Alongside updates on weather, marine affairs and fish prices, advice on safe and sustainable fishing and the preservation of coral reefs, the station also conducts on and off-air workshops on the climate crisis and biodiversity. On the fringes of India’s mainland, across the water from Sri Lanka, Pamban and the surrounding 20 islands and coral reefs are part of the richly biodiverse Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve, and home to 47 hamlets of the indigenous Marakeyars, engaged in fishing for centuries.
“Due to poor signal reception, the fishing community cannot solely depend on the All India Radio [India’s national broadcaster], especially while at sea. In such a scenario, it is Kadal Osai – with a coverage area of 5-10km – that they tune into,” says Usman. In the past few years, the climate crisis has had a drastic effect on marine life and local livelihoods. Senthil Rajan is a microbiologist at a seaweed cultivation site in Pamban.
“It has become increasingly difficult to predict and interpret water levels in the ocean, cyclone formations, and potential fishing zones. The erratic weather patterns have led to an unprecedented rise in sea levels as well as the height of the waves, thus affecting many seaweed cultivating sites,” says Rajan. “In such a scenario, tapping into the traditional knowledge of the fishing community, remains a rich source of learning.” Understanding this need to share knowledge with the next generation, Kadal Osai invites experienced fishers to talk with experts about the effects of over-exploitation on marine resources, and the importance of integrating traditional and modern fishing methods.
“Using umbrella terms such as climate change and global warming with this coastal community may not drive home the point effectively. So, we juxtapose the knowledge passed down the generations with the right mix of anecdotes and scientific techniques and keep the dialogue going on climate change,” says Usman.
Radio is one of the most powerful methods of communication in India, with enormous reach among its 1.38bn population. Even prime minister Narendra Modi has a monthly programme. Unicef collaborated with 215 community radio stations in India, such as Kadal Osai, to create awareness around ending child marriage, something which has been on the decline in India, by 2030. “We started the ‘Kutty Chutty Express’ to inform children on the ill-effects of child marriages through skits, quizzes and roadshows, as well as conducting workshops,” says Usman. The station also publicises the number for Childline India Foundation, which operates the country’s first 24-hour hotline for children in distress.
During the pandemic, Kadal Osai has become a bridge between the authorities and the coastal communities. It created awareness of the importance of sanitising and social distancing, and also distributed free masks. “In the initial months, we tried to break a myth among islanders – who believed that they were safe from Covid-19, being surrounded by the salty sea water. Now, since the lockdown has been relaxed, we highlight that ostracising affected people isn’t the solution,” says Usman, as she signs off to go live on 90.4FM, and continue her mission to entertain and inform her faithful community of listeners.

2021-01-06T07:15:21Z,global-development,Global development,Congolese people have been brutalised since 1996. Why isnâ€™t the west helping?,"On New Year’s Eve, a gang of militia left its jungle base and swept across Beni, a forested north-eastern corner of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, looking for Nande people to kill. Locals alerted the Congolese army but they were ignored. In small farms in Tingwe, a few kilometres from a DRC army base, the gang found 25 people – men, women and children – out harvesting food. One by one they hacked them to death with machetes and axes. Rarely over the past six years has a month passed that I have not received gruesome images of people killed in Beni. Almost 300 people were killed – most of them women and children – in just three months in November 2019–January 2020. Forty were killed in May. In July, the UN said that 793 civilians have been killed, 176 wounded and 717 others abducted in attacks in the preceding 18 months, which UN investigators said may amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes. Dozens more were killed in September, October and November.
Massacres on this scale usually prompt a strong response from the US, EU and UK, as they should. UN peacekeepers are sent to the region; communiques are issued; the government opens an investigation. In DRC’s case, none of this has happened. Since 1996, we Congolese have been killed in a multitude of ways: by our former president, Joseph Kabila, and his generals. By the use of rape as a weapon of war to punish, displace, destroy and humiliate Congolese women and their families and communities (an estimated 1,200 women are raped every day and this has been going on since 1996). By Rwandan and Ugandan armies. By famine and disease. Now we are being killed by mortars and machetes. The first massacre in Beni happened in 2014; exactly a year after Congolese and UN forces defeated the M23 – a militia gang in DRC allegedly supported by Rwandan president Paul Kagame. We have now entered the seventh year of these massacres. Yet an indifferent international community has allowed the killings to go on, claiming more and more lives each week. How many more must die before action is taken? The government in Kinshasa blames the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebel group for the deaths; a theory believed by few Congolese. Besides, a UN security council report has accused General Muhindo Akili Mundos of financing and supplying militia to do the killings. Another report found the recruits were allegedly promised up to $250 for each kill. Instead of facing justice, our new president, Félix Tshisekedi, has instead promoted Mundos to the rank of deputy army inspector, leaving Beni’s Nande population to their fate. They are now on the brink of being wiped out because of their land. The US and EU have denounced the violence – their ambassadors in Kinshasa often tweet their revulsion and sympathy – but that’s it; giving the world the false impression that something is being done to stop the killings, as if they are shielding someone from justice. This might be why the US has been blocking the creation of an international criminal tribunal for DRC to end the impunity fuelling the violence in Beni and elsewhere in the country, while six million more Congolese people are now in displacement camps, unable to return to their homes because of violence and starvation. When I heard about the latest massacre I wrote to Joe Biden, pleading with him to send in UN lawyers. Peacekeepers are clearly failing – a UN report has already documented more than 600 war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. Yet not a single one of those the UN named has been brought to justice. However, I cannot shake the feeling that nothing will change, that the Congolese people have been abandoned. The death and destruction we have suffered – the more than 5.4 million killed between 1998 and 2008 – half of whom were children under 5, the wholesale wasting of villages, towns and communities, the relentless use of rape and machetes and axes in Beni and elsewhere in DRC seem not to matter. But this is not a humanitarian appeal: it is a call for solidarity and compassion. I believe what is happening in Beni in eastern DRC is genocidal – and the UK, US and EU stance on the impunity fuelling these killings is shameful. Even complicit. • Vava Tampa is a community organiser, a freelance writer focusing on Africa’s great lakes, decolonisation and culture, and a social worker in London"
2021-01-06T06:27:19Z,global-development,Global development,Virginity tests for female rape survivors outlawed by Pakistani court,"A Pakistani court has outlawed the practice of subjecting female rape survivors to a virginity test in an unprecedented ruling. Lahore’s high court ruled on Monday that the virginity test has no legal basis and “offends the personal dignity of the female victim”. Making the judgment, Justice Ayesha Malik said: “Virginity testing is highly invasive, having no scientific or medical requirement, yet carried out in the name of medical protocols in sexual violence cases. “It is a humiliating practice, which is used to cast suspicion on the victim, as opposed to focusing on the accused and the incident of sexual violence.” In a 2018 report, the UN said that virginity tests, a medically dubious internal examination of a woman’s hymen, still take place in 20 countries, and can be conducted with or without consent in rape cases or when a woman is accused of a “moral” crime such as premarital sex or running away. Premarital sex remains a crime in Pakistan for men and women and carries a five-year prison sentence.
“The verdict is the culmination of a history of activism and built on the hard work that the feminist movement has been engaging in for decades. The test is part of a larger structure of patriarchy that hinges victimhood on women’s characters and perpetuates the myth of the ‘perfect victim’,” Nighat Dad, a lawyer and rights activist told the Guardian. “The barriers in place for women to report cases of rape are insurmountable, but this historic verdict will go a long way in dismantling those barriers,” she said. In October Human Rights Watch said virginity examinations had long been a routine part of criminal proceedings in Pakistan, based on a misogynistic assumption that a woman “habituated to sexual intercourse” is less likely to have been raped. Police and prosecutors have used the results to accuse rape victims of illegal sexual intercourse and to treat them as criminals. Pakistan’s minister for human rights, Shireen Mazari, lauded the judgment, which will apply only in the state of Punjab, on Twitter."
2021-01-05T07:15:51Z,global-development,Global development,Zimbabwe enters Covid lockdown amid fears over crowded new year parties,"Parties and new year celebrations that attracted thousands of revellers with little social distancing or mask wearing have triggered panic and a strict 30-day national lockdown in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. On New Year’s Eve thousands of people gathered at Matapi, Mbare, one of Zimbabwe’s oldest townships for a dancehall concert, while thousands of others held parties across the city despite a police ban. Video footage and photographs showing huge crowds partying with no regard to Covid-19 regulations prompted an outcry on social media, with Zimbabweans questioning why the police had failed to shut down the concert. The Mbare event, which attracted top artists, was held less than a kilometre from Matapi police station. Police have since arrested people involved in organising the unsanctioned concert, for breaking lockdown rules that ban gatherings of more than 50 people. “So far, 52 people have been arrested … for openly defying the government’s Covid-19 measures on health, safety and security,” police said in a statement. On the same night, other late-night venues dotted about the city were also crowded with revellers. Across the country, 2,321 people were arrested on New Year’s Day for breaking lockdown measures, including 200 teenagers at a house party in Westgate, Harare. “It appears members of the public are taking the Covid-19 pandemic for granted and are no longer taking precautionary measures,” the police said. The events flouting regulations have triggered panic, with Zimbabweans fearing another wave of the virus.
On Sunday Zimbabwe recorded 774 Covid cases, with 571 new infections in Harare. As of 3 January, Zimbabwe had recorded 15,265 cases and 380 deaths. However, testing is not widespread and cases have been rising rapidly since Christmas as Zimbabweans who work in South Africa returned home for the holidays. Health experts have warned of a rapid rise in new infections, especially in the most populous suburbs where social distancing is impossible, while a government official said Zimbabwe could be “overrun by the virus”. “We hear UK beds are overwhelmed by Covid-19. Well, that’s them. They say in South Africa that hospital admission thresholds are now quite high – that’s them. But, let me tell you about our own situation: don’t catch the virus if you can avoid it. We are being overwhelmed and overrun by this virus,” the information secretary, Nick Mangwana, said in a tweet. Zimbabweans with relatives suffering from Covid-19 have pleaded for ventilators as private hospitals continue to charge high rates. With a fragile health system, where there has been insufficient testing and a lack of preparedness to deal with the virus, health experts have warned of an impending health catastrophe. In response to the rising cases, the government on Saturday ordered a strict 30-day national lockdown. The vice-president, Constantino Chiwenga, said Zimbabwe had recorded 1,342 cases and 29 deaths in the past week, “the highest number recorded so far”. He ordered that funerals be limited to 30 people while gatherings such as weddings and church services have been banned for 30 days. The reopening of schools has been postponed indefinitely, while restaurants and bars have been shut down. A 6pm-6am curfew has been introduced. However, airports will remain open, while intercity travel has been banned withborders open only to commercial cargo and vehicles transiting to other countries. The lockdown also bans any form of informal trading, which is the mainstay of the economy and how millions of people earn get their livelihood.
Zimbabweans who spoke to the Guardian in Harare said the strict rules would plunge families into hunger. “I used up all my money when I travelled for the Christmas holidays, how do I survive for the next 30 days without selling my wares? These decisions are being made with little regard to how poor people like us are going to survive,” said Esther Marimbire, a vendor from Budiriro, a suburb of southwest Harare. The 40-year-old said that despite the government’s promises to give struggling families relief during the first lockdown in March last year, her family is yet to benefit. “I was part of the thousands here who registered for relief last year but up to now nothing has come our way. This means the government does not care about our welfare,” she said. Zimbabwe has nearly 8 million people in need of food aid, according to humanitarian organisations, but recent rains have triggered hope of a better harvest following successive years of drought. Glen Mutasa, 30, of Glen View in Harare, said his small business would suffer under the lockdown. “From the experience of last year’s lockdown that went on for months, hunger is knocking on my door. I cannot risk running battles with the police and soldiers so I will stay at home, but it’s tough.”"
2021-01-04T10:46:54Z,global-development,Global development,New-sprung: the project turning PPE offcuts into Covid patient mattresses,"At the height of the pandemic in the Indian state of Kerala, fashion designer Lakshmi Menon, 46, heard that every new Covid care centre had to have 50 beds. Mattresses were in short supply. Every time a patient was discharged, the mattress had to be incinerated. “I thought: that’s a lot of mattresses and a lot of burning,” says Menon. Menon’s solution was to collect the mountains of plastic pieces from factories that make PPE – all the little bits left over after cutting. Women then braid the bits into rope-like plaits 6ft long. The braids are laid out in a zigzag and the ends tied together. The result is a light, soft, washable, hygienic mattress for just 300 rupees (£3) – half the price of a normal one. The women of Arayankav near Kochi, where Menon lives on a rubber plantation, get jobs, the environment is protected and Covid clinics get mattresses – “shayya” in Sanskrit.
The idea of using waste scraps came to her when she was driving to Kochi in February and saw children sleeping on the road. A few days later, she visited a friend who runs a fashion house and saw heaps of waste fabric of different sizes. “That’s when I thought I could use braiding to make mattresses for the homeless. Braiding allows you to use every single bit of fabric of different sizes. Even the tiniest bit can be incorporated and everyone knows how to tie a plait,” she says. In March, she made 20 mattresses and handed them out to homeless families. Then lockdown happened. Her friends in design and fashion lost business overnight. Workers were laid off and things looked grim. Menon forgot about the fabric mattresses, until she went to a friend’s tailoring unit in July and saw that he had started making PPE. In the corner lay a mountain of plastic pieces. Menon’s eyes gleamed. “I picked them up and found they were cleaner, softer and more dust-free than fabric scraps. It was the best material I could have wished for,” she says.
Her friend was delighted when Menon took the scrap pieces. He had been struggling with how to dispose of them because burning was out of the question. At the same time Kerala, overwhelmed by the pandemic, ordered the setting up of 50-bed Covid centres across the state and village councils scrambled to find enough mattresses. Apart from the Covid centres that have bought them, Menon is working with NGOs to provide shayyas to homeless shelters and rough sleepers on the principle that “everyone deserves a good night’s sleep”. India’s 1.7 million homeless people normally sleep on the ground, usually on a thin mat. Students in India who are part of Enactus, the international not-for-profit organisation set up by accountancy firm KPMG, are working on making the mattress widely available. “We also feel that yoga centres might be interested in buying them as they are soft and light and easily rolled up,” says Ishartek Pabla, operations head of Enactus at Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies.
Menon is unlikely to meet a shortage of raw material. India has become the world’s second-largest PPE manufacturer, with more than 1,000 manufacturers producing 4.5m pieces a day, the country’s textile ministry announced this week. Menon’s shayya has been taken up by UN staff who will include it in a list of Covid innovative ideas that can be easily replicated. Several Indian corporations have also contacted her. “These big companies have to fulfil their corporate social responsibility objectives and the mattress provides a good way of proving income for rural women in a sustainable way with no need for any equipment. Nothing really. Just a bit of space,” says Menon.

A picture essay","It has been over a decade since Umar Tashbekov saw his opportunity. His village, Sary-Mogol in Kyrgyzstan, at an altitude of 3,600 metres, is close to Lenin’s Peak, a popular mountain destination for tourists. If they were already hiking there, why not attract them to visit his village too? Sary-Mogol is a three-hour drive from the nearest city of Osh, in the country’s south-east. Life here is not easy – short summers and unfavourable growing conditions make it hard to grow much more than potatoes and barley. The main source of work is the large livestock market in town. Others find employment as teachers or in the nearby coal mine. Out of its 5,200-strong population, about 500 people have left for Russia where companies welcome factory workers.
Clockwise from top left: A view of Lenin’s Peak and Sary Mogol village in south-east Kyrgyzstan; a girl carries bottles to fetch water in the village; clothes and other goods are sold at a weekly market, while men trade livestock An upside to traditional village life, with grandparents, parents and children all living together in the same small houses, has been the slow spread of Covid-19. Because homes are already crowded, people mostly meet up out in the street. That, and the overall government lockdowns, helped keep infection numbers low.
Lake Tulpar-Kul, in the Chon-Alay mountains But if there has been limited impact on health, the impact on livelihoods is deep. In 2019, more than 1,300 tourists passed through Sary-Mogol. This year, it was fewer than a dozen. In the last decade, tourism has grown so that almost everyone here is connected to the industry in some way. Receipts from the export of tourism and travel services, which represented almost 6% of GDP in 2018, have been forecast to almost disappear in 2020. Revenues are predicted to fall by as much as 90%.
Left: a sign indicates the yurt camp near Tulpar-Kel lake. Right: yaks roam in a field near the village Tashbekov opened the village’s first guesthouse in 2007, and invited other villagers to work with him. His company, CBT, soon became an “incubator” for the industry – almost everyone working in tourism has at some point passed through its doors. Soon after, he also opened the area’s first yurt camp, where tourists can stay in 12 traditional Kyrgyz lodgings out in the mountain valley. They enjoy the unique feel of the village – the old Soviet Uaz cars, the ancient ulak tartysh horse game, the markets selling traditional crafts.
The traditional sport of ulak-tartysh in the village of Taldy-Suu, near Sary-Mogol Then, Tashbekov’s son, Abdilla, took over the business. The 31-year-old has been a guide for more than 10 years. He built his own guesthouse, and was in the process of building a new one. He is always reading and researching on the internet, earning his reputation as the “studious” one. His vision has led to new ideas to develop the town and the family business. He and his father opened a bigger office, which serves as a gathering place for guides, workers and tourists. He organised ski training with other guides to move into winter tourism. In 2015, he had the idea to start the village’s horse and yak games festival and fair. The entire village attends, either as participants or spectators. Ticket sales bring in revenue for villagers working at the festival – cooking and selling traditional foods, performing traditional music and dancing shows, managing the yurt camp and competing in the games.
Abdilla and his family have lunch at home in Sary-Mogol. Abdilla has been a tour guide for more than 10 years. He built his own guesthouse for visitors and initiated the village’s horse and yak games festival and fair. All of that momentum has been lost in the wake of the pandemic. Abdilla and his family have felt the economic pain. “The tourist season is dead,” he says. “We had to close the office, yurt camp and guest houses this year.” His wife works as a music teacher, and they are living off her income, with two children to support. “If tourism does not improve, I will have to go to Osh or some other place to look for work in construction,” he says. That might bring its own set of challenges: the construction sector may soon be another difficult area in which to find jobs. The UN development programme (UNDP), which this year has launched a set of measures to strengthen adventure tourism in Kyrgyzstan, published a survey that found the most-affected sectors of the economy in Kyrgyzstan will be trade and consumer services and construction, each of which can expect 20% contraction.

He took over the business from his father in 2012 but coronavirus has stopped the flow of visitors Tashbekov’s other son, Ali, 23, began working in the family business at 13, before going to Osh to study logistics and welding. His training has come in handy during the pandemic. When the flow of visitors to the village stopped, he was able to find work as a mechanic in the mine. But he loved working with tourists, meeting people from all over the world. “It was a good time,” he says. “Sometimes I didn’t have time to come home. After [guiding] one tour, I immediately went with other tourists back to the mountains.”
Ali Tashbekov has been working as a welder at the coalmine during the pandemic instead of in his usual role as a mountain guide. His wife Aizirek Avazova, pictured bottom, has had to stop working in the family’s guesthouse It was also a healthier job, he says, being outside in nature all day. Now he worries about the effects of the quarry gas he breathes in regularly. But as his wife worked in the now closed guesthouse kitchen, this is the only income they have. With his father recovering from a broken leg, a mother with Parkinson’s disease requiring expensive treatments, a one-year-old child and another on the way, the family’s resources are stretched to the limit.
They are not the only ones feeling the strain in their village. Midinov Almazbek studied languages on his father’s advice, which allows him to teach English at the local school. During the summer, Almazbek also works as a guide. He took out a bank loan a few years ago to build a guesthouse, which he successfully opened, but in February he took out another loan to expand his business. He expected a normal summer, but with no tourists coming, he is now struggling to pay it back.
Midinov Almazbek and his brother enclose their veranda with wooden planks in Sary-Mogol. Midinov is struggling to repay a loan he took out to build a guesthouse a few years ago “It’s been a hard year,” he says. “There’s not enough work, and not enough money.” Buunisa Termechikova, 58, also expected a normal summer. The entrepreneur opened a guesthouse and is skilled at crafts, especially the traditional Kyrgyz woman’s hat. Her new Ethnographic Museum, built by her son in July, is full of local products and historical artifacts. In the absence of foreign visitors, she is using the space for workshops for fellow villagers.
Buunisa Termechikova opened the Ethnographic Museum in Sary-Molog in July. Since visitors dried up during the pandemic, she has been offering workshops in traditional crafts, such as making doll’s hair, to people living in the area But villagers here still play volleyball in the gym, and take part in horse games, held to celebrate events such as the completion of a new house or the birth of a baby. Maybe it is this energy and spirit that makes the village attractive to those who visit. Two years ago, a Korean engineer had such a good horse-riding holiday that he funded an initiative upgrading the water infrastructure so that villagers no longer had to carry water from the river. Everyone in Sary-Mogol looks forward to sharing their energy and spirit with visitors again.

2021-01-01T08:30:04Z,global-development,Global development,Essex lorry tragedy must spur greater effort to stop trafficking from Vietnam,"Trials in the UK of the drivers and haulage organisers involved in the Essex lorry tragedy in which 39 Vietnamese migrants perished ended in guilty pleas and convictions. Vietnam also convicted the agents who brokered the victims’ journeys to the UK and sentenced them to terms of imprisonment. While these are positive developments in achieving some measure of justice for the victims, they won’t do anything to stem the smuggling and trafficking of Vietnamese migrants to the UK. No justice system has reached the actual masterminds and profiteers behind this horrific crime: the organised crime groups. It’s been a year since Essex, and the Covid pandemic has made the world a very different place. International air travel has been disrupted and won’t return to normal for the foreseeable future. Vietnam is one of the world’s few bright spots: it quickly eliminated the spread of the virus and has recorded just over 1,400 cases and 35 deaths. Consequently, its economic outlook is rosy. Manufacturing is booming, with multinational companies diversifying their supply chain into Vietnam, which means thousands of new jobs. Yet young Vietnamese are still trying to go to the UK and Europe. Recruiters post daily messages on social media that advertise blue-collar jobs in countries such as Poland, Romania, Hungary, Finland and Slovakia, promising a life of relative prosperity. Scores of Vietnamese reply, eager to be the first ones to depart as soon as international borders reopen. If the risk of anonymous death in the back of a lorry, Covid-19 and criminal convictions can’t stop the smuggling and trafficking of Vietnamese people to the UK, what can?
First, we need to address the root causes of why people embark on this dangerous journey in the first place. Driven by a desire for economic and social opportunities they believe are unattainable in their home provinces in central Vietnam, people are willing to pay £30,000 or more to smugglers for a “safe route” to the UK. Awareness-raising campaigns are not enough to dispel the myth of a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. The campaigns need to be accompanied by programmes that provide opportunities for a better life in Vietnam, such as vocational training and job placements. At the same time, trafficking can no longer be considered solely a UK or Vietnam problem. The trade is incredibly lucrative, and includes wildlife, drugs and counterfeit goods, and is led by ethnic Vietnamese organised crime groups based in countries with large diaspora communities such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany and France. It’s no coincidence that smuggling routes commonly run through these countries, and Vietnamese migrants often become victims of exploitation while on their way to the UK. The perpetrators may be of Vietnamese origin, but they are EU citizens committing crimes on EU soil. One of the biggest shortcomings with the UK and EU responses to Vietnamese trafficking and organised crime is the lack of experience and resources to work with victims and diaspora communities. One good first step in 2020 was the secondment of Vietnamese officers to Police Scotland, bringing much-needed linguistic and cultural expertise. This cross-border cooperation needs to be broadened to include EU transit countries and a long-term strategy and dedicated budget to tackle Vietnamese trafficking and smuggling at the highest criminal levels. The sad truth is that the Vietnamese migrants in the lorry were only considered victims because they died, tragically and very publicly. Otherwise, they would have been considered illegal migrants with no regard as to how they were exploited or victimised before reaching Essex. Going forward, we must recognise victims no matter where they are in their journey and change our solutions and responses to match the transnational and constantly evolving business of human trafficking and smuggling. Criminal networks are depending on the chaos of Covid, Brexit and economic recession to shift attention away from them, but governments, NGOs, the private sector and law enforcement must remain focused and coordinated. There is always another Essex tragedy waiting in the wings. • Mimi Vu is a partner at Raise Partners and a Vietnam-based anti-trafficking and modern slavery expert.

2021-01-01T07:45:03Z,global-development,Global development,Pakistan's #MeToo movement hangs in the balance over celebrity case,"It takes a lot to rattle Leena Ghani. As an artist turned activist helping to raise the voices of Pakistan’s women, she has often fielded abuse, threats and harassment. But when she learned, on a morning in late September, that police had charged her for criminal defamation, linked to Pakistan’s most high-profile #MeToo case, Ghani says she was shaken. “In terms of silencing and demonising people speaking out against sexual assault, it was a new low even for Pakistan,” she says. Ghani was not alone. Eight others were also named in the case, facing three years in jail for criminal defamation. Some only learned of their involvement through a newspaper article. Lawyers say the case has exposed how cyber defamation laws passed under the guise of protecting women from online harassment are being used instead to silence Pakistan’s victims of sexual assault. On 16 December, the authorities said there was enough evidence to take Ghani and others to trial – and the future of Pakistan’s #MeToo movement now hangs in the balance.
That movement began in April 2018 after Meesha Shafi, a singer and actor who starred in The Reluctant Fundamentalist, sent out a tweet alleging sexual harassment. Shafi alleged that she had “been subjected, on more than one occasion, to sexual harassment of a physical nature” at the hands of one of Pakistan’s most beloved celebrities, Ali Zafar. Shafi wrote that by speaking out, she hoped to “break the culture of silence that permeates through our society”. Zafar denies “any and all claims of harassment lodged against me by Ms Shafi”, and so far has successfully defeated the sexual harassment claims she brought against him in court. The allegations reverberated through Pakistan’s deeply conservative Islamic society, where women speaking out against assault is rare and taboo. Because of Zafar’s popularity disbelief was rife, but dozens of women and men came out in support of Shafi on social media, including several who alleged assault by Zafar.
Among them was Ghani, who said her concerns about Zafar’s treatment of women emerged after they became friends in 2014. Writing on Twitter, Ghani accused Zafar of behaviour towards her that “displays a clear lack of respect for women”, including “inappropriate contact, groping, sexual comments”. “You hide from him,” read Ghani’s post, “hoping his sleazy eyes and hands don’t find you again. His hands don’t make their way up and down your waist or hold you too tight while you desperately try to wriggle and run.”
Similar accusations followed. Blogger Humna Raza alleged that Zafar had groped her at an event, while Maham Javaid, a journalist, recounted on Twitter an alleged incident where Zafar had “tried to kiss my cousin and pull my cousin into a restroom with him. Luckily, my cousin’s friends were there to push him off.” Zafar has accused Shafi of organising a social media campaign against him. According to newspaper reports, he said he could not believe that “anyone can come forward and accuse someone who is innocent and decent, has worked hard for over two decades – solely on social media”. Zafar filed a civil defamation lawsuit against Shafi, seeking a billion rupees in damages. The court accepted the lawsuit and placed a gag order on Shafi, which still prevents her from discussing the allegations in public. Over the next two and a half years, Zafar appeared on a dozen television shows to defend his name, sometimes breaking down into tears and occasionally accompanied by his wife. He alleged the accusations were a smear campaign, coordinated by a group of women who created fake accounts and were funded by foreign money. Last month, Pakistan’s president awarded Zafar the Pride of Pakistan, one of the country’s highest honours. In July 2018, Shafi also began legal proceedings, attempting to take Zafar to court for sexual harassment in the workplace. Her case was dismissed on the technicality that freelancers were not covered by the law. An appeal to the Lahore high court was unsuccessful and although her lawyers have challenged the ruling in the supreme court, the case has still not been heard.
In November 2018 rumours began to swirl that Zafar had also filed criminal charges against Shafi and 25 of her online supporters and fellow accusers with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), Pakistan’s most powerful investigating body. By July 2019, dozens of people, mainly women, who had written social media posts either making allegations about Zafar or expressing support for Shafi, began to receive notices to appear before the FIA for questioning. Ghani, Javaid and Raza were among them, as well as Iffat Omar, an actor who knew Shafi and Zafar personally. When Zafar claimed on television that the women taking Shafi’s side were being paid by the west to spread propaganda, Omar wrote “stop lying harasser” on her social media. Omar and Ghani were questioned by the FIA and both separately alleged they had been put under pressure by officers to retract their allegations against Zafar and apologise. Both refused. The senior FIA officer on the case was later suspended over a tweet which led to accusations he was being “Ali Zafar’s personal spokesperson” on social media. The FIA declined to comment on the case.
At least three of the women also allege that Zafar applied “indirect harassment” through social networks. Omar says she received a “clear message from Ali Zafar that if I just apologise, everything will be better for me – and I have given him the direct answer that it is not happening.” Ghani alleges that “Zafar also tried to get to me through my family and would send cruel messages about my family’s problems through third parties. A lot of dirty tactics. He was trying to put pressure on me to apologise and I’ll admit it was scary.” But in late 2019, after she had filed a legal petition against Zafar and the FIA for harassment and Javaid had written to the senate human rights committee to complain, everything went quiet. Until September 2020, when news of the charges broke. Nine people, five women including Shafi, Ghani, Omar, Javaid and Raza, and four men, had been booked for defamation by the FIA’s cybercrime wing over the alleged social media “character assassination” of Zafar. The charges carried a three-year jail sentence. There was confusion as to why only nine had been booked in the case, when the original list had 25 names. But then, says Javaid, the penny dropped: “We realised we were the only ones who had refused to apologise to Zafar.” One of the accused, journalist Haseem uz Zaman, is facing charges for tweets that claimed “Ali Zafar harasses women”. They refuse to apologise. “That would not only harm my future and my journalistic credibility, but it would also harm every other survivor of sexual harassment who comes forward in the future,” they say. “And I could not live with that.” After news of the criminal charges broke, Ghani and the others began to face a barrage of online rape and death threats and harassment, and say they were vilified in Pakistani media. A week later, the blogger Raza created a new Twitter account and published a handwritten note retracting her allegations against Zafar and apologising for “the hurt” she had caused him and his family. Zafar shared the tweet. Raza’s name has been dropped from the case. For the women, most galling of all was the law they had been charged under. The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act was passed in 2016 partly to protect women from online harassment, but the wing of the FIA tasked with prosecuting these cases is accused of being ineffective. Nighat Dad, Shafi’s lawyer, says she knows dozens of women who have complained to the FIA about online abuse, hate-speech, rape threats and vindictive sharing of intimate videos, but had received no response. “It’s rare the cybercrime wing will register cases lodged by women activists, and even if they do, it usually takes years for anything to happen,” says Dad. “So I was never expecting that they would be so shameless as to take action against women survivors who are speaking up.” This was not an isolated use of the law against women. When girls at the prestigious Lahore Grammar School recently alleged harassment by teachers and fellow students, several were threatened with criminal defamation, after which the accusations went quiet. At Lahore University of Management Sciences, a Facebook page for student testimonials of sexual assault was shut down with a letter threatening to report them to the FIA. “We are seeing this happen over and over,” says Dad. “The cyber laws that were enacted in the name of protecting women in Pakistan now are being misused and weaponised to silence them.”
As Shafi’s lawyer, Dad claims she herself has been subjected to a “vicious smear campaign”, with newspapers making allegations that she is a foreign operative running an “illegal NGO”, unsubstantiated claims retweeted by Zafar. “They will not only try and silence victims, but anyone who tries to help victims fight for justice,” says Dad. On 15 December, the FIA presented evidence that Shafi and others in the case were “guilty” of defamation and asked for court proceedings against them to begin. Ambreen Qureshi, Zafar’s lawyer, declined to talk to the Guardian about the allegations but said “we have presented evidence to the FIA on account of which Ms Shafi and eight others are booked”. Qureshi says Shafi had failed to provide any witnesses to support her allegations. Shafi’s lawyers say she was not given the opportunity. According to Qureshi, the court documents so far show “in this case an innocent man was made a target of a criminally motivated malicious campaign by a group of closely related women.” The eight women facing charges deny any previous relationship or any campaign and say they intend to fight the case in court and push for the cyber defamation law to be repealed. Ghani says: “People keep saying #MeToo is dying in Pakistan, which is so terrible because it’s not like women are not getting harassed and assaulted and raped, but we are being silenced. We all realise that Pakistan’s #MeToo movement hinges on this case.” “The whole system is against us; Ali Zafar is a powerful man, and going to court is hard – but what can be harder than lying and living with that lie,” she adds. “I would rather go to jail.” Sign up for the Global Dispatch newsletter – a fortnightly roundup of our top stories, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues:"
2021-01-01T07:15:03Z,global-development,Global development,Tributes paid to Ethiopian refugee farmer who championed integration in Italy,"Tributes have been paid to a 42-year-old Ethiopian refugee and farmer who became a symbol of integration in Italy, her adopted home. Agitu Ideo Gudeta was attacked and killed, allegedly by a former employee, on her farm in Trentino on Wednesday. Gudeta had left Addis Ababa in 2010 after angering the authorities by taking part in protests against “land grabbing”. Once in Italy, she tenaciously followed and realised her ambition to move to the mountains and start her own farm. Taking advantage of permits that give farmers access to abandoned public land in depopulated areas, she reclaimed 11 hectares (27 acres) around an old barn in the Mòcheni valley, where she founded her La Capra Felice (The Happy Goat) enterprise. Gudeta started with a herd of 15 goats, quickly rising to 180 in a few years, producing organic milk and cheese using environmentally friendly methods and hiring migrants and refugees. “I created my space and made myself known, there was no resistance to me,” she told Reuters news agency that year. “Agitu brought to Italy the dream she was unable to realise in Ethiopia, in part because of land grabbing,” Gabriella Ghermandi, singer, performer, novelist and friend of Gudeta, told the Guardian. “Her farm was successful because she applied what she had learned from her grandparents in the countryside.
“In Italy, many people have described her enterprise as a model of integration. But Agitu’s dream was to create an environmentally sustainable farm that was more than just a business; for her it also symbolised struggle against class divisions and the conviction that living in harmony with nature was possible. And above all she carried out her work with love. She had given a name to each one of her goats.” In a climate where hostility toward migrants was increasing, led by far-right political leaders, her success story was reported by numerous media outlets as an example of how integration can benefit communities. “The most rewarding satisfaction is when people tell me how much they love my cheeses because they’re good and taste different,” she said in an interview with Internazionale in 2017. “It compensates for all the hard work and the prejudices I’ve had to overcome as a woman and an immigrant.” Two years ago she received death threats and was the target of racist attacks, which she reported to police, recounting them on her social media posts. But police said a man who has confessed to the rape and murder of the farmer was an ex-employee who, they said, allegedly acted for “economic reasons”.
The UN refugee agency said it was “pained” by Gudeta’s death, and that her entrepreneurial spirit “demonstrated how refugees can contribute to the societies that host them”. “Despite her tragic end, the UNHCR hopes that Agitu Ideo Gudeta will be remembered and celebrated as a model of success and integration and inspire refugees that struggle to rebuild their lives,” the agency said. “We spoke on the phone last week’’, said Ghermandi. “We spent two hours speaking about Ethiopia. We had plans to get together in the spring. Agitu considered Italy her home. She used to say that she had suffered too much in Ethiopia. Now Agitu is gone, but her work mustn’t die. We will soon begin a fundraising campaign to follow her plan for expanding the business so that her dream will live on.” Gudeta would have turned 43 on New Year’s Day."
2021-01-01T06:30:02Z,global-development,Global development,Calls for release of man arrested photographing transfer of Rohingyas,"Bangladesh authorities are facing calls to release a Rohingya man arrested while photographing the transfer of refugees to a controversial island camp this week. Abul Kalam, 35, has been held since Monday morning when he was reportedly beaten before being taken to police barracks near the Kutupalong refugee camp, where he has lived since leaving Myanmar as a child refugee in the early 1990s. “Photography is not a crime. Abul Kalam was taking photos of buses on their way to Bhasan Char … it is by no means a secret and has been extensively covered in the media,” said a letter calling for his release.
The letter was signed by Bangladeshi and international rights activists and journalists, including Bianca Jagger, renowned Bangladesh photographer Shahidul Alam, who was detained for months after covering protests in 2018, prominent lawyer Sara Hossain and Prof Penny Green, founder of the International State Crime Initiative at Queen Mary University of London.
Bangladesh moved up to 1,000 people on Monday in its second batch of relocations from the Cox’s Bazar-based settlements, which make up the world’s largest refugee camp, to the isolated island in the Bay of Bengal. The relocations have been criticised because Bangladesh has not permitted an independent assessment of the island’s safety, despite concerns about its vulnerability to natural disasters. Two other Rohingya refugees said they had avoided taking pictures of the relocation because of threats and concerns for their safety. The UN’s refugee chief, Filippo Grandi, also raised concerns in December about whether the refugees were being relocated voluntarily, as Bangladesh claimed, after accusations of coercion.
A UNHCR spokesperson said: “UNHCR has been engaged with the authorities since the arrest of Abul Kalam on 28 December and is following the situation closely to ensure he receives a fair hearing of any charge against him. UNHCR has assigned one of its partner lawyers to represent him during the investigation and any subsequent legal proceedings.” Earlier this month Abul Kalam won two awards for his work in the Rohingya Photography Competition."
