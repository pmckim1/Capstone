2015-06-18T10:00:04Z,global-development,Global development,Colombia's pipes to nowhere: villagers die of thirst as corruption stalls dam project,"A surprise five-minute rain shower falls like a taunt over the scorched riverbed of the Ranchería river: fat raindrops spatter in the dust but evaporate almost immediately. Nearby, a young girl and boy scoop out a bowlful of cloudy groundwater from a makeshift well to wash a few scraps of clothes.
The Ranchería river has run dry after three years of intense drought, decades of overuse and a lifetime of public corruption in the province of La Guajira, one of Colombia’s poorest and most forgotten regions. Crops have long ago shrivelled, babies are dying of malnutrition and livestock are wasting away from thirst. It was for times like this that the El Cercado dam was built on the river, to mitigate the effects of cyclical droughts in the region, home to the Wayuu Indians. At the entrance to the El Cercado dam, a huge billboard pronounces “From here will flow the water that will be the future to the Guajira.” The original project foresaw the dam supplying water to the aqueducts of nine municipalities as well as providing irrigation for agriculture. But the massive pipes that should have made this possible lead nowhere. “They never connected it to anything,” said Octavio Calderón of the provincial potable water office. The reservoir currently stands at 40% of its capacity and local authorities are controlling the flow of the river past the dam to ensure the supply. But the flow hardly makes it past the rice fields, cattle ranches and the world’s largest open-pit coalmine that tap into the river below the dam. By the time it reaches the middle Guajira, where the population is mostly Wayuu, the Ranchería is barely even a trickle.
“There is a lot of demand on the river and very little control over how it’s used,” said Calderón. Javier Rojas, leader of an indigenous association called Wayuu Shipia, puts it more bluntly: “The Wayuu are dying of thirst and hunger because of the dam,” he said. According to official figures, 26 children died of malnutrition in La Guajira in 2013, 48 in 2014 and 11 in the first six months of 2015. But Rojas says the actual numbers are far higher. He says he has verified the death of at least 25 children since February, and calculates that at least 400 children have died in the past three years. “I get weekly reports of the death of at least three children,” he said. The latest such report came from a village known as Hirtú. On 6 June, a two-month-old child, Chepe Uriana, died after receiving treatment for malnutrition at hospital and being sent home with his mother to their village just seven kilometres from the town of Manaure. “A significant number of boys and girls, mostly Wayuu, have died in La Guajira from perfectly preventable causes,” the country’s human rights ombudsman’s office said in a 2014 report.
Thousands more are barely surviving. In the village of Nuevo Ambiente, a young girl dribbles a cup of water over the head of her brother, who sits in a plastic tub under the shade of a open-walled thatch-roof hut. David is three years old, but has not yet learned to walk or talk. Stunted by severe malnutrition, he weighs just 6.7kg and wears diapers normally worn by a five-month-old infant. It means he’s improving, according to his grandmother, Alcira Epieyú. Until a few months ago, he was wearing diapers for a newborn. Rosa is another survivor. For the past two weeks, she and her mother Aines have been at the Centre for Nutritional Recovery in the Guajira capital, Riohacha, run by the child welfare agency. She looks like an infant of about six months but Aines says she’s a year and four months old, her growth stunted by a lack of food and clean water in their village in the upper Guajira. Aines says doctors have told her the water they pull from a well is not safe to drink. “But what can we do if there’s no other water?” she asks as she cradles Rosa in her arms.
Wayuu leaders have now taken their case for water to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, requesting precautionary measures aiming to force the local and national government to ensure their access to water. “We asked for the commission to order the floodgates of the dam to be opened, and that the Wayuu should be given priority in the use of the water. Any surplus can then be used for economic activities,” says lawyer Carolina Sáchica, director of the legal clinic at the Tadeo Lozano University in Bogotá, who petitioned the commission on behalf of the Wayuu. One of the largest single users of the river water is the Cerrejón coalmine, jointly owned by BHP Billiton plc, Anglo American plc and Xstrata Coal. On average, the mine uses 2,700 cubic metres per day of water, drawing both surface flow from the river and groundwaterfrom wells, said company spokesman Carlos Franco, who added that the mine is using just 16% of the river water it is authorised to use. “The problem is not our use, the problem is they have not built the pipelines for the aqueducts,” said Franco. “The money for the aqueducts in La Guajira has been stolen over and over again.”
Alejandro Ordóñez, the inspector general, whose office investigates accusations of corruption and mismanagement by public servants, said on a visit to Guajira last year that the real problem in the department is corruption. “The main problem of the region is not the drought but corruption because royalties have been stolen for many years and the public works needed to face natural events that are foreseeable were not done,” Ordóñez said. On 1 June President Juan Manuel Santos travelled to the region to address the water issue. He made no mention of the El Cercado dam and the aqueducts it was supposed to feed, but he promised 100 new wells for the province by 2018. The Wayuu have heard those promises before. For now Lilia Uriana relies on dreams to find water. From atop the windswept hill where she and her family live in a collection of mud huts and thatched-roof stalls, she can see two jagueyes – traditional reservoirs dug by Wayuu communities to catch rainwater, when it comes. But the earth of the jagueyes surrounding her village of Taluorumana is cracked dry. It was her mother who dreamed last year of a certain spot where, if she left a necklace for the spirits, they would provide water. A 10-metre-deep well at the site has been serving as the family’s source for water ever since. The water at the bottom is brackish and slightly oily. “But it’s what we have,” said Uriana."
2015-06-18T07:30:00Z,global-development,Global development,Kenya's net gains on malaria prevention threatened by climate change | Murithi Mutiga,"Cradling her week-old son at a neonatal clinic in Nairobi’s sprawling Eastlands estate, where a steady throb from the stereos of battered public minibuses echoes through the streets, new mother Mary Onyango is a picture of concentration. She watches the nurse carefully explain how to use a mosquito net properly, and listens intently when the importance of covering sleeping children is explained. Over the past decade and a half, the level of infant mortality in Kenya has dropped at one of the fastest rates recorded anywhere in the world. The fall has attracted the attention of development scholars and researchers, andinspired gushing headlines in publications such as the Economist, which called the decline in child mortality rates in Africa “the best story in development”. In Kenya, child mortality fell by about 8% annually from 2005 on, with infant mortality declining from 52 deaths for every 1,000 live births in 2008/9 to 39 in 1,000 in 2014. The under-five mortality rate fell from 74 deaths for every 1,000 live births in 2008/9 to 52 deaths for every 1,000 live births in 2014. A World Bank study attributes the continued decline in infant mortality partly to an aggressive mosquito net distribution programme, which resulted in an increase in the use of treated bednets from 8% of all households in 2003 to 60% in 2008. Dr Francis Kimani, head of the malaria unit at the Kenya Medical Research Institute, says that while progress has been made the scale of the burden means the disease remains a long-term problem. “We can celebrate the fact that we have reversed the upward trend in malaria incidences but in terms of absolute numbers the burden is still high. The key challenge is in sustaining the downward trend and improving control measures such as expanding net use, taking care of pregnant mothers and doing away with anaemia in children which can help steer us eventually towards a future without malaria.” About three-quarters of Kenyans live in areas where they are exposed to malaria risk. The disease accounts for 30–50% of all outpatient attendance and a fifth of all admissions to health facilities. The economic toll of the disease is considerable, with researchers estimating 170 million working days are lost because of malaria each year. The UN’s millennium development goals set a 2015 deadline for reducing the global malaria burden by 75%, and reversing the global spread of the disease. But in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa, as well as good news, there is a worrying new challenge: climate change. Rising temperatures have opened the door to the spread of mosquitoes to areas in which they were barely a threat two decades ago. Mosquitoes are notoriously adaptable creatures, constantly developing resistance to insecticides, while the malaria parasite evolves to resist drugs.
Dr Andrew Githeko, one of the leading malaria researchers in Kenya, says the spread of mosquitoes to the traditionally cooler highlands, where previously there were low levels of malaria, was a major problem. “We started noticing this phenomenon in the late 80s and early 90s, with hikes of unusually warm and wet weather in many parts of the country consistent with global warming. The phenomenon peaked with the El Nino rains seen in the early 1990s, and then we witnessed sudden epidemics of highland malaria, which is a particularly severe form considering that the people in those areas will not have developed natural immunity.” Githeko says Africa needs to take steps to deal with this fresh challenge and continue to roll back malaria. Such measures include improving house construction methods by, for example, using screens to stop mosquitoes and building a good distance from marshlands. These techniques have been successfully deployed in countries ranging from Italy to the US. Enhanced research to tackle resistance to insecticides and treatment is also key, he says, although he points out trends are broadly positive. “We can’t be disheartened. When I started research work in 1986, I was astonished to find eight in 10 children had malaria and were consequently anaemic. We used to lose a lot of mothers. The real effort started in 2000 with the distribution of bednets, and things are completely different now. You can just see the children are so much happier and buoyant in the schools now than used to be the case in the past.” Another challenge for Kenya is the lack of general knowledge about how to tackle malaria and over-dependence on donors for health sector funding. Spreading information to young mothers like Onyango remains key to reducing transmission levels, because they are at the frontline in tackling the deadly parasite. “We can spend too much time distributing nets but we need to ensure they are actually used at rates of 80% and above,” says Dr Waqo Ejersa, head of the malaria control unit at Kenya’s ministry of health. “Investing in behavioural change communication, including interpersonal communication is really important because prevention is essential.”"
2015-06-18T07:00:10Z,global-development,Global development,Millennium development goal 6: 15 achievements on HIV and malaria,"1) Between 2000 and 2012, deaths from malaria fell by 42%. Health workers attribute much of this progress to the expansion of malaria interventions, including diagnostics and treatment at the community level and greater use of insecticide-treated bednets and indoor residual sprays. 2) The UN estimates 3.3m deaths from malaria were averted between 2000 and 2010. About 90% of these were children under the age of five in sub-Saharan Africa. 3) Uptake on insecticide-treated nets has been high in some countries. In Benin, Madagascar, Rwanda and Tanzania, more than 70% of children under five slept under nets in 2012. But this practice is not as widespread in other countries, including in Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria where about 20% of children under five slept under nets. 4) Greater access to tuberculosis treatment saved approximately 22m lives between 1995 and 2012. 5) TB treatment success rates have risen, and remain above 85%. Despite progress, multi-drug resistant TB continues to pose serious problems, and the number of TB cases that are resistant to virtually almost all drugs available is increasing. 6) South Asian countries are on track to eliminate the neglected tropical disease visceral leishmaniasis, also known as kala azar, by 2020. The disease is the second largest parasitic killer globally after malaria. 7) More than 5bn treatments have been administered for the parasitic infection lymphatic filariasis since 2000. Of the 73 countries where the disease is known to be endemic, 39 are on track to eliminate it as a public health problem by 2020. 8) In 2013, the lowest number of human African trypanosomiasis cases were recorded in 50 years. The disease, also known as sleeping sickness, is transmitted from tsetse flies and can have cause seizures, coma and premature death. 9) The number of new HIV infections among every 100 people aged between 15 and 49 fell by 44% between 2001 and 2012. 10) By the end of 2013, approximately 12.9 million people were receiving antiretroviral therapy globally. Of these, 11.7 million lived in low- and middle-income countries. If current trends continue, the World Health Organisation says the target of placing 15 million people on antiretroviral therapy by 2015 will be reached or exceeded. 11) The number of new HIV infections in southern and central Africa fell by 48% and 54% respectively between 2001 and 2012. Despite this, an estimated 2.3 million people were newly infected. 12) Efforts to reduce the impact of HIV and Aids on children and their families continue. HIV is no longer considered a barrier to education for children who have lost parents to the virus. There is near parity in school attendance rates of orphans and non-orphans aged 10 to 14 years. 13) By the end of 2012, more than 900,000 pregnant women living with HIV globally were receiving antiretroviral treatment. Coverage of antiretroviral programmes for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission increased from 57% in 2011 to 62% in 2012. 14) In India, more than 15 million people with TB were diagnosed and treated between 1998 and 2012, saving an estimated 2.6 million lives. 15) Data indicates the stigma around HIV and Aids is slowly subsiding. In Congo-Brazzaville, 77% of pregnant women receiving prenatal care took voluntary HIV tests in 2011, compared with just 16% in 2003."
2015-06-18T06:30:10Z,global-development,Global development,What is the millennium development goal on HIV and malaria all about?,"What is MDG 6 all about? When the millennium development goals (MDGs) were devised, Aids, malaria and tuberculosis killed approximately 6 million people each year. World leaders felt it was imperative to have a goal dedicated to tackling this deadly trio. MDG 6 has two targets on HIV and Aids – the first to halt and begin to reverse the spread of the HIV virus by 2015, and the second to achieve universal access to treatment for all those who need it by 2010. Progress on these targets is measured by a range of factors, including HIV rates among young people aged 15 to 24, rates of condom use, knowledge of HIV and Aids among young people, and the number of people with advanced HIV infection who have access to antiretroviral drugs. A third target aims to halt and reverse the spread of malaria and other major diseases. This is measured by malaria incidence and related deaths, the proportion of children under five sleeping under insecticide-treated nets, and the proportion of children under five with fever who are treated with anti-malarial drugs. The only other major disease mentioned is TB, the spread of which also needs halting and reversing by 2015 under MDG 6 indicators. Why is TB the only other disease mentioned? Some health advocates have argued that by focusing on the big three killers – Aids, malaria and TB – MDG 6 has neglected other diseases, leaving them without the funding required to combat them. Plans to address the burden of other diseases have been rolled out by countries individually. The World Health Organisation has focused on 17 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) endemic in 149 countries and affecting more than 1.4 billion people. They include dengue fever, rabies, trachoma, leishmaniasis and soil-transmitted helminthiases. These diseases are prevalent in both low-income countries and wealthy regions. Dr Peter Hotez, an NTD specialist, estimates that about 12 million Americans have one or more tropical disease. Meanwhile, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which include diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancers, kill approximately 38 million people each year, with almost three-quarters of deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Despite posing a significant risk to the health and development of poorer countries, NCDs received little attention and health advocates say attracting funding has been challenging. Will the goal be met? UN data indicates that the world is on track to meet its target of halting and reversing the spread of malaria and TB, but will fail to meet all targets on HIV and Aids. Progress on malaria has been significant, but the disease remains a major killer in low-income countries. Global malaria mortality rates fell by 47% since 2000, from 985,000 malaria-related deaths in 2000 to 584,000 deaths in 2013. There was a 54% reduction in Africa. This progress has been attributed to the scaling up of malaria prevention and control methods such as greater access to diagnostic testing and treatment, increased use of insecticidal bed nets and higher rates of indoor residual spraying. The world has achieved its target to halt and reverse the spread of TB, with the prevalence of the disease falling by an estimated 41% between 1990 and 2013. Globally, the TB death rate fell by an estimated 45% in the same period. TB treatment success rates have risen and remain above 85%. Despite this progress, multi-drug resistant TB remains an obstacle. The number of new HIV infections has decreased, but not fast enough, declining by 44% among every 100 adults between 2001 and 2012. Despite this progress, there were an estimated 2.3 million cases of people newly infected with HIV and Aids, and 1.6 million Aids-related deaths. By the end of 2013, approximately 12.9 million people were receiving antiretroviral therapy globally. Of these, 11.7 million lived in low- and middle-income countries, accounting for 36% of people living with HIV in these countries. The WHO says that if current trends continue, the target of placing 15 million people on antiretroviral therapy by 2015 will be reached. Of particular concern, however, is an increase in risky sexual behaviour and insufficient knowledge about HIV among young people. The UN’s 2014 progress report found that in sub-Saharan Africa, only 39% of men and 28% of women aged between 15 and 24 had knowledge of HIV. It also found that condom use among young people who had higher-risk sex was 57% for men and 37% for women, far below the 95% target. How does MDG 6 fit into the new development goals? The sustainable development goals, set to replace the MDGs, feature a far more comprehensive list of global health targets than their predecessors. The new health goal aims to “ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages”, and encompasses 13 targets on issues such as child and maternal health, disease prevention, tobacco control, alcohol abuse, sexual and reproductive health and global health epidemics. The new goal also aims to address concerns that the MDGs sidelined NTDs and NCDs, with both groups of diseases mentioned explicitly. The targets include ending the epidemics of Aids, TB and NTDs by 2030, and reducing by one-third premature mortality from NCDs. Mental health, also absent from most MDG discussions, has been included in the SDGs. The health goal contains a target to promote mental health and wellbeing."
2015-06-18T06:00:10Z,global-development,Global development,Mothers of wisdom: Ethiopian women ensure their babies are born HIV free | Carla Kweifio-Okai,"Abeba sits in the consultation room at Modjo health clinic in central Ethiopia, her seven-month-old daughter, Aster, cooing playfully on her lap. Abeba is HIV-positive, and has travelled 20 minutes by bus to collect the antiretroviral treatment she needs. She is part of a programme at the clinic to prevent mother-to-child transmission, which involves a regimen of medications for mothers and babies during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Tests so far indicate that Aster has not contracted HIV, much to her mother’s relief. “Now I know my daughter doesn’t have it while I have it, I’m very happy,” says Abeba, who does not want her real name used. “It changes everything for me.” Despite global efforts to achieve an AIDS-free generation, in Ethiopia only 24% of pregnant women who are eligible for HIV services receive them. One out of three children born to an HIV-positive mother is infected with the virus. Abeba has three other children at home, all sons, who are also HIV-negative. She says she feels blessed that her second youngest son did not contract the virus, since she did not receive treatment while pregnant with him. “I found out I had this four years ago, but I think my son, who is five years old, was born when I was positive but without me knowing,” she says.
The eldest of Abeba’s sons is 12, and she says she will wait until he is 18 to tell him she has HIV. “I do not mind talking about it, but I want to protect my children. In the village they talk about it like it’s something very severe and something very bad to have,” she says. “But even though I don’t tell people I have it, I do tell them that we are all human beings and there’s nothing to be afraid of.” Next to the consultation room where Abeba makes her fortnightly visits, Sisay Dinku offers counselling to HIV-positive women. The 33-year-old learned she had HIV 10 years ago, and has worked at health clinics for the past nine. She says things have changed for people living with HIV in Ethiopia. “There have been a lot of improvements. When I first knew I was HIV positive, we used to go to the hospitals far away because the services weren’t given at the community centres like they are now,” Sisay says. She also notes the reduction in waiting times for people receiving their CD4 count results, which indicate how well their immune system is able to fight HIV and other infections. A person’s CD4 count determines when they should commence HIV treatment. “When I used to get tested I would have to wait one or two weeks for the test to be sent away. Sometimes you didn’t get results at all, because they would get mixed on the way there,” Sisay says. A new device providing same-day CD4 test results has helped cut waiting times for patients at the clinic. The Pima machines analyse blood samples and print reports for nurses in 20 minutes, meaning patients do not have to return to the clinic to get their results. If the results indicate HIV treatment should commence, patients can do so straight away, making it easier to begin and remain on treatment. The machines were initially funded and rolled out by global health organisation Unitaid, and the Ethiopian government has since opted to expand the programme. Sisay says improvements in HIV diagnostics have made a significant difference, particularly for monitoring pregnant women. “Let me give you an example,” she says. “When I found out I was HIV positive, there were eight other people that day who found out too, but I’m the only one that’s alive and survived. The rest of them died because they didn’t have the support and they couldn’t wait for weeks for blood samples and have to travel back to the clinic again. They got tense, they got worried, and sometimes they quit from the overall treatment. That’s the result of waiting. And I’m lucky I didn’t quit because I have a six-year-old child.” For both Sisay and Abeba, having healthy children has been a precious gift. When asked about the future she envisions for her daughter, Abeba says with a smile: “It is God’s will what she becomes when she’s older, but if you ask me, I prefer that she becomes a doctor – we are alive because of the doctors treating us.”"
2015-06-18T04:01:07Z,global-development,Global development,"One in every 122 people is displaced by war, violence and persecution, says UN","War, violence and persecution left one in every 122 humans on the planet a refugee, internally displaced or seeking asylum at the end of last year, according to a stark UN report that warns the world is failing the victims of an “age of unprecedented mass displacement”. The annual global trends study by the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, finds that the level of worldwide displacement is higher than ever before, with a record 59.5 million people living exiled from their homes at the end of 2014. UNHCR estimates that an average of 42,500 men, women and children became refugees, asylum seekers or internally displaced people every day last year - a four-fold increase in just four years. By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees – more than half of them children – 38.2 million internally displaced people and 1.8 million asylum-seekers. Were the 59.5 million to be counted as the population of a single country, it would be the 24th largest in the world and one with about the same number of people as Italy.
The numbers are up 16% on 2013 – when the total stood at 51.2 million – and up 59% on a decade ago, when 37.5 million people were forced to flee their homes. UNHCR says the four-year war in Syria is the single largest driver of displacement: by the end of 2014, the conflict had forced 3.88 million Syrians to live as refugees in the Middle East and beyond, and left 7.6 million more internally displaced. In blunter terms, one in every five displaced persons worldwide last year was Syrian. The UN high commissioner for refugees, António Guterres, said that although the world was experiencing “an unchecked slide” into an era of massive forced global displacement, it seemed unwilling to tackle the causes. “It is terrifying that on the one hand there is more and more impunity for those starting conflicts, and on the other there is [a] seeming utter inability of the international community to work together to stop wars and build and preserve peace,” he said. The report also notes that the wealthy countries are relying overwhelmingly on poorer states to take in those who have been forced to abandon their homelands: in 2014, 86% of refugees were in regions or countries deemed economically less developed. Twenty years ago, developing regions hosted about 70% of the world’s refugees; last year, countries ranked least developed by the UN were home to 3.6 million refugees – or 25% of the global total. Guterres called on the international community to show resolve, tolerance and a proper financial commitment to helping those most in need. “With huge shortages of funding and wide gaps in the global regime for protecting victims of war, people in need of compassion, aid and refuge are being abandoned,” he said. “For an age of unprecedented mass displacement, we need an unprecedented humanitarian response and a renewed global commitment to tolerance and protection for people fleeing conflict and persecution.” Guterres’ warning comes a year after the UNHCR reported that the number of people forced to flee their homes across the world had exceeded 50 million for the first time since the second world war. At the end of 2014, 53% of all refugees under UNHCR’s responsibility came from just three countries: Syria (3.88 million), Afghanistan (2.59 million), and Somalia (1.11 million). A further 5.1 million refugees were registered by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.
In Iraq, the march of Islamic State saw the number of internally displaced people jump from 1 million to in 2013 to 3.6 million by the end of last year. In Libya, 309,000 people were newly displaced in 2014. Over the past five years, at least 15 conflicts have broken out or reignited: eight in Africa (Ivory Coast, Central African Republic, Libya, Mali, northeastern Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Burundi); three in the Middle East (Syria, Iraq, and Yemen); one in Europe (Ukraine) and three in Asia (Kyrgyzstan, and in several areas of Burma and Pakistan). With few of those conflicts resolved and most still forcing people to flee, just 126,800 refugees were able to return to their home countries last year – the lowest number in 31 years. In Europe, the number of forcibly displaced people increased by 51% last year, rising from 4.4 million to 7.6 million. “More than 219,000 refugees and migrants crossed the Mediterranean sea during 2014,” says the report. “That’s almost three times the previously known high of about 70,000, which took place in 2011 during the ‘Arab spring’. Nearly half of these arrivals were coming from the Syrian Arab republic and Eritrea. UNHCR has received information of over 3,500 women, men, and children reported dead or missing in the Mediterranean sea during the year, clearly demonstrating how dangerous and unpredictable this situation has become.” UNHCR noted that the record number of Mediterranean crossings and the huge number of Syrians hosted by Turkey had “brought increased public attention, both positive and negative, to questions to do with refugees”, adding that Germany and Sweden had received the largest volume of asylum applications. Displacement was up 19% in the Middle East and north Africa; up 17% in sub-Saharan Africa; up 31% in Asia, and up 12% in the Americas.
Last year saw Turkey overtake Pakistan to became the largest refugee-hosting country worldwide, with 1.59 million refugees, the overwhelming majority of them Syrian. Pakistan hosted the second-largest number of refugees – 1.51 million, almost all of them from Afghanistan – while Lebanon took in the most refugees in relation to its population, with 232 refugees per 1,000 inhabitants. Iran hosted 950,000 Afghan refugees, Ethiopia 659,500 refugees from South Sudan, Eritrea and Somalia, while Jordan hosted 654,100 refugees from Syria and Iraq. Justine Greening, the international development secretary, said: “It is shocking that nearly 60 million people are now without a home and dependent on the kindness of strangers. One in seven of those men, women and children have been forced to flee because of conflict or persecution in the last year alone. “From Syria to South Sudan, the UK is getting emergency help to people who have lost everything. I have met some of these people and they tell me they just want the chance to return to their homes and get back to normal. “That is why, as we give these families the basics they need to survive – food, clean water and shelter – we must also tackle the root causes of poverty and instability, in particular economic development.” • This article was amended on 18 June 2015. An earlier version suggested that refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and Somalia made up more than half of all refugees worldwide. To clarify: they make up more than half of all refugees under UNHCR’s responsibility; 5.1 million of the total 19.5 million refugees come under the separate mandate of UNWRA."
2015-06-17T23:01:01Z,global-development,Global development,"Global humanitarian aid hits record high but needs remain unmet, finds study","Global humanitarian assistance rose to record levels in 2014, reflecting the scale and scope of prolonged crises such as the conflicts in Iraq and Syria as well as increased contributions from Middle Eastern donors, according to a study by the non-profit organisation Development Initiatives. A report by the body’s Global Humanitarian Assistance (GHA) programme showed that humanitarian assistance rose to $24.5bn (£15.5bn) last year, an increase of 19% on 2013. Middle Eastern donors contributed nearly $1.7bn, a 120% increase on the previous year. Needs continued to outstrip contributions, however. In its coordinated appeals, the UN fell $7.5bn short of the record $19.5bn it requested to help 87.5 million people. This meant 38% of requirements were not met, even though the world’s leading donors all gave more.
“In a year of global discussions on development and climate change, these unprecedented levels of need and continued shortfalls in funding highlight the need to sustainably address the underlying causes and long-term impacts of crisis,” said Sophia Swithern, head of the GHA programme. Next month, the UN will hold its third international conference on financing for development in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. Member states are expected to draw up concrete plans to finance the sustainable development goals, an ambitious agenda covering the next 15 years that is due to be ratified in New York this September. “We see from the figures in the report that 93% of the world’s extreme poor are in countries that are politically fragile or environmentally vulnerable,” said Swithern. “Unless something comes out of Addis and around the SDGs that looks at the poverty questions around those crisis-related areas, you are not going to end poverty and you are not going to solve crises.” Last year, 10.7 million more people worldwide were affected by natural disasters compared with 2013, while conflict and persecution created a record number of displaced people. The report noted that the Ebola crisis received significant support that was not categorised as humanitarian assistance, so the total amount for the year might be higher than the headline figure. The rise in overall humanitarian funding reflected the fact that there were now more people displaced in the Middle East than in Africa.
The Syria crisis drew the largest appeals; along with the ongoing conflict in Iraq and the situation in South Sudan, it became a significant driver in last year’s $4bn rise in humanitarian funding. “The domestic contributions of countries hosting Syrian and Iraqi refugees, most notably Turkey, also continue to be vital,” the report said. In 2013, Turkey spent $1.6bn helping Syrian refugees. Saudi Arabia joined the list of the top 10 donors after it increased its humanitarian funding by $518m, to $755m. This was the second highest volume increase of all donors, amounting to a trebling of the country’s 2013 commitment. The United Arab Emirates became one of the 20 largest contributors after raising its contribution by 317%, from $90m in 2013 to $375m in 2014.
“[Middle Eastern donors] have been key players for a long time, but with the rise of conflict in the region … we are seeing these donors rising in prominence,” Swithern said. She added that this was partly down to more standardised reporting by these donors, with whom the world should engage to ensure the quality and quantity of the funding stream. Contributions from private donors rose by an estimated 8%, and accounted for a quarter of international humanitarian assistance. As a group, private donors were the largest international contributor to the typhoon Haiyan response in 2013, and the third largest supporters of the Ebola response last year. The report noted that two-thirds of international humanitarian assistance still went to long-term recipients such as Somalia and Pakistan. Despite widespread acknowledgement of the importance of local NGOs in delivering relief, initial data from 2014 found that their direct share of total humanitarian funding had halved, from 0.4% in 2012 to 0.2% in 2014. However, data gaps meant it was very hard to trace money all the way from donors to recipients, making it difficult to measure funding to local and national NGOs. “There is a real groundswell at the moment talking about localising the response in recognition of the role of local and national actors as the first and, in many cases, the best responders,” Swithern said. She added that more analysis was required to determine how to improve these organisations’ access to direct funds. New sources of funding were needed from more diverse donors as well as more efficient methods of delivering the money to those in need, the report said. These issues will be discussed at the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul next year, and Swithern said private funding would be a particular focus. “This resource that we call international humanitarian assistance is just one piece of the picture,” she said. “What we need is a comprehensive solution that involves different mixes of resources for different contexts.”"
2015-06-17T14:47:02Z,global-development,Global development,"Congolese troops must be disarmed if rapes are to stop, says Denis Mukwege","The Congolese army is mired in a culture of sexual violence and should be disarmed because many of its troops are “completely sick”, according to one of the country’s leading gynaecologists. Dr Denis Mukwege said soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) should be stripped of their weapons and replaced by new recruits who have never committed sexual violence or fought for a violent militia. Rapists in the the Forces Armées de la République Démocratique (FARDC), he added, ought also to be considered “victims” because they were traumatised by involvement in one of Africa’s most brutal and longest-running wars and needed psychological help that was not available. Alluding to the town in eastern Congo where Congolese soldiers committed mass rape in 2012, Mukwege said: “In Minova and other places it is the FARDC who are the ones who were raping instead of protecting the population. The FARDC has shown that the army can destroy its population, it’s a big problem. “If we want to fight against sexual violence then we need to be courageous and say that we need to create an army where people have never been in a militia before or have never been involved in rape or destruction.” Mukwege, 59, who was last year awarded the EU’s highest human rights award, the Sakharov Prize, for saving the lives of thousands of rape victims, also questioned the wisdom of the international community ploughing large sums of money into a military that routinely perpetrates sexual violence.
Mukwege said: “The UK and other countries are spending a lot of money to try and build an army from people who are completely sick and destroyed. They will never succeed.” According to UN estimates, more than a third of the rapes that occur in the eastern part of the country are committed by the army. Mukwege’s comments follow the revelation that, despite spending £5.2m on hosting a high-profile summit on ending sexual violence in conflict, the UK government has committed less than a fifth of that amount to tackling rape in warzones in 2015. A UK parliamentary inquiry will this week begin scrutinising Hague’s initiative and also details of an Observer investigation that found rapists in the army are still operating with impunity within eastern DRC, where Mukwege’s Panzi hospital has helped treat more than 30,000 survivors of sexual violence perpetrated by the military and militias. Mukwege said: “We should be more courageous. Why can’t we start sending the FARDC to do social work like fixing roads, protecting houses or producing food? They can keep their uniforms but not their guns, that way they can be useful for society.” Mukwege added that many military recruits had already fought for violent militia and committed rape, meaning that sexual violence was woven into the mindset of the country’s military. “Many of the perpetrators are themselves victims because many of them were children when they joined the army and there is no psychological support to help them,” said Mukwege. “We are trying to build something with people who are mentally unsafe … studies show that most have post-traumatic stress disorder. How can you give them guns?”
On Sunday an investigation found that the biggest rape tribunal in the country’s history was allegedly fixed by the government and military prosecutors, while rape prosecutions in eastern DRC have fallen and incidents of sexual violence increased despite political pledges at the London summit to act on sexual violence in conflict. The findings raise questions about the UK government’s commitment to the issue, with data from freedom of information requests revealing that last year just one trip was made to the Congo by a member of the UK team dedicated to sexual violence. Funding to the DRC from the Department for International Development (DfID) is £149m this year, a portion of which is dedicated to helping the country’s army “increase their ability to fight against impunity”. Other initiatives aimed at defence reform in the country. In addition, the Ministry of Defence says that a handful of officers are based in the east of the country, “working with the UN and Congolese government”. Despite such efforts, Congoloese troops continue to be implicated in ongoing sexual violence. Rebecca Masika Katsuva, who runs a women’s refuge in Minova, calculates that of the 800 rape victims her centre has helped since the start of 2014, 600 were attacked by the army. Emmanuel Baboo, of the Heal Africa hospital in Goma, which treats up to 10,000 victims of sexual violence a year, describes cases where soldiers from the 10th military region in eastern Congo deliberately rape children to “corrupt” them early."
2015-06-17T13:25:31Z,global-development,Global development,Afghan men urged to support HeForShe campaign at Kabul launch,"In Kabul on Tuesday a group of Afghan men took the very rare step of calling on their male compatriots to take a stand for women’s rights. They made their appeal at the Afghanistan launch of HeForShe, a UN campaign for gender equality known worldwide thanks partly to the actor Emma Watson. “A Brave Man Stands for Women” was the slogan emblazoned on a banner in the hall of a Kabul high school where activists and foreign dignitaries of both genders gathered for the occasion. . The organisers are aiming to enlist manliness and valour in pursuit of the cause, perhaps recognising that gender equality is a hard sell in a male-dominated society shaped by decades of war. “This male bravery that has been created, we should use that to defend women’s rights,” one motivational speaker, Zia Mobalegh, said from the stage. “Men of Afghanistan should be courageous enough to create gender equality.” The campaign signals a change in approach from international donors. Since 2001, gender equality has been a pillar of western aid in Afghanistan, but it almost exclusively targeted women. “A lot of the problems that women face in this country arise from how we men look at society,” Barry Salaam, a prominent activist, said. He was made aware of Afghanistan’s gender gap at the age of 12 when his sister was discriminated against at school. “Looking at her, I always felt guilty,” he said. “Unless we men change ourselves and the way we view women, we won’t be able to bring fundamental changes.” The UN plans to roll out the campaign in five other provinces as well as Kabul: Balkh, Herat, Bamiyan, Nangarhar and Kandahar. But the farther away from the conference halls of the capital, the stauncher the opposition to disruption of the social order. “These things are really sensitive for men here,” said Ramin Anwari, an activist and former journalist. He said many men fear that emancipation of women will cost them their own privileges. “Women’s rights have been framed as absolute freedom for women, which Afghanistan is not ready for. There is a big need to reframe the struggle so it’s not offensive to the men that have dominated society throughout history.”
Ameer Mohammad Dareenori, a tribal elder from Nangarhar, was not worried about losing privileges, and fully supported gender equality in the legal system and the workplace, he said, chastising the few attending parliamentarians for leaving the launch early. “That’s a disgrace,” he said. Dareenori, however, stressed that equality must be contingent on the word of Islamic scriptures, including laws stipulating that a woman’s testimony is worth half of a man’s, as well as family and marital laws allowing men to take four wives, to provide for them. A woman should not have the same right, he said, as more than one husband would create confusion about who was the father of her children. If equality has eluded Afghan women during the past 14 years, it is not for lack of money. As late as October last year, the US launched its largest gender awareness programme, Promote. The US international development agency, USAid, has committed $216m (£137m) to the programme, while other donors are expected to contribute an extra $200m. The programme, has been criticised, however, for not consulting the Afghan women it is meant to support. Lack of consultation has been a problem, said some activists, who see promising signs that foreign donors will now give Afghan organisations more autonomy. Telling Afghans what to do “has created a lot of backlash”, said Mariam Safi, executive director of Drops, a civil society organisation. “Finally, the international community is looking into implementing local ownership,” she said. “That gives local organisations space to implement programs with relation to women’s rights.” Since taking office in September, the government of president Ashraf Ghani has taken a few strides to improve female representation in the political and legal system. His wife, Rula Ghani, has assumed a more public role than any other Afghan first lady of the past 50 years. After appointing four female ministers in April, Ghani on Sunday named the first female judge, Anisa Rassouli, to the supreme court. That is “tangible proof”, said Elzira Sagynbaeva, the representative of UN Women in Afghanistan, that “the unity government is committed to tackling the issues faced by women and girls in Afghanistan”. Asked whether western gender campaigns should have targeted men earlier, Sagynbaeva said: “It’s a very good point … The last 10 years were all about women fighting for women.” HeForShe seeks to motivate local students, elders and religious teachers to create awareness in communities. Real improvement requires deep institutional and cultural changes. Kabul is still reeling from an incident three months ago when Farkhunda, a 27-year-old-woman, was viciously beaten to death by a mob. The incident sparked the largest protests for women’s rights in recent memory, and became a symbol of discrimination of women and their lack of legal protection. To Salaam, the activist, HeForShe finally puts the onus on men in a country where women are often seen as instigators of conflict, even when they are beaten, raped or escape abuse. “That mindset has to change, and it comes from men. It’s a problem of men that should be solved by men. Women are just the victims,” he said."
2015-06-17T08:00:02Z,global-development,Global development,UK expert warns of disaster if lessons are not learned from Ebola outbreak,"Failure to learn the lessons of the Ebola outbreak will have unthinkable consequences when the next global health emergency erupts, the former head of the UK’s Ebola taskforce in Sierra Leone has warned. Donal Brown, who led British efforts to tackle the disease in the west African country, said the outbreak had exposed serious technical and collaborative failings in the international community’s response mechanisms. “We got off lightly on Ebola as a global community and we couldn’t even respond properly to that,” he said. Brown declared that not only was the response late because international alert systems were not working properly, it was also hampered by “an ongoing debate” as to whether the outbreak should be treated as a health emergency or a humanitarian one. “It was both, very clearly – and we need to ensure that we’ve got systems that speak to each other so we’re not in a thing about should it be the World Health Organisation (WHO) leading this or should it be a UN humanitarian response. This is a complex health-humanitarian emergency and our systems need to be able to lead that together,” he said. Brown, a former vet who is now head of the Department for International Development’s (DfID) global funds department, said that the situation would have been immeasurably worse if the world had been dealing with a respiratory-borne infection rather than one spread, like Ebola, through bodily fluids. “I have seen the consequences in animal populations of airborne diseases and I just cannot contemplate that in a human population,” he said. “We have to learn the lessons. There is no option. It is so frightening if we don’t learn the lessons. I will keep going and ensure that whether it’s the Department for International Development in London or anywhere else, it’s something we don’t let drop.”
Brown welcomed David Cameron’s announcement of the creation of a team of “disease detectives” – epidemiologists and infection control specialists who would be ready to deploy in response to outbreaks – but said the challenges of epidemics could not be met by technology alone. “The UK and the international community can bring all the weapons – the labs and the treatment centres – but we’re foreigners,” he said. “We can support you, but we can’t change behaviours. We don’t even understand the subtleties of your culture. I think people underestimate just how difficult it is. You can’t just press a button and change behaviour. You can’t just sign a cheque and change behaviour. It’s about person-to-person engagement. It’s about verbal communication.” Brown pointed to Sierra Leone, which reported 15 cases of Ebola in the week ending 7 June, saying such flare-ups were inevitable because of secret burials – “which have been just a nightmare” – and the reliance on traditional herbalists. “It’s all about behaviour change and cultural practices,” he said. “People still go to herbalists – and you can’t blame them, because in the UK you’ll get people going to herbalists or to alternative medicine when it’s clear that it has its place but it certainly won’t cure certain things. In a quite uneducated, poor population, it’s even harder to change that behaviour.” Equally difficult, if equally understandable, said Brown, was the complacency resulting from people’s desire to reclaim their lives and routines. “That’s what this is all about, complacency from everybody – government, population and so on – because people are so fed up with Ebola they just want a normal life,” he said. “They want their school to function properly, they want to be able to go to shops and restaurants and so on. So you get the complacency and then you get people who still go on with traditional practices, which just fuel it each time.” Despite the new cases, Brown said he was reassured to note that the Western Area of Sierra Leone – which includes the capital, Freetown – had just recorded its first week without a single case of Ebola. “When I left in February, we were down to just under 50 cases a week from 500 cases a week in mid-November and we all agreed that this was going to be a long, bumpy tail,” he said. “We can’t be complacent but I wouldn’t say I’m unduly worried because it’s gone up from 10 to 15 each week. If you look at it, it’s gone up a bit and down a bit. It hasn’t gone up massively.” But Brown added there was still more to be done to make sure more cases were recorded on contact lists to minimise infection and on tackling the disease in Guinea and shoring up its border with Sierra Leone. “We know there’s a lot of movement across that border and we know it’s going to be very difficult to totally eradicate Ebola in Sierra Leone until you get on top of it in Guinea,” he said. Brown, who was awarded a CBE for services to international development in the Queen’s birthday honours list, said he hoped that humanitarian and health agencies would learn to work better together in the wake of Ebola and in the run-up to next year’s world humanitarian summit. “One of the key things we need to do is not only ensure that the lessons are learned around WHO, but it’s equally important that lessons are learned about why the humanitarian response could have been better,” he said."
2015-06-17T04:01:08Z,global-development,Global development,"Global cost of conflict reaches $14.3tn, says report","The world’s steady shift away from peace and into conflict inflicted a $14.3tn (£9.21tn) cost on the global economy last year, as nations ramped up military spending and more people were driven from their jobs, according to the latest Global Peace Index (GPI). Fighting in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan had wreaked havoc on economies and helped push the level of peace in the world to its lowest since 2008, the index showed. Providing services for refugees and internally displaced people was one of the biggest costs of last year’s violence. In 2014, the world spent 13.4% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on costs associated with violence, equivalent to the total economic output of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the UK, according to the GPI. More than $3tn was poured into military spending. Syria kept its spot as the world’s least peaceful country. Libya, which has seen deepening sectarian conflict since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, slipped more than any other country in the rankings over the past year, followed by Ukraine, Niger, Djibouti and South Sudan.
The index, published annually since 2008, ranks 162 countries on 23 indicators with the aim of painting a portrait of each country’s level of security, conflict engagement and militarisation. This year’s index showed that 81 countries have become more peaceful in the past year, while 78 registered deepening violence. “We use the absence of violence or fear of violence as the definition of peace,” said Steve Killelea, the founder and executive chairman of the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) thinktank, which produces the GPI. Internal and external measures of peacefulness are assessed by an expert panel against themes of militarisation, ongoing conflict and societal and safety measures. The 2015 index shows “an inequality in peace” – with the world’s most peaceful countries showing the most improvements in peacefulness, while the least peaceful countries descending into further violence, said Killelea. The biggest deteriorations in peace resulted from a rise in the number of refugees and in more deaths from internal conflicts. The number of deaths has increased from 50,000 in 2008 to 180,000 last year, Killelea said. But there were encouraging improvements in political stability, he said. Guinea-Bissau, praised in March by the EU for restoring its constitution and holding elections, showed the biggest improvement in this year’s index. Ivory Coast, Egypt, Tajikistan and Benin were among the most reformed countries. However, prolonged conflict continues to pose grave economic problems. The conflict in Syria, where a civil war has been raging for four years, was estimated to have absorbed 42% of the country’s GDP. Afghanistan spent 31% of its GDP on containing violence, while Iraq spent 30%.
Iceland came top of the 2015 index, followed by Denmark, Austria, New Zealand, Switzerland, Finland, Canada, Japan, Australia and the Czech Republic. The UK ranked 39th, eight spots better than last year. The US came in at 94th place, one spot above Saudi Arabia. Europe was the most peaceful region. Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, South Sudan and Central African Republic were the bottom five countries in the index. The Middle East and north Africa bore the highest cost of violence. But Killelea cautioned that “one has to be realistic when looking at trying to measure a complex phenomena such as peace and doing it across the globe”, admitting that gaps in data do exist. The 2015 GPI showed fewer conflicts between states and more within states. Last year, external conflicts were responsible for 74% fewer deaths than in 2008, the GPI showed. Killelea warned that the rise in violence carried out by terrorist groups is likely to worsen in the coming years. Terrorist networks have expanded their scope of operations and carried out 61% more killings last year than in 2008. He said Nigeria, which suffers the second-most terrorists attacks of any country, would bear the brunt of more terrorist violence. “We’re going to see a massive increase in the deaths resulting from Boko Haram,” he said, referring to Nigeria’s Islamist insurgency."
2015-06-16T11:33:22Z,global-development,Global development,African leaders must take ‘concrete steps’ to end child marriage,"African leaders need to back their political ambitions to end child marriage with effective policies and the money to see them through, according to a global partnership fighting to end the practice. On the annual Day of the African Child on Tuesday, which this year focuses on child marriage, Françoise Kpeglo Moudouthe, head of Africa engagement at Girls Not Brides, said the continent’s leaders had taken big steps in making political commitments to end the practice, but needed to do more. “There’s a lot happening, but not as fast as needed. Part of the problem … there’s a lot of political commitment, which is great, but we have not yet got to the point where we’re organising ourselves to have affected a concentrated approach. It’s time to come together and build on the political momentum and address this issue,” she said. “Many African governments have taken that step politically. But let’s make that a holistic commitment, a social commitment, a policy commitment and a financial commitment.” According to the latest UN estimates, every year around 15 million girls marry before they are 18. Around 40% of girls in sub-Saharan Africa are married before their 18th birthdays, and 12% before they turn 15. As well as robbing girls, and boys, of their childhood, child marriage can also have devastating physical consequences. Young brides are more likely to give birth when their bodies are not fully developed, which can lead to injuries such as fistula.
The UN children’s agency, Unicef, says 15 of the 20 countries identified as having the highest prevalence of child marriage are in Africa. Niger tops the list, with 76% of women aged between 20 and 24 saying they were married or in a union before they were 18. Central African Republic and Chad follow, both with 68%. Some 33 African countries have set 18 as the minimum age for marriage for both girls and boys. Four – Algeria, Lesotho, Libya and Rwanda – have set the age limit higher. In Rwanda, the legal age for marriage for both sexes is 21, while Algeria has set the age limit at 19. Despite these laws, some countries continue to allow girls to marry younger if their parents consent. Last year the African Union launched a campaign to end child marriage in the 10 countries with the highest rates. The AU plans to hold a summit on ending the practice in November. But Moudouthe said the political will needs to be turned into action. “Right now we know if you want to move from commitment to concrete change, and impact on the lives of our girls, we need effective leadership, and civil society and other institutions to work together to advance as fast as needed and required.”
Moudouthe said she wanted to see built a social movement “that involves all of us”, to push for an end to child marriage. National strategies need to be developed to address the problem – such as through compulsory birth registration so there is no doubt about a girls age, and decent education so girls are made aware of their rights and have the skills to exercise them, she said. Poverty, which is often cited by parents as a reason for marrying off their daughters, will also need to be addressed by leaders. Families and community chiefs will need to be mobilised to drive change locally. But all that will require a long-term commitment, says Moudouthe, which needs to be borne in mind by governments setting new policies, and by donors committing programme funds. “Child marriage is not going to be ended overnight. Something we all need to understand is that we’re in for a long fight.” The proposed sustainable development goals, set to come into force in January, include a target to eliminate child marriage by 2030. The Day of the African Child was established in 1991 to commemorate the 1976 Soweto student uprising in South Africa, in which hundreds of young people were killed or injured."
2015-06-16T09:58:16Z,global-development,Global development,Secret aid worker: it's one standard for local staff and another for expats,"While working as an international adviser for an NGO in an African country, I contracted malaria and it got worse as opposed to better with treatment. After one agonising night on a morphine drip in the local hospital, a call was placed to my employer’s insurance provider, and five hours later an air ambulance was on the ground to medivac me out of the country. I was whisked safely to a more developed country nearby, where world-class medical care awaited me. The whole thing cost more than $200,000; insurance paid. Some time later one of my national colleagues – the longest-serving team member – was involved in a road traffic accident on his way home from work. He lay unconscious on the roadside for 15 minutes, his leg shattered. As Ebola ravaged the country and accessing healthcare became harder than ever, he spent nine days in limbo, before being flown to the same country that I had been treated in, and another 11 days waiting there before the necessary surgery was performed. It took 20 days from accident to surgery. Twenty days through which he lay in uncertainty, fear, and excruciating pain.
During this time a number of individuals within the NGO went to enormous lengths to make the necessary happen. They planned, they negotiated, they fundraised. They called in favours, they pulled strings. Meanwhile the NGO prevaricated, debated and delayed. My former colleague’s treatment cost in the region of $40,000. He had no insurance. The NGO eventually contributed $15,000. The rest came from the pockets of current and former colleagues. Two tiers of staff These two tales provide just one example of an issue that runs across much of the aid and development sector. The NGO in question says: “We do not draw any distinction between our international and national staff when it comes to medical insurance – we make strenuous efforts to keep all of our staff safe and well regardless of where they come from. Any suggestion otherwise in this article is incorrect and misleading.” I disagree. And I want to draw attention to the inequality here: to the disparity between the treatment of locally engaged (usually national) support staff and their (usually international) professionally skilled colleagues. This article focuses on the ethical, moral and legal issues involved in determining that some staff members have their lives saved by their employer and others do not. But it is worth remembering that, in many NGOs, much of what follows applies not only to healthcare provision, but to working hours, overtime, days off, notice periods, termination requirements … the list goes on.
Why the inequality? I have heard five reasons for discrepancies in employment terms that mean international staff typically receive medical insurance as standard and national staff typically do not. We can’t afford it. We simply cannot extend a more equitable level of benefits to our national staff because it would cost too much, our funding is restricted and we have to spend our money on our core business. We don’t need to. Our policies are in line with other international organisations, we comply fully with employment legislation and our legal duty of care to contractors. And anyway, our national staff members are much better off than they would be if they didn’t work for us. It’s not an option. International evacuation insurance isn’t even available to cover national staff. There are good reasons for the way it is. It’s unfair yes, but we don’t pay all staff equally either. Doing so would create a harmful dual economy. First things first. We’re a small NGO, newly established. We do the best we can for now, while we focus on our strategic objectives. But these excuses don’t stack up. Let’s consider them one by one: Cost. Morally, this argument betrays a hierarchy of values placed on different lives. There is also a countering reputational cost to be considered. Since the job above, I have worked with international organisations that have evacuated drivers, and paid cleaners full maternity leave without batting an eyelid – in part (I’m cynically sure) because they’re smart enough to know that they risk being associated with failing to do the right thing. Lack of obligation. Just because national staff are often lucky to have their jobs and local economic conditions mean they will not – cannot – complain, does not excuse any employer who takes advantage of their lack of voice. International NGOs should be setting an example. They should be better than that. And equating legality with morality is perhaps the weakest argument of the lot. Lack of options. Where this is the case, it can be worked around. Figure out in advance what’s possible. Find a balance. Set up self insurance. Offer full local health coverage at least. Good reasons not to. Lots of things aren’t equitable, true. But there are good reasons why, for example, some salaries are paid at local rates and others at international ones: this avoids the creation of a dual economy in which drivers working for an international NGO are paid many times more than doctors or lawyers. The same doesn’t apply to health care. Lack of priority. “We do the best we can” is simply not good enough. International NGOs cannot be given a free ride on the claim of well-intended charity: they are part of a global multi-billion dollar business and they need to up their game. This includes getting the basics sorted out from the start.
National support staff deserve better These issues are challenging both ethically and practically. Although they got part way there in the end, it took days for my former employer to work through fiduciary issues, legal liabilities and financial concerns before they were able to decide how much they could and would do to help my former colleague. These issues should have been worked through long before he lay waiting in agony. In the midst of all the development industry’s concerns of “do we really make any difference”, the only thing they can be completely sure of influencing is the lives of the people they directly touch. International NGOs purport to make the world a better place. They have to get their own houses in order first. Do you have a secret aid worker story you’d like to tell?

2015-06-16T06:00:11Z,global-development,Global development,Médecins Sans Frontières head criticises G7 for lack of urgency over Ebola,"Aid donors missed a golden opportunity at the G7 summit in Germany to lay out measures for a far more vigorous response to epidemics such as the Ebola outbreak, according to Joanne Liu, the head of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). “There were strong opening remarks from Angela Merkel at the G7, saying we have failed on Ebola, we take full responsibility, but at the end, the recommendations were all watered down,” said Liu. “With Ebola, there was a fear factor. In September, the world held its breath as a huge terrible threat was over our heads. That sense of urgency has been lost, and I’m concerned things will not change.” Ebola has killed more than 11,000 people in the three worst affected west African states of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia since March 2014. The World Health Organisation (WHO) did not declare the Ebola outbreak a public health emergency until August, despite 60 different chains of transmission in Guinea and warnings from MSF four months earlier. But Liu said tackling the outbreak was not the WHO’s sole responsibility. “Since the beginning I’ve been asking member states to show political responsibility in responding, but they didn’t and I think they’ve been let off the hook. It’s very convenient to have a scapegoat like WHO,” she said.
Liu wrote to Britain’s chancellor, George Osbourne, before the meeting on 7-8 June stressing how disease control is a public good, but the G7 provided no concrete solutions for fighting epidemics, and showed little will to reform the WHO, despite criticising it heavily. Liu said countries should be rewarded rather than punished for declaring an outbreak. Low-income countries, more prone to outbreaks, are hit the hardest by political and economic sanctions such as travel bans, she added. “If states declared earlier, the machine could move faster. But you see it everywhere, cholera in Haiti, meningitis in Niger, measles in the DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo]. Each time we have to fight for them to declare, because they’re scared of the repercussions,” she said. “I am absolutely convinced there should be financial and political incentives for states to declare. You shouldn’t be the pariah of the world if you say you have Ebola, but in reality this is what happens,” she said. Liu is open to establishing a rapid response unit, proposed by health leaders ahead of the G7, with an “emergency mindset” working with an agency like the WHO to fight disease, but only if there is a paradigm shift in the way the organisation responds to outbreaks. “In Canada, I’m an ER physician. My hospital director wouldn’t ask me to visit outpatients. They know where I’m best, in ER. Similarly, I would want only people with emergency mindsets, not developmental, to do emergency response.” Ebola vaccines need to be ready before the start of the next epidemic, said Liu. However, she has reservations about measures to increase surveillance or build regional centres to test for infectious diseases. “People have this fantasy that surveillance will help the next epidemic. The reality is, despite not having complete data, we still had enough to know that we had to scale up our response,” said Liu. “But we didn’t.”
Those countries with larger economies had to be prepared to move in quickly after an outbreak and get their hands dirty on the ground, said Liu. Such a response could encourage other states to step up. “When President Obama pledged a 25-bed facility for healthcare workers, I remember having him on the phone and saying: ‘Thank you very much, that’s a good start.’ And it was followed by this long, awkward silence,” said Liu. She added that she told Obama: “If the world’s biggest economy isn’t pledging high, then who will?”. The UN’s financial tracking system shows that the scale of giving among G7 states varied greatly. Italy gave 0.3% of the total Ebola budget, while the US contributed about 45% . The UK gave roughly 10%. But, frustratingly, the $1.7bn of US funding did not reap the rewards it could have, Liu noted. “Unlike the Cubans, the US were not ready to expose their people. So even though they opened 11 centres with 150 beds each in Liberia, they treated just 28 people, because they deployed late, and refused to staff the centres. “Nations don’t have friends, they have interests. The best motivation for a state to act if it is remote from an epidemic is if its own security is at risk. “The downside is you keep waiting for a bigger and bigger monster to come, and by the time it hits you, it has already caused considerable damage elsewhere. As humanitarians, we can’t wait that long to act,” she said."
