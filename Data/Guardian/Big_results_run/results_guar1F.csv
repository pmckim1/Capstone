2020-06-01T19:16:31Z,politics,Politics,Tom Watson peerage rejected by Lords vetting commission,"The commission that vets potential new members of the House of Lords has turned down peerage nominations for the former Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, the former Speaker John Bercow and ex-Labour official Karie Murphy, it is understood. The three were all put forward for peerages by Jeremy Corbyn when, as Labour leader, he was asked for nominations in the honours drawn up for the dissolution of parliament in December, which have yet to be announced. It is understood that the party has been told all have been turned down by the independent House of Lords appointment commission. As they were put forward by Corbyn, it would be up to him to suggest any replacement peers, rather than the new party leadership. Downing Street has been publicly sceptical about a peerage for Bercow, who was the subject of a series of bullying claims, which he vehemently denies. Asked about the blocked peerages, Boris Johnson’s spokesman said he could not confirm them: “We’ve previously said that the allegations against John Bercow were very concerning and that they needed to be investigated thoroughly. “But all nominations are subject to independent vetting by the House of Lords appointments commission for propriety before their appointment, and we don’t comment in advance on individual nominations.” Asked about the cases of Watson and Murphy, the spokesman again stressed this was a matter for the commission, but added: “There is no automatic entitlement to a peerage for any holder of high office.” Some reports had suggested concern about Watson’s peerage because of his role in seeking action over allegations of sexual abuse which included highlighting the claims of Carl Beech, who turned out to be a serial fantasist. Beech was jailed last year for 18 years after a court found he had fabricated allegations about a murderous VIP paedophile ring in Westminster. Police had raided the homes of the late military chief Lord Bramall, the late Lord Brittan and the former MP Harvey Proctor based on the allegations. Defenders of Watson have said that it is unfair to blame him for police failings, and that all he did was highlight the issue. Watson stood down as an MP at the last election. Denying Bercow a peerage would breach the convention that former Speakers are put into the Lords. Bercow has said he is the victim of a “conspiracy” to keep him out of the upper house."
2020-06-01T19:13:10Z,politics,Politics,Following the science is so over for Matt. Now fetch him his lucky tie | John Crace,"Some things don’t change. Like Matt Hancock wearing the same lucky pink tie he has worn every day for the past two weeks. Let’s just hope for his family’s sake he doesn’t also have lucky pants and socks. But some things do change. “We’re going to do this a little bit differently today,” the health secretary said at the start of the daily Downing Street press conference. He wasn’t going to waste everybody’s time by reading a statement that people would inevitably pick holes in. He wasn’t even going to crow about the government’s success in containing the coronavirus that had led to that very day’s easing of lockdown restrictions. Not even a huge thank you for the national resolve that has meant some people could now watch the racing from Newcastle. Instead, we got the brusque Matt, a man just keen to get the whole pantomime over and done with as fast as possible. Hancock has had enough and is at breaking point. In the early days of the pandemic, he was still enthusiastic: the Tigger who was thrilled to find himself at the centre of a national crisis and to be on TV nearly every day. Now the thrill has gone. Boris Johnson still gets allowances made for having had coronavirus but no one gives Matt any leeway at all. He’s just the bloke who’s sent out time and again to defend the indefensible. He knows he’s the Muppet who is being lined up as the government fall guy but he’s in too deep to back out now. Even assuming he had the self-worth to tell Boris and his cabinet colleagues where to get off. Naught’s had, all’s spent, where our desire is got without content. He is condemned by his own ambition, and his only release is to take out his misery on the cat. Most often a dead one. What was most noticeable about this press conference was what was missing. There were no slides on the current R rate, which you’d have imagined was a necessity on the day lockdown was eased. The slide on whether we were actually in stage 3 or 4 of the pandemic had also gone awol. Presumably no one could agree whether we were at 4.01 or 3.99. But hey, we’ve always got pigeon racing and having sex outdoors to cheer us up. All that bullshit about “following the science” was so last month. Instead Matt was happy to announce the government now had the capacity to do 200,000 tests a day – try telling that to my mother’s care home – but was actually only carrying out 128,000. Capacity means rather more to Matt than it does to everyone else. Almost all my school reports insisted I had the capacity to achieve higher grades than I managed. The government certainly had the capacity to handle the pandemic a great deal better than it has done, though that’s one area of capacity Matt is never too keen to explore. “We’re winning the battle,” Matt said hesitantly. “And it’s important to remember we’re all on the same side.” So he wanted everyone to act responsibly, go out there, imagine what Dominic Cummings would have done and then do the exact opposite. If Matt could have ended the briefing there and then he would have done, but sadly he was obliged to take a few questions. All of which he did his best to cut short. A member of the public wanted to know why the advice for shielding vulnerable people had been changed late on Saturday night, despite there being no scientific evidence to justify such a move and without any consultation with GPs. That wasn’t quite true, Hancock said. Doctors and patients had had all of Sunday to work out the best care plan. Why was everyone being so negative about a rushed change of guidelines that could kill thousands?
Things went downhill from there. In response to observations that many of those who had signed up as track and tracers had reported they had been asked to do nothing for days, Matt was insistent this was a sign the new scheme was working brilliantly. This was a cause for celebration. Because if the trackers were working then it would mean there were loads of people with the virus. So the fact that no one had got in touch with so many must mean we were winning the battle. He only wished every tracker had nothing to do. For some reason – probably related to the UK having a higher number of new cases per day than most of the rest of Europe combined – the reporters were not entirely satisfied with this answer. Not least because Matt couldn’t come up with any figures for how many people had been tracked and how many contacts had been traced. “I don’t know,” said Matt irritably. “Though I’m sure it’s the majority.” Yup, me too. It was almost as if the health secretary had no idea whether the very systems on which the easing of lockdown depended actually worked or not. A feeling that was only reinforced when he announced future localised lockdowns would be determined by a Joint Biosecurity Centre that he had already admitted didn’t yet exist. Matt had said too much. He hadn’t said enough. That was him in the corner. That was him in the spotlight."
2020-06-01T18:57:31Z,politics,Politics,Corbyn questions impartiality of body conducting antisemitism inquiry,"Jeremy Corbyn has questioned the impartiality of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which is conducting an inquiry into the Labour party’s handling of antisemitism claims. Speaking to the website Middle East Eye in his first major interview since stepping down as Labour leader, Corbyn accused the EHRC of being “part of the government machine”. His comments come as the equalities watchdog prepares to publish its findings, which are expected to be highly critical of many of Corbyn’s closest allies. He said: “I think it’s quite significant that the Conservative government has underfunded the Equality and Human Rights Commission … and for some reason, which I don’t fully understand … decided to take away its independent status and make it part of the government machine.” Asked if he believed that would affect the outcome of the commission’s report, the Islington North MP said: “Let’s see what happens.” An EHRC spokesperson told Middle East Eye: “We are an independent regulator and take our impartiality very seriously. We have robust procedures and policies in place to manage conflicts of interests or perceived conflicts of interests.” The website only released extracts from the interview on Monday, and will broadcast it in full on Tuesday. Middle East Eye is a London-based online news site founded in 2014 that describes itself as “independently funded”. In 2017 Saudi Arabia claimed that Qatar funded Middle East Eye and demanded the country shut the outlet down as part of a series of sanctions on its neighbour. The site denies receiving funds from Doha. The EHRC launched a formal investigation into Labour a year ago after it received hundreds of complaints about antisemitism in the party. It was only the second such inquiry into a political party by the watchdog, after one into the British National party.
It is seeking to establish whether the party committed unlawful acts and whether it has responded to complaints of unlawful acts in a lawful, efficient and effective manner. Last month the EHRC dropped plans to launch an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservatives after the party set out new details of its own investigation. Classed as a non-departmental public body, the EHRC has had its budget cut by successive Tory-led governments, from £62m in 2010 to £17.4m this year. The commission was reformed during Theresa May’s tenure as home secretary, to “increase its accountability to the government, parliament and the public and to improve its effectiveness and value for money”. Corbyn said if he had become prime minister he would have widened the organisation’s powers and said claims he tolerated antisemitism among his supporters were “wrong and extremely unfair”. He told the website that he had taken steps to create a “robust process” to deal with the claims, describing antisemitism as “absolutely, totally unacceptable in any form”. Asked about a leaked 860-page dossier on Labour’s handling of the issue, Corbyn refused to comment directly but described the party machine at the Southside HQ in London as “leaden-footed”. “I always knew that there was a culture in the Labour party that was not a healthy one, of an almost self-perpetuating bureaucracy,” he said. “I wanted to change the way in which the party operated by changing from being a solely bureaucratic machine that administered the party, disciplined members and observed the rules and so on, into a community-organising base of the party.” Corbyn’s successor, Keir Starmer, has launched an investigation into the leaking of the dossier. A spokesperson for Labour said: “We fully respect the independence of the EHRC. Keir Starmer has made clear he will cooperate fully with the commission’s inquiry. We will implement, in full, any recommendations made by the EHRC.”"

2020-06-01T17:28:48Z,politics,Politics,Rees-Mogg's plans for MPs to vote in person 'beyond a farce',"Government plans to make MPs vote in person during the coronavirus crisis have been condemned as “beyond a farce” amid concerns they will discriminate against shielding politicians and threaten the lives of staff. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, tabled a motion on Monday preventing the resumption of virtual voting, which allowed MPs to have their say from afar during the pandemic. If the house approves the government plan on Tuesday, MPs may have to form kilometre-long queues in order to obey physical distancing rules when voting – despite the Lords planning a move online. The former cabinet minister Karen Bradley is leading a rebellion against the ending of the hybrid Commons proceedings, which allowed for remote voting and virtual debates. Bradley, now the chair of the powerful procedure committee, has put forward amendments which would allow those MPs not able to travel to Westminster to keep participating in debates via video link and to vote remotely. She has the support of the chairs of 16 other select committees including a number of former ministers. Valerie Vaz MP, the shadow leader of the House of Commons, said: “Jacob Rees-Mogg’s discriminatory proposals would result in two classes of MPs. Those who can physically attend and those unable to owing to the government’s own rules, including having an underlying health condition or shielding responsibilities. “The abolition of the hybrid remote parliament which allowed all MPs to take part regardless of their personal circumstances is discriminatory and would not be acceptable in any other workplace.” Rees-Mogg defended the plan in the House political magazine, saying the total numbers on the estate “will not increase significantly”, with MPs’ staff continuing to work from home.“For those MPs with underlying health conditions who have been told to shield or are receiving specific government advice about their health, the government is working with the house authorities to see how they can continue to contribute to proceedings,” he wrote. But the plans, which are still being risk assessed, have drawn criticism from pressure groups and politicians. The Electoral Reform Society said: “If this goes ahead, it is beyond a farce. It is unacceptable when there is currently a safe, secure and speedy option for voting available: remote/digital voting. MPs have already used it, and it works. “Since some MPs are shielding and are not safe to travel in person, these plans – if confirmed – pose a real threat for democratic representation and political equality.” Senior Tories including Robert Halfon, the chair of the Commons education select committee, who is currently shielding, have called for virtual proceedings to continue for those who need them. The Liberal Democrat MP Jamie Stone tweeted: “I’m a carer for my wife. You’re asking me to choose between the health of my family and abiding by your poxy stubbornness. I choose to fulfil my duties as a husband and family man.” Dame Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP for Barking, said she was “furious” that she was being “denied the right to vote” on Tuesday because she was deemed vulnerable. She accused Boris Johnson of being on a “mission to end” digital voting, tweeting: “This damaging move will limit accountability & create a toothless parliament. It means MPs in the ‘vulnerable’ category will be rendered voiceless & it will completely distort votes.” The government’s motion requires voting to take place in person at the Palace of Westminster and that MPs must follow Public Health England guidance. The mechanics of voting would then be left to the Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, to set out, with parliamentarians having to avoid the narrow division lobbies. He has described a single file of MPs snaking through parliament as a “supermarket queue” that will lead through the centre of the chamber to the dispatch box. Unions said the plans will put parliamentary staff at risk from the virus and urged the government to publish any risk assessment of the plans. Amy Leversidge, the FDA union’s assistant general secretary, said Rees-Mogg’s article revealed that “risk assessments are being conducted”. “It is shameful that with less than 24 hours to go the government are still scrambling to work out how parliament can return safely,” she said. The prime minister’s official spokesman said MPs who needed to shield “should continue to do so” and informal arrangements such as pairing would be in place to allow this."
2020-06-01T16:11:18Z,politics,Politics,Advisers urge ministers to review benefit cap in wake of coronavirus,"The government’s own expert welfare advisory group has called on ministers to review the benefit cap, amid evidence that the controversial policy has left tens of thousands of low-income claimants without vital extra financial help during the coronavirus lockdown. A letter to the work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, from the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC) said that although the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had done “remarkable” work to support claimants during the crisis, ministers needed to address several “rough edges” to its policies, including the benefit cap. The SSAC also called for the £90-a-month uprating of universal credit and tax credits announced by the chancellor in March to help with living costs related to Covid-19 to be extended “as soon as possible” to hundreds of thousands of people on older unemployment benefits who did not receive the cash boost. “We are of the strong view that it is increasingly untenable for this group of claimants to be excluded and to continue to have a lower level of income than those in receipt of universal credit and working tax credit,” the committee, which is formally sponsored by the DWP, said. The letter was also critical of DWP advice that left some self-employed people worse off after losing existing benefits in lockdown when they were wrongly told to apply for universal credit as their incomes dropped. Many were refused universal credit, but prevented from reclaiming their original benefits by DWP rules. It comes amid rising concern from charities and opposition parties that policies such as the benefit cap and the two-child benefit limit have left the poorest households struggling to cope with the increased cost of food and energy bills during the pandemic. Estimates suggest that around 108,000 families – including 90,000 families already capped – will not see any of the chancellor’s cash boost because it takes them over the benefit cap limit, enabling the DWP to claw it back. In one case, a capped claimant has taken legal action after she was left worse off by the chancellor’s uprating. The benefit cap was intended to “incentivise” unemployed claimants to get a job by limiting their total household benefits to £23,000 a year (£442 a week) in London and £20,000 a year (£385 a week) outside the capital. People can escape the cap if they get a job or work more hours. The SSAC letter pointed out that this was currently likely to be difficult: “Claimants would normally have the option to move into paid work or to move home to avoid the impact of the benefit cap, but neither of these are realistic choices for many people at the current time.” It said the DWP had claimed it was administratively too difficult to safely uprate jobseeker’s allowance (JSA) and employment and support allowance (ESA). However, ministers should “ensure that this group of claimants … are brought up to the same level as those in receipt of universal credit as soon as it is possible to do so”. Labour’s Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said ministers should heed the committee’s words: “There is no justification for failing to uprate JSA and ESA In line with UC and the benefit cap should be scrapped – it’s clearly impossible to work more hours or move to cheaper housing during the crisis.” The SSAC’s membership includes policy experts from organisations such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, as well as former DWP officials. The DWP said: “We are doing whatever it takes to ensure people are supported through these unprecedented times, including injecting £6.5bn into the welfare system and rolling out income protection schemes, mortgage holidays and additional support for renters. “We have experienced a surge in demand since mid-March and universal credit has enabled us to increase payments at pace, while maintaining the stability of the welfare system overall. We estimate that 2.5 million households on Universal Credit will benefit immediately from the £20-a-week increase in the standard allowance. We have also increased other entitlements such as local housing allowance, to better support those across all benefits.”"
2020-06-01T15:26:03Z,politics,Politics,"EU has no legal duty to give UK trade privileges, document says","The EU has no legal duty to grant the UK privileges offered to other countries in trade deals, an internal European parliament paper has concluded ahead of a crucial round of Brexit talks this week. The document, drawn up by officials for the parliament’s UK coordination group, is a short analysis of arguments made by the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, in a letter to his counterpart, Michel Barnier. Frost accused the EU of treating the UK as an “unworthy” negotiating partner by denying the UK “the kind of well-precedented arrangements commonplace in modern FTAs [free trade agreements]”. EU negotiators were deeply irritated by the letter: they countered that every deal is unique and any agreement with the UK must reflect its proximity and potential to become an economic competitor undercutting European rivals.
While MEPs are not involved in Brexit negotiations, the latest document, seen by the Guardian, underscores that Barnier enjoys the support of the parliament, which must approve the final UK-EU deal. The EU is “not legally obliged to grant to UK the rights or trade preferences agreed with other third countries in past FTAs”, the document states, adding that the EU is sovereign and has “the right to propose the commitments that are in its interest”. The cementing of positions comes before a critical fourth round of negotiations on the future EU-UK relationship starting on Tuesday. EU and British negotiators will meet via video link because of coronavirus restrictions, with talks scheduled on 11 different topics, including trade in goods and police cooperation. The thorny issue of fishing rights has been allocated the most time, amid fading hopes of an agreement by 1 July, a deadline intended to allow the industry time to prepare for changes from 2021. The two sides will also square off over fair competition conditions to access the EU market, an issue known as the level-playing field that is at the heart of the increasingly bitter dispute. EU officials have accused the UK of backsliding on promises made by Boris Johnson last October, while refusing to engage in detailed talks on the issue. British officials reject these charges, while blaming the EU for holding up progress on an area of mutual benefit. British arguments have failed to convince EU diplomats to rewrite Barnier’s mandate, while EU officials have warned of stalemate if this week’s talks fail to progress. Another inconclusive round is likely to set up a difficult encounter between Boris Johnson and the head of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in mid June. The EU is playing down expectations of that meeting, which was once seen as a decisive encounter at the halfway stage of talks. “No one has the interest at the moment to see this as a make-or-break summit, because we know we won’t have enough progress, so we just need to find a common strategy to deal with it,” an EU diplomat said. A UK spokesperson said the government would continue to approach talks constructively. “We expect this round to keep the process on track ahead of the high-level meeting later this month, but it’s clear that the EU needs to evolve its position if we are to reach an agreement. “A balanced solution is needed which reflects the political realities on both sides, and we will continue to make sure our position is understood,” the spokesperson said, adding that the UK would not agree “demands for us to give up our rights as an independent state”."
2020-06-01T13:30:12Z,politics,Politics,Government fails to distance Dominic Cummings from sex discrimination case,"Government lawyers have tried and failed to remove the name of Dominic Cummings from a sex discrimination claim being pursued by Sajid Javid’s former special adviser, the Guardian can disclose. The demand was rejected after barristers for Sonia Khan, the former chancellor’s media adviser who was marched by armed police from Downing Street, successfully argued that the behaviour of Boris Johnson’s chief aide was pivotal to the case. The disclosure will be seen as an attempt by the government to protect Cummings from further controversy. He is facing demands for his resignation after the Guardian revealed that he had driven hundreds of miles across the UK during the coronavirus outbreak. It also means that Cummings could be made personally liable for part of any damages award. Khan was Javid’s media adviser at the time she was escorted from No 10 after Cummings accused her of misleading him over her contact with individuals close to the former chancellor Philip Hammond. She denied any inappropriate contact. Javid was furious to learn about her dismissal after the event.
At an employment tribunal hearing in central London, a judge set the case for a five-day hearing in December at which the relationship between Cummings and Johnson will be scrutinised. Barristers for Khan named Cummings as a respondent in the case, which also includes an unfair dismissal claim. It is understood that the government’s solicitors attempted to argue that his name should be removed and replaced as a respondent with that of the Cabinet Office. Whitehall sources said Cummings planned to fight the claim. Counsel for Khan, who is being backed by the FDA union, argued that Cummings was pivotal to the case and that what he had done personally, rather than just as an agent of the employer, was actionable. He is expected to be summoned as a witness. The hearing ruled that the Cabinet Office could be added as a respondent but Cummings would also remain. Khan, 28, was accused by Cummings of lying about her conversations with Hammond’s former staff member Poppy Trowbridge. It is understood Khan was asked to hand over her work phone, and also presented her personal phone to Cummings. There were no other firsthand witnesses to Khan’s sacking by Cummings, who spoke to her in an office in Downing Street close to the prime minister’s. In a meeting days after Khan’s departure with Boris Johnson’s team of special advisers – known as spads – Cummings is said to have remarked: “If you don’t like how I run things, there’s the door.” Bruce Carr QC, a former government adviser on employment law, said the naming of an individual as a respondent could mean he could be personally liable for damages. “There are plenty of cases where it is appropriate and legitimate to include an individual as a respondent where that individual is central to the allegations of discrimination,” he said. “Where that is or might be the case, it is actually very difficult for the principal respondent such as a government department to persuade a tribunal to strike out a claim against the individual named respondents. “What you are effectively asking them to do is rule that the claim against the individual is frivolous or hopeless or is being brought for illegitimate reasons.” Cummings has previously faced criticism over what some describe as his high-handed behaviour. In 2012, a senior civil servant received a payout of £25,000 from the Department for Education in a bullying case she took against Cummings and a senior member of Michael Gove’s team when Cummings was a special adviser at the department. An internal investigation found no grounds for disciplinary action. Cummings also drew criticism for hiring Andrew Sabisky, a temporary contractor who resigned over comments about eugenics and race. Johnson could also be asked to give evidence to the tribunal. At the time of Khan’s dismissal last September, the terms of employment for special advisers made it clear that it was only the prime minister who had the power to sack them. This was then changed after Khan left, giving Cummings ultimate “responsibility for disciplinary matters”. Dave Penman, the head of the FDA, declined to comment on the specifics of the case. “The FDA continues to support Sonia Khan through her legal claims at tribunal,” he said. A government spokesperson said: “We don’t comment on ongoing legal matters.” A source added that it is standard government practice to ask for the employing department to be named as the respondent rather than individual employees."
2020-05-31T12:28:58Z,politics,Politics,Labour's Rosie Duffield 'right to resign' after lockdown breach,"The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has said her Labour colleague Rosie Duffield had been “absolutely right” to resign from the party’s frontbench for breaching lockdown rules, saying it was vital everyone adhered to them. Duffield, the MP for Canterbury, resigned as a whip and apologised after newspaper revelations that she had met her partner while lockdown restrictions were in place despite not living together. At the time it occurred, people from separate households were still barred from meeting. “She was absolutely right to resign,” Dodds said when asked about the issue on BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show. “Clearly, she wasn’t right to have broken the rules, quite the opposite. “It’s absolutely correct that she has immediately taken responsibility for that, as I understand it, and she has resigned. I talk to my constituents and the kind of sacrifices they have gone through to stick to the rules, to keep us all safe. Everybody has got to do that.” While Dodds did not mention Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, who has not resigned despite apparently breaching lockdown rules to drive from London to Durham with his family, Labour will have been keen to show a very different approach to such issues. Duffield quit her role before publication of the story in the Mail on Sunday, which said she had gone for a walk in April with James Routh, who was separating from his wife. He also visited her constituency home. He now lives at her London flat, the paper said. The MP said they observed physical distancing rules by keeping two metres away but accepted this was before such meetings were allowed. In a statement she said: “My partner and I have been attempting to navigate a difficult personal situation as responsibly as possible. I apologise that during that process, we breached the guidelines. “A relationship breakdown is difficult at the best of times, let alone during a pandemic. I hope people can understand why I took the steps I did and know that I take responsibility for the breaches that occurred and for which I apologise.” Duffield took Canterbury from the Conservatives in the 2017 election with a majority of 187, increasing this to 1,836 in December’s election. In October, she won considerable praise for using a debate on the domestic abuse bill to chronicle her experiences at the hands of a previous partner who became controlling and threatening."
2020-05-31T07:35:06Z,politics,Politics,MPs furious about forced return of ‘physical voting’ to Commons,"Senior MPs have warned that many elderly members of parliament and those with health conditions will be “disenfranchised” and put at risk of contracting Covid-19 if they are forced back to the House of Commons for debates and votes this week. A furious argument has broken out between backbench MPs of all parties and the government over plans which, if passed, will end all remote voting from this week and mean members have to attend in person. Parliament is resuming on Tuesday with the row still unresolved. One former cabinet minister predicted “total chaos” if leader of the house Jacob Rees-Mogg presses ahead with the plan and insists on a policy of “physical voting” only in the chamber. Many MPs say the rules will mean they have to break the law by travelling to parliament and staying overnight in shared accommodation when they could easily work from home. On Friday evening, the all-party House of Commons procedure committee recommended that the remote voting system should be allowed to continue, to protect the ability of MPs who are self-isolating, shielding, or otherwise vulnerable to represent constituents. The Tory chair of the committee, Karen Bradley, said members would effectively be “disenfranchised” if the hybrid system was abandoned. On the issue of voting, the committee recommended that “the house will as far as possible allow virtual participation in its proceedings by members who, by virtue of the coronavirus pandemic, are prevented from attending the house in person”. A Commons vote on how to proceed will be held on Tuesday, with many MPs now torn over whether to attend. Under the Rees-Mogg plan, MPs would have to queue around the palace of Westminster to vote because doing so in the cramped lobbies has been declared unsafe. Former shadow leader of the house Chris Bryant said the queues “would be like Alton Towers”. Some MPs believe Rees-Mogg wants to recall parliament in full physical form to bolster prime minister Boris Johnson, who prefers a loud group of Tory MPs to be cheering him on. But any hope of a full chamber returning was thwarted when the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, insisted on retaining a rule that a maximum of only 50 MPs could be in the chamber at any one time.
Veteran Labour MP and former minister Margaret Hodge, 75, said she had been told by lawyers that the government would be breaking several laws passed by parliament if it denied MPs the right to vote. “I regard myself as fairly fit but even so I feel absolutely furious that MPs who cannot go to parliament are being discriminated against and denied the right to vote on behalf of our constituents in parliament. “The informal legal advice I have had suggests that acting in this way would break three different types of legislation regarding healthy and safety, equalities and human rights. It beggars belief that we think we can be above the laws we make.” Former Labour foreign secretary Margaret Beckett, 77, whose husband Leo is 93, said she believed the “hybrid” system used earlier this month – under which MPs could vote either in person when attending parliament or remotely from home – had worked well. Insisting that MPs return to Westminster to debate and vote would, she said, go against the national guidance on coronavirus and could put MPs’ health and that of their families at risk. “I thought the guidance was that if you could work from home you should do so. I think what they are doing is a very high-risk strategy,” she said. Other MPs with constituencies outside London and the south-east are complaining that forcing them back to Westminster will mean they will have no option but to move back into houses and flats they share with other MPs in London when they are attending parliament. The Labour MP for Manchester Central, Lucy Powell, said: “The parliamentary estate can adapt like other workplaces, albeit with challenges. However, what contravenes government rules is that most of us would need to stay in our second homes, which many of us share with other MPs, so mixing households and travelling hundreds of miles to get there. We can’t enforce rules that as lawmakers we are breaking ourselves. This will send a very confused message to the public.”"
2020-05-30T23:01:55Z,politics,Politics,Key election battlegrounds face double hit from Brexit and coronavirus,"Key English election battlegrounds in the north-west and Midlands will be severely exposed to a double economic hit from Brexit and coronavirus should the UK fail to secure an EU trade deal by the end of the year, new analysis has warned. Boris Johnson has continued to rule out any extension to Britain’s EU transition deal, which expires from January. It comes despite a deadlock in talks about a future trade deal, before the final round of talks this week. However, an impact assessment of ending the transition period found that manufacturing, banking, finance and insurance sectors would be “severely exposed” to a double economic hit from Brexit and coronavirus. The Social Market Foundation analysis divided the country into areas and then placed each in a category between 1 and 5, with 5 representing those most exposed to a double hit. Half of those in the north-west are in category 5 and a further 40% in category 4. It said that the West Midlands, where the Tories made major gains in last year’s election, was also exposed. There have already been warnings that new border arrangements in the Irish Sea will not be ready by Johnson’s end-of-year deadline, but Downing Street is adamant that the transition period, which gives Britain access to the EU’s single market, will not be extended. James Kirkup, the SMF director, said: “In some cases and some places, that double impact will be severe. At base, this report demonstrates the simple fact that leaving a developed free-trade agreement with our nearest and largest trading partners at the same time as facing a pandemic will expose many local areas of the UK to a painful double economic impact.” The study was funded by Best for Britain, which is campaigning for a comprehensive EU trade deal. Naomi Smith, its chief executive, said: “This report, which maps the impact of both shocks, definitively rebuts any speculation that the impact of leaving the transition period could be masked by the coronavirus recession. The data is clear: when you scratch beneath the surface, so many key sectors will be exposed to a dangerous double whammy of economic hits.”"
2020-05-30T22:47:18Z,politics,Politics,John Bercow will not get peerage despite Corbyn nomination,"John Bercow will not be awarded a peerage despite being nominated by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, it has been reported. The nomination of the former Speaker of the House of Commons will not be passed on to the Queen for approval because he is the subject of an investigation into alleged wrongdoing and will not pass a “propriety test” unless he is cleared before the nominations are sent. The investigation, into claims that he “bullied” staff that worked for him, has not yet been completed. Former senior parliamentary official Lt General David Leakey is among the complainants. Leakey, who served as Black Rod, accused Bercow of “intolerable rudeness and explosive behaviour” in a report passed to the parliamentary commissioner for standards. Bercow has said he categorically denies “I have ever bullied anyone, anywhere at any time”. Corbyn nominated Bercow for a peerage in his dissolution honours list after he became the first Speaker in more than two centuries to step down and not be nominated for the Lords by the government. His handling of issues around Brexit and other parliamentary business allegedly made him a target for many pro-Brexit figures who are now in power.
A book published this month claimed that Bercow frequently clashed with parliamentary staff who he believed were opposing reforms to improve facilities and services to MPs and the public. Critics claimed his portrayal of parliamentary clerks as “fuddy-duddy old farts who block everything is a very convenient fiction for him”. Bercow was contacted for comment on Saturday night. A second Corbyn peerage nomination has also been refused, the Sunday Times reported. Karie Murphy, a former nurse, ran the Labour leader’s office and also organised the party’s ill-fated 2019 election campaign. Corbyn faced criticism for nominating her from members of his own party while it was still under investigation over its handling of antisemitism. Murphy is named in submissions to the Equality and Human Rights Commission but has denied any wrongdoing."
2020-05-30T20:25:52Z,politics,Politics,From rose garden to ridicule:  how a week of disaster for Tories and Dominic Cummings unfolded,"As she looked out of her kitchen window towards a farm in the distance owned by Dominic Cummings’ parents, an elderly woman described her reaction on Friday to the story that had caused shock not just in rural County Durham, but across the whole country. “I have isolated for 10 weeks. I have not seen my children since before Christmas,” said the woman, who asked not to be named. She lives in a pretty village across the valley, with a pond and village green, where life normally passes quietly by with few disturbances. Over the past week, however, the peace has been broken and feelings have run high. “If there were stocks in the village, Dominic Cummings would be in them,” she said. “There is not one single person around here who is not disgusted. Everyone is furious because we have all played fair. People haven’t been able to go to funerals, they haven’t been able to go to weddings, they haven’t been able to look after people who are dying.
“I can’t go to see my friend in Barnard Castle who is dying and yet that four-letter word goes out for a trip. “I was born in this county. I have never come across ill-feeling like this about anything. Everyone feels it is one law for us and one law for them. That is so unfair.” It is now eight days since the Guardian and Daily Mirror broke the story of Dominic Cummings’ 264-mile journey with his wife and child from London to his parents’ home at the height of the lockdown, and much as Downing Street would love it to, the story is not going away. Last Sunday – as the controversy began to dominate the news – the prime minister insisted that his most trusted and powerful adviser had done nothing wrong, either by travelling north or, when he was there, by taking a 60-mile round trip in the family car to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight on his wife’s birthday. Boris Johnson’s defence of Cummings – when the evidence against him seems so clear to everyone – has angered and appalled not only the public at large, but also Tory MPs and the Tory press in equal measure. The normally loyal Daily Mail reacted on Monday with an outraged front page headline next to photos of Cummings and Johnson, asking What Planet Are They On? That same afternoon Cummings attempted an explanation in front of the cameras, portraying himself as a normal responsible dad who had left London because he was worried about his son. During an extraordinary appearance in the Downing Street rose garden – normally reserved for the most important visitors – the man Johnson dare not sack was, however, completely unrepentant. He would not resign, he said, and had not at any point thought of doing so. In response, MPs of all parties reported that anger from voters had been turned up to boiling point. And more media scorn poured down on the PM and his adviser. Proving that the story had dangerous levels of cut-though, even for a governing party with a large majority, the Daily Star broke its rule of ignoring politics on its front page by printing a cut-out mask of Cummings’ face with the words: Do whatever the hell you want and sod everybody else mask. As the prime minister tries this weekend to get the country to “move on” from the Cummings row – and focus on his new track-and-trace plan to defeat coronavirus, while easing the lockdown slowly at the same time – that Daily Star front page precisely encapsulates his problem.
As one despairing Tory MP put it: “We can say move on and we can say let’s tackle Covid-19 together. But by staking everything on saving Dominic Cummings, we have lost the trust we desperately need to do exactly that. How can we ask people to obey lockdown rules when those at the top are seen to be doing as they want and are not obeying rules? The awful thing is that I think the damage is done.” All last week the inboxes of Tory MPs were full to overflowing with emails from incredulous voters who could see the glaring contradiction in Johnson’s and his government’s position. In the same press conferences, the health Secretary Matt Hancock was earnestly telling people it was their “civic duty” to self-isolate under the newly launched track-and-trace system if they had been near someone infected with Covid-19, while in the next breath defending Cummings for having done nothing wrong. “It is a complete disaster. It is not just about rule-breaking, it is the glaring contradictions that make nonsense of messages because Cummings is still in there,” said another senior Tory. More than 100 Conservative members of parliament, afraid that they will never be forgiven by their electorates unless they condemn Cummings publicly, have now chosen to criticise him, risking the prime minister’s wrath. The pressure on the prime minister will only mount further. Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, has already relayed the extent of anger on the Conservative benches to Downing Street. But this week, the 1922 will meet after MPs return to parliament, and the issue is expected to dominate everything. Some Conservatives are doing their best to cool the controversy. Charles Walker, vice-chair of the 1922 Committee, accepts that many are furious, but says there will be more important issues over which the government will have confront the people in months and years to come. “If people are very angry at the actions of Dominic Cummings, then that anger is probably only a harbinger of the greater rage to come when the forthcoming recession, or heaven forbid depression, starts to bite,” Walker says. “Then the actions of a worried father will be secondary to the reality of lost businesses, jobs and homes.” Other Conservatives vainly try to claim the fuss is being whipped up by bitter and twisted leftwing and liberal Remainers who want revenge on Cummings for delivering Brexit for Johnson. But saying that it is all politically motivated does not fit with the evidence, and most Tories know that. Our Opinium poll today shows that 81% of all voters think Cummings broke the rules, and that 52% of Tory supporters think he should resign. Almost half of 2019 Tory voters say their respect for the government they voted in has been reduced by the Cummings fiasco. Writing in today’s Observer the Tory hardline Brexiter Peter Bone calls again for Cummings to go and dismisses the idea that it is Remainers stirring trouble. “The saga is now preventing the government from being able to get their message out clearly,” he writes. “Every announcement on changes to the lockdown rules, track and trace, and government support, is bogged down with questions about Mr Cummings.” Bone adds: “I believe that Mr Cummings did break the rules. Now, if he had accepted that he had done something wrong, and apologised for it, as a fair-minded person, I would have thought that that would be the end of it. It is the insistence that he did not break the rules and the refusal to apologise that has outraged so many.” On Thursday, as Johnson tried desperately to take stories about Dominic Cummings off the front pages and news bulletins, he announced his plans to ease the lockdown by allowing up to six people to meet outside or in each others’ gardens. They could enjoy barbecues together in the hot weather, he said. The announcement surprised many at high levels of government as they had not expected the loosening to be confirmed so soon. Some suspected it had been brought forward to distract from the Cummings row. Now Johnson is facing new criticism for easing the lockdown too soon and risking a second wave of infections. As The Observer reports today, a group of 27 leading public health experts is warning that his refusal to sack Cummings, and his reliance on systems for track and trace that may not be ready, is a dangerous combination that has seriously undermined trust in government.
Other scientists add that the Cummings affair has blown a hole in the government’s messaging. Shona Hilton, professor of public health policy at the University of Glasgow, said: “In the weeks and months ahead, communicating the easing of lockdown restrictions is going to be a significant challenge requiring public trust in our leaders. This incident will make this challenge even harder for the government to clearly communicate and explain these rules. Politicians should not underestimate this challenge or take public support for granted.” Stephen Griffin, a virologist and associate professor at Leeds University, agreed: “There has only been a very gradual decline in numbers of new cases of Covid-19 being reported each day. We are still getting them in their thousands and it is going to be very hard to test and trace new cases in those sorts of numbers. The margin for error is going to be very slight. And then Cummings does this. It was shocking. The message that we should just move on is not correct. We need to be led by example and not by allowing exceptions like this.” Meanwhile, the Tories are falling fast in the polls. Their lead stood at 26 points over Labour at the end of March but is now down to four points. On Friday, a petition calling for Cummings to be sacked had gained over one million signatures. Our poll today shows 68% of people think he should resign and if he doesn’t 66% want Johnson to sack him. On Monday, Johnson said he had made clear his position on his adviser and that it was now up to the public to decide its view. It seems the public has now done so but, as yet, there is no sign the prime minister is listening."
2020-05-30T19:30:51Z,politics,Politics,"Dominic Cummings has broken Covid-19 policy trust, say top scientists","Britain’s top public health leaders and scientists have warned Boris Johnson that trust in the government has been shattered by the Dominic Cummings affair and now poses real danger to life when lockdown measures are lifted this week. In a letter sent to No 10 on Friday, 26 senior UK academics and health administrators warn that public faith in the government is essential if the Covid-19 crisis is to be tackled effectively. However, they make clear that trust has been “badly damaged by the recently reported actions of Dominic Cummings, including his failure to stand down or resign in the public interest”, and by the prime minister’s refusal to dismiss him. In their extraordinary intervention, published in full in the Observer, the group also warns there has been a failure to set up an effective test, trace and isolate system to pinpoint and then quarantine newly infected people. As a result, they are now “very concerned for the safety and wellbeing of the general public” as the lockdown measures are relaxed.
The warnings came as the government’s deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam went out of his way at the daily coronavirus briefing to make clear that people in positions of authority had a duty to lead by example and obey lockdown rules. In the clearest criticism yet by a top government figure of Cummings’ actions in driving with his wife and child from London to Durham in late March, Van-Tam said: “In my opinion the rules are clear and have always been clear. In my opinion they are for the benefit of all and they apply to all.” An Opinium poll for the Observer shows 81% of people believe Cummings broke the rules, and 68% think he should resign, including 52% of Conservative supporters. The poll, conducted on Thursday and Friday, also shows the Conservatives’ lead over Labour has crashed from 26 points at the end of March to just four points now. Last week alone the lead was cut from 12 to four points.
Just days after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, unveiled the new test, trace and isolate scheme to combat Covid-19, the top health experts say the public mood is “too fragile to cope with another over-optimistic target-based strategy”, and urge transparency over timescales and risks for the national scheme. They say people need “to see with their own eyes that the necessary infrastructure and effective systems are put in place not just rapidly, but effectively”. They also say there is now a high risk of an uncontrolled spike in new infections, hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 over the summer.
One of the letter’s main authors, Prof David McCoy, director of the centre for public health at Queen Mary University, London, described the test, trace and isolate system – which aims to quarantine people with Covid-19 and those who have been in contact with them – as “a mess”. “It is not a system,” he told the Observer. “It is just a fragmented collection of different programmes with nothing really holding them together. We needed to have spent much of April organising the test and trace programme and that was not done. We have wasted the time we had bought ourselves.” Part of that failure could be blamed on Dominic Cummings, he added. “Firstly he breached the lockdown rules but also as the chief adviser to the prime minister he has to take some responsibility for the failure of the government to make a proper response to Covid.”
These experts’ concerns were also shared by other scientists who worry that daily rates of new cases are still too high to make test and tracing programmes feasible. Current infection rates suggest tracking operations will be quickly overwhelmed, they say. “The total number of cases a day is still substantial and there is evidence of decreasing compliance to restrictions and people moving farther away from their homes, increasing the chance of spread to previously unaffected areas,” said Prof Rowland Kao, at Edinburgh University. On Saturday night Rosie Duffield, MP for Canterbury, said she no longer a Labour whip after she met her partner while they were living separately, in breach of coronavirus restrictions. She met him for a walk when meetings of people from different households were not allowed. “My partner and I have been attempting to navigate a difficult personal situation as responsibly as possible. I apologise that during that process, we breached the guidelines,” she said. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, on Saturday announced plans to re-start competitive sport as the government maintained momentum towards easing the lockdown. Johnson has said that from Monday up to six people from different households can gather outdoors, including in gardens and for barbecues, so long as they keep 2 metres apart. Prof Devi Sridhar, also at Edinburgh University, said the current daily rate of thousands of new cases was unacceptably high. “Watching carefully what’s happening in east Asia and combining this with what we know so far about this virus, it does indeed feel like mistakes are being repeated,” she said. Daily new cases should be cut to double digits, or low hundreds at most, she said, while test, trace and isolate procedures are put in place and core infrastructure built up. Graham Medley, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and a member of the government’s Sage scientific advisory group, agreed that the UK was taking a risk over the loosening of lockdown because of its current relatively high incidence of infections. “There is less room for mistakes,” he added. “The precautionary principle suggests that if you are unsure about the risks, especially when the outcomes have a large impact, then you should err on the side of caution.” Four other members of the Sage committee, Prof John Edmunds, Sir Jeremy Farrar, Prof Calum Semple and Prof Peter Horby, all warned on Saturday that the government was taking a serious risk by easing the lockdown while 8,000 people a day were being infected. The number of people who have died from Covid-19 in all settings rose on Saturday by 215 to 38,376. A further 2,445 people tested positive for the virus."
2020-05-30T19:30:51Z,politics,Politics,Tory poll lead collapses as voters say Cummings should go,"Boris Johnson is under fresh pressure to sack Dominic Cummings as a new poll shows that more than two-thirds of voters – including more than half of Tories – want him thrown out of Downing Street for breaching lockdown rules. The survey by Opinium for the Observer shows a massive 81% think Cummings broke the rules. It also finds that support for the Conservatives is collapsing, with the party now just four points ahead of Labour, having had a commanding lead of 26 points just two months ago. In the past week alone, the Tory lead has fallen by eight points, the largest weekly drop Opinium has recorded since 2017. After several days in which the news has been dominated by the row over Cummings’ trip from London to Durham with his wife and child, and his refusal to apologise, public anger is laid bare by the poll. Some 68% think Cummings should resign. If he does not, 66% believe he should be sacked by Johnson. As he stood by his adviser, Johnson said he would ultimately leave the public to make up their minds. The poll, and a petition calling for Cummings to be dismissed that has attracted over a million signatures, show where the balance of opinion lies.
Johnson also tried to blame the media for the story. But the poll finds that only 29% of people believe journalists have been unfair to Cummings. By contrast, 67% do not believe Cummings’ explanation of what happened, spelt out in his unapologetic appearance in the Downing Street rose garden last week. People are particularly sceptical about the reasons he gave for a trip to Barnard Castle on 12 April after recovering from illness, with 72% saying they do not believe that he wanted a trial drive to see if his eyesight was good enough for the 250-mile trip back to London. Just over half (52%) think Cummings’ actions will have damaged the fight against coronavirus, as the government tries to launch the track and trace system.
Opinium conducted its survey on Thursday and Friday after Johnson said he believed it was time for the country to “move on” from the the controversy: 41% agreed that the country should now “move on”, but a large minority (37%) said it should not – including almost a fifth (18%) of 2019 Conservative voters. Two-thirds (65%) said they believed Johnson was wrong to be still supporting Cummings – including almost half (48%) of 2019 Conservative voters. Just over two in five (43%) UK adults said they had lost respect for the government over its backing of Cummings – of which 45% voted Conservative in 2019. The Tory lead of 4 points is the lowest since Johnson became prime minister. The Tories are down four points on last week, to 43% (two points below their figure at the general election). Labour is up 4 points, to 39%."
2020-05-30T12:25:43Z,politics,Politics,'No faith in our leaders': lockdown diaries reveal anger over Cummings,"The Westminster village often gets over-excited about news that, frankly, passes the ordinary voter by. What happens there can seem to have little relevance to people’s lives. But, according to BritainThinks’ coronavirus diaries, the Dominic Cummings story unearthed by the Guardian/Mirror investigation is different. Our diarists, 50 people from all walks of life, are keeping weekly accounts of their lives in lockdown. They were clear that this news from Westminster matters. Entries from last weekend were dominated by Cummings, the chief adviser to Boris Johnson, and his trip to Durham. The mood is febrile. We’ve been asking people to sum up their feelings in a word or two. Back at the start, nine weeks ago, the diarists were “worried”. They then grew “bored” and “frustrated” as lockdown wore on. As the government message, at first so unifying, became bewilderingly unclear, many declared themselves “confused”. Now they are quite simply angry. This anger has been bubbling under the surface for a while. At a difficult time, many have judged and been judged by neighbours and friends as they have grappled with “doing the right thing”. Everyone has a tale to tell about someone getting it wrong. It hits home hard because everyone also has a tale to tell of self-sacrifice, of hardship, even heartbreak. It’s an emotional rollercoaster. Many feel their lives are out of control. Cummings and, indirectly, Johnson have become lightning rods for those feelings, fuelling indignation about people who don’t or won’t play by the rules. In polling last week, 71% of respondents agreed “there is one rule for them [the government] and another rule for everyone else”. This fury about being played by an elite when at your most powerless and vulnerable is, ironically, felt most strongly by the very people to whom Cummings’ brilliant “take back control” Brexit message had appealed most. The implications for the government’s reputation have the potential to be far-reaching. Here’s a flavour of the diaries: “Dominic Cummings’ actions make a mockery of all those people, most of them much less privileged than he is, who have suffered during isolation.” “Oh, the hypocrisy of politicians. They make the rules, then undermine them and make them useless.” “It’s one rule for the nation but Cummings can do what he wants.” “I now have no faith in our leaders. They are playing games with politics, playing with us.” “Joe Public would never get the backing from on high that Dominic Cummings has had. Joe Public would be fined.” “It makes me so angry … surely the government’s top adviser can arrange his own food and childcare in London without travelling from the country’s main virus hotspot to another region.” “I’m so upset at Cummings blatantly breaking the lock down rules – and at the senior Conservatives lining up to defend him.” “BoJo – what is he doing standing by DC and his Tour of Britain, while the rest of us stayed home?” “I think at the beginning they seemed quite impressive and I had a lot of faith in them. I thought they were different. But now they’ve made a huge amount of errors. Just like the others.” Deborah Mattinson is founder director of the research and strategy consultancy BritainThinks"
2020-05-30T08:36:22Z,politics,Politics,Call for inquiry into why senior Tory helped donor avoid £40m tax,"Labour has urged the Cabinet Office to investigate why the housing secretary intervened in a controversial London planning decision that could have saved a Conservative party donor tens of millions of pounds. Robert Jenrick, the housing, communities and local government secretary, knew that the former media tycoon Richard Desmond had only 24 hours to have an East End property development approved before hefty community charges were imposed on the billionaire’s project. The imposition of Tower Hamlets council’s community infrastructure levy (CIL) would have cost Desmond at least £40m. Jenrick later accepted that approval of the Isle of Dogs project was unlawful. In a letter to the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, the shadow housing and planning minister, Mike Amesbury, said Jenrick’s decision to back the proposed development was “deeply concerning” and that the Cabinet Office should fully investigate the matter. “Serious questions need to be answered about why this decision was taken, a decision which could have saved a Conservative donor tens of millions of pounds, and in the process deprived local residents of vital infrastructure funding,” he wrote. “It’s essential that we have transparency in processes such as this so that trust can be maintained in our housing and planning system. “I hope the Cabinet Office will uphold this spirit of transparency, do the right thing and conduct a thorough investigation into the events around this decision.” Documents disclosed earlier this week from the consent order for the development showed Jenrick was aware that the council-imposed CIL would have been introduced on 15 January this year. Against the advice of his own planning inspector, he gave the go-ahead for the construction of more than 1,500 apartments in a 44-storey complex on 14 January. CILs were to be used to tax large property developments at £280 per sq metre, with the money raised being used to build schools and health clinics in the council area. Point 4 of the consent order relating to the project states: “In pre-action correspondence, pursuant to the duty of candour, the first defendant explained the DL (decision letter) was issued on 14 January 2020 so that it would be issued before the claimant (Tower Hamlets) adopt its new local plan and CIL charging schedule.” Tower Hamlets council took legal action against Jenrick, claiming the timing of his decision appeared to show bias towards the former owner of the Daily Star, Daily Express and Sunday Express. The council asked the court to order the government to disclose all correspondence between the housing secretary and government officials about the decision. Jenrick accepted his decision did show “apparent bias” and recused himself from any future decisions over Desmond’s planned residential project on the site of the old Westferrry Road printworks. One of those who had raised objections to the project was the ministry’s own planning inspection officer, who said the development would damage views of Tower Bridge. Desmond sold his Express and Star titles two years ago. The 68-year-old’s company Northern & Shell, which is behind the Isle of Dogs development, donated £10,000 to the Conservatives in 2017 and £1m to Ukip in 2015."
2020-05-29T19:42:36Z,politics,Politics,"Constituents v Cummings: 'Just three emails, from hundreds, were in support of him'","An MP’s office is a busy place at the best of times. As soon as Olivia was elected in the early hours of Friday 13 December, people began reaching out to her. Forty-eight hours later, as she made her first trip from Sheffield down to Westminster as a new MP, her inbox and parliamentary postbags were already filling up. Strip away all the traffic generated by parliamentary business in Westminster and what remains is the precious correspondence from an MP’s constituents. Since the election we’ve received well over 5,000 contacts by email, phone and post. Each separate issue raised by a constituent – which can be several letters or emails – is organised as a case. By the end of March, we had opened 1,147 cases, or 328 a month. During April, this case rate tripled. We opened 1,117 new cases as the Covid-19 crisis took hold. People got in touch about food support, the furlough scheme, small business loans, PPE, testing, and for help to get stranded loved ones home from overseas. Through May, things had settled down a little. That was until the Dominic Cummings story. Late on Saturday evening, emails with subject lines “Dominic Cummings”, “Johnson and Cummings” and “Outraged” began appearing faster than we could clear them. By Monday our inbox was overwhelmed, and we’d received so many emails with the subject line “Dominic Cummings” that the parliamentary spam filter had incorrectly started to classify them as spam. An MP can only represent his or her own constituents, so we are set up to match names and addresses against the electoral roll – these are real people. My previous life was as a data scientist, and the urge to quantify what we were seeing was instinctive. Graphing the average (three-hourly) case load, the intensity is drastic. In the past few days we have regularly experienced rates well above 10 times the baseline, and that in already busy times.
The first spike corresponds to the immediate hours following Johnson’s press conference on the evening of 24 May. The following day, on Monday 25, this built again and culminated in a second spike through the immediate build-up and aftermath of Cummings’ rose garden address. Things have showed little signs of abating in subsequent days, either. Graphing cumulative case loads, the impact appears equally drastic. Without the Cummings story, we were on track for around 450 cases in May. In just five days, a single issue in itself will have not far off doubled our case load for the entire month. That is, of course, not to mention the strength of feeling. So many people had their own stories of suffering. Many started by saying it was the first time they had written to their MP. Every single email was written personally. For all Boris Johnson’s insistence that Cummings had relied on his “instinct” as a father, so many instinctively felt what he had done was wrong. In fact, just three people came out in support.
Counting the cases gives a real sense of the scale of people’s feeling. The content, of course, must be read carefully and acted upon by an MP and their team. When things settle and time permits, data scientists may well measure the sentiment contained within the unstructured text data itself – analysing the frequency of words such as “disgusted” and “outraged”. I’m certain they’ll find it’s off the charts. • The final graph in this article was amended on 1 June 2020 to correct an error in the labelling."
2020-05-29T18:39:34Z,politics,Politics,Durham police facing possible inquiry into handling of Cummings case,"Durham police is facing a possible inquiry into its handling of the Dominic Cummings saga after complaints were passed to its internal investigation team. The force has received a number of complaints from members of the public angry at the way it dealt with Boris Johnson’s aide over his travels during lockdown. It is understood the messages have been passed to the force’s professional standards department which is assessing whether to take matters further. The force, one of the smallest in Britain, was thrust into the spotlight when the Guardian and Mirror revealed a week ago that Cummings drove 260 miles from London to his family property in Durham then made a second trip to a local beauty spot. Following an investigation this week, Durham police said it believed the special adviser probably did break lockdown rules by embarking on a 52-mile round trip to the town of Barnard Castle with his wife and son on her birthday. Officers might have intervened to send him home had they caught him on the trip on 12 April, or fined him if he refused, the report said. Its investigation also concluded that Cummings did not break health protection regulations by making the 260-mile trip to Durham with his son and wife, who had coronavirus symptoms, though it made no finding in relation to the “stay at home” government guidance. The force’s findings have been met with anger in some quarters, prompting several emailed complaints which were then passed on to its professional standards department as is protocol. The complaints were first revealed by the Telegraph on Friday. The nature of the complaints is not known. The force’s findings published on Thursday prompted anger both from people who believe Cummings did break the law and those who believe the force should never have retrospectively investigated the matter. A Durham constabulary spokesman said: “There is currently no investigation into the force’s handling of this inquiry.” The professional standards department could decide to take matters further if it believes there is enough evidence to warrant a misconduct investigation. Such investigations have the authority to seize documents, interview witnesses and even arrest serving police officers. A spokeswoman for the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said no referral had been made to it from Durham police and therefore it was not conducting any investigation. Cummings has denied any wrongdoing and said the journey to Barnard Castle on 12 April, Easter Sunday, was to test his eyesight. The prime minister and cabinet continued to stand by him on Friday."
2020-05-29T17:07:44Z,politics,Politics,Chancellor takes a softly-softly approach to easing Covid-19 crisis support,"Paying workers up to £2,500 a month to kick their heels at home doesn’t come cheap. The cost to the exchequer of paying 80% of the wage bill for furloughed staff is one of the factors likely to push state borrowing to record peacetime levels this year. Yet getting shot of the scheme is proving mighty hard for the government. Speculation that Rishi Sunak would make companies pay 20% of the wages of furloughed employees from August proved to be wide of the mark. Instead, the chancellor has opted for a much more cautious, step-by-step approach, and at the same time extended support to the self-employed for a further three months. The two measures speak volumes about his view of Britain’s likely pace of recovery from the Covid-19 lockdown. Originally, both the furlough and the self-employed schemes were meant to last for three months. Now the former runs until the end of October, the latter until August. Clearly, Sunak thinks recovery will be long and hard. There will be no rapid snap back in activity, no V-shaped recession. Instead, companies that are only slowly returning to normal will be given the flexibility to allow furloughed employees to come back to work, even if it is for just one day a week or a few hours a day. The downside of this flexibility is the risk of fraud: firms claiming staff are furloughed when they are working. But this was just one of the tough choices Sunak had to make. On the one hand, he didn’t want to make the scheme so generous that firms would continue furloughing workers for longer than they needed too. On the other hand, he knows that there are some extremely vulnerable sectors of the economy, such as hospitality, that would find it impossible to pay anything like 20% of the wage bill in current circumstances. The fear was that if these firms were asked to pay too much too quickly there would be a massive surge in unemployment over the coming months. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has estimated there were 2.5 million people employed in the hardest hit sectors of the economy. Adding them all to the dole queues would leave official unemployment nudging 5 million. Once the chancellor decided against a sector-by-sector approach he had little choice but to crank up employer contributions slowly. He has decided that all firms will need to start paying something from the start of August, whether they are open or not. As things stand, it doesn’t look as if many consumer-facing businesses in the retailing and hospitality sectors will be fully out of lockdown by then, but they will still be expected to pay employer national insurance contributions and pension contributions for furloughed workers.
The Treasury pointed out that these amount to a fraction – about 5% – of the gross employment costs the employer would have faced had the furlough scheme not been in place. In September the Treasury will pay 70% of a furloughed workers wages and in October – the last month of the scheme – it will pay 60%. Once NICs and pension contributions are included, employers will pay 14% of gross employment costs in September and 23% in October. Yet the Office for National Statistics reported this week that 58% of firms that had paused trading had cash reserves of less than six months, and 7% had no reserves at all. Many of these businesses were operating on wafer-thin margins even before Covid-19, and they will find it even tougher to make money with social distancing rules in place. Even finding 5% might be enough to tip plenty of them over the edge."
2020-05-29T17:00:19Z,politics,Politics,Constituents bombard MPs with tens of thousands of emails over Dominic Cummings,"The furore over Dominic Cummings’ breach of lockdown rules has prompted tens of thousands of people to flood their MPs’ inboxes in what some described as the biggest outpouring since Brexit, a Guardian analysis has found. As Boris Johnson tried to draw a line under the crisis involving his chief adviser, constituents across the country sent missives to their MPs, with many sharing stories of their own lockdown hardships.
A Guardian analysis covering 117 MPs found they have received a total of 31,738 emails since a joint Guardian and Daily Mirror investigation a week ago divulged that Cummings had travelled to County Durham and taken a trip to a beauty spot with his family after suffering coronavirus symptoms. If that level of correspondence was reflected across all 650 MPs, it would suggest the revelations may have sparked as many as 180,000 items of correspondence. The numbers were either provided in response to the Guardian’s request for figures, or in statements MPs had released to constituents. Johnson has repeatedly suggested it was time to “move on” from the Cummings row, despite about half of Tory backbenchers – more than 100 MPs – calling for his most senior aide to resign or be sacked, or criticising Cummings. Many said they were motivated by their constituents’ anger. On Friday evening Theresa May added her voice to the Tories criticising Cummings. In a statement to constituents of her Maidenhead seat, the former prime minister said she could “well understand the [public’s] anger” towards Johnson’s senior adviser. “I do not feel that Mr Cummings followed the spirit of the guidance,” she said.
Several Conservative MPs in marginal seats said they had received more than 1,000 emails about Cummings, in some cases dwarfing their majority. While the average number of emails each MP got was 271, the Tory MPs analysed by the Guardian received 590 each on average. Many MPs said the emails were from people writing to them for the first time and not the common copy-and-paste messages on a campaigning issue, and for some it has been the most significant volume since the Brexit crisis in parliament. Sir Roger Gale, Conservative MP for North Thanet, who was among the first to say Cummings’ job was no longer tenable, said: “I’ve had between 700 and 800 emails, and half of those are constituents, half of those are from other people. About 85% are critical [of him], and 15% think I’m the devil incarnate. “Not one has been computer-generated, they are all individual observations. This is not about Brexit, or a Labour party campaign, none of this is orchestrated.” Richard Fuller, Tory MP for North East Bedfordshire, wrote to constituents: “I have been struck by just how many emails I have received from constituents about the actions taken by Mr Cummings and the strength of sentiment. “Most emails contained strong criticisms. The words used by constituents to express their feeling – ‘disgust’, ‘incensed’, ‘disgraceful’, ‘shameful’, ‘anger’ – convey clearly how deeply hurtful this revelation has been for them. “Many constituents included personal stories of sacrifice and loss; a number sharing the searing pain of bereavement in this extraordinary period of isolation and confinement. I have read fully each of the emails sent to me.” He added: “The explanation of this human dilemma has not been communicated in such a manner as to heal the hurt that has been felt. An apology is not always needed as a concession that you did something wrong but sometimes to show that you understand the pain to others that may have been caused.” Diana Johnson, Labour MP for Hull North since 2005, said: “Other than Brexit, this is the biggest postbag I’ve had for many years. And it’s still coming in.”
Polling suggests most people were unconvinced by Cummings’ explanation of his movements, delivered in a hastily arranged press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on Monday. A YouGov poll taken afterwards showed 71% of respondents thought he had broken the rules; the row also appears to have dented the Conservatives’ poll lead over Keir Starmer’s Labour party. Among the Conservatives receiving more than 1,000 emails about Cummings were Alex Chalk, MP for Cheltenham, who has a majority of 981; Stephen Hammond, MP for Wimbledon, whose majority is 628; and Andrew Bowie, the MP for West Aberdeenshire and and Kincardine, with a majority of 843. Not all of the correspondence was negative, although many MPs said their mailbox was overwhelmingly weighted towards criticism of the adviser. Stewart Wood, a Labour peer and Oxford University fellow teaching politics, said the crisis had touched a nerve akin to the MPs’ expenses revelations. “The real worry for government is when something that they do politicises people who normally wouldn’t ever write to their MP about something like this, who never really engage in politics,” he said. “I worked for Gordon Brown for 10 years and the equivalent issue was the expenses crisis. In terms of the nerve it has touched and the kind of people who are responding, it feels a lot like [that].” He added: “I think what’s happened is our daily lives are dominated by what’s coming out of No 10. So we’re hanging on the words of the prime minister and his top team in a way that you normally would never ever get, and that does bring politics into your life much more vividly. So people then inspect the credentials of the people doing that in a much greater way. “The thing that makes this so poisonous for Boris Johnson and the top team is that we’re in this incredibly unusual crisis moment where everything the government does relies on our trust, because everything they do is essentially asking us to change our behaviour. And that requires faith in the integrity and the authority of the government.” One Tory MP said they had received 400 emails, mostly against Cummings. In the Tory stronghold of the south-west, Selaine Saxby, MP for North Devon, was hit with 800 messages and Cherilyn Mackrory, of Truro and Falmouth, said she had received nearly 1,000. Elliot Colburn, 27, the Conservative MP representing the marginal Carshalton and Wallington seat, wrote to Johnson to say he had received more emails on this issue than any other. He said “many hundreds of messages from concerned constituents” had called on Cummings to resign. At the other end of the UK, the leader of the Scottish National party in Westminster, Ian Blackford, said he had received more than 1,000 emails. “At the peak I was getting one email a minute. It’s easily more than 1,000,” he said. Labour’s Rushanara Ali, MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, said she had had 117 emails, with “so many powerful stories of sacrifice”. One of her constituents wrote to say how her mother had died alone of Covid-19 in Sunderland on 8 April and “every instinct” in her body had told to go to be with her for her final moments, but she had abided by the government’s rules. The Labour MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark, Neil Coyle, said he had received 227 emails, only one in support of Cummings. He said: “They are all unique and many are very sad as they explain their anger based on what they’ve been through – including missing relatives at the end of life.” Chris Bryant, Labour MP for the Rhondda, said he had received 20 messages a day and has had a constituent tell him he now has no intention of abiding by the lockdown rules since Cummings’ drive to Durham and later to Barnard Castle. • This article was amended on 30 May 2020. The mother of Rushanara Ali’s constituent died in Sunderland, not London."
2020-05-29T16:15:18Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak confirms furlough scheme to be gradually withdrawn,"Rishi Sunak has confirmed the Treasury is to gradually withdraw its job retention scheme over the next five months, with businesses meeting 20% of the wage bill for their furloughed staff by October. Taxpayers have been meeting the wage bill for 8.4 million workers, at a cost of about £14bn a month, since March. The scheme was aimed at preventing mass layoffs, as lockdown restrictions caused large parts of the economy to shut down.
Employees have been receiving 80% of their usual wage, up to a maximum of £2,500 a month. One million firms are using the scheme, according to data released this week. Sunak said that from August, firms will have to pay employer national insurance and pension contributions for staff they continue to keep on furlough. In addition, they will have to pay 10% of their wages in September. This will rise to 20% in October. Sunak said: “We stood behind Britain’s businesses and workers as we came into this crisis and we stand behind them as we come through the other side. “Now, as we begin to reopen our country and kickstart our economy, these schemes will adjust to ensure those who are able to work can do so, while remaining among the most generous in the world.”
The Treasury has also brought forward the date on which furloughed staff can be brought back part-time, to 1 July. Business groups had pressed for the change, as rule changes mean some sectors can reopen – including non-essential retail on 15 June, for example. Firms will only be able to apply for the job retention scheme or furlough additional employees until 30 June.
Presenting Friday’s daily coronavirus briefing in Downing Street, Sunak also announced self-employed workers whose income has been hit by the crisis would be able to claim a second grant. Those who qualified for the Treasury’s self-employment income support scheme would be able to apply for another payment, calculated as 70% of their monthly profits, up to a ceiling of £6,570. The first round of payments were based on 80% of monthly profits. Some sectors are tentatively reopening as lockdown restrictions are eased. With social distancing guidelines likely to remain in force for the foreseeable future, however, many will have seen their previous business model shattered. As the furlough scheme tapers away, they will face tough decisions about whether to keep staff on the payroll. Sunak warned on Friday that “not everything will look the same as before”. He said: “It won’t be the case that we can simply put the key in the lock, open the door and step into the world as it was in January.” “I do want to acknowledge that we haven’t been able to support everyone in the exact way they would want. I understand some people have felt frustrated, but you were not and have not been forgotten.”
Business groups and trades unions welcomed the changes to the scheme. Mike Cherry, the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “By providing employers with the adaptability they’ll require as businesses adjust to a new normal, and bringing forward the flexible furlough launch date, the government is giving hope to small firms right across the UK.” Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite union, said: “The chancellor has listened to trade unions like Unite who have been calling for flexible and incremental changes to the jobs retention scheme to allow businesses to get back on their feet, protecting jobs in the process.” But he called for the government to support hard-hit sectors, to avoid mass unemployment. “Wage assistance is a great help, but much of the economy, especially aviation, manufacturing and hospitality, urgently need[s] sector-level support to adjust to the enormous challenges posed by Covid-19. We have to enable businesses to develop new products and build back demand while holding on to the skilled workforce that they have invested in over the years,” he said. Shadow Chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: “The chancellor must publish the evidence behind these decisions to provide reassurance that his proposals won’t cause an additional spike in unemployment, and an even more difficult economic recovery from this crisis.” Sunak has previously warned the UK faces a “severe recession like no other”. Claims for universal credit have already shot up by 1.8m since the crisis began, although these will include people still in employment whose income has dropped, as well as the newly unemployed. Speaking on Friday, he said: “There will be hardship for many and that weighs heavily on my shoulders.” The chancellor is understood to be considering holding a mini-budget in the summer, as the Treasury weighs up how to provide more support for those losing their jobs in the coming months. It also wants to shore up the public finances in the face of the unprecedented cost of the coronavirus rescue package. Sunak had initially been reluctant to extend fresh support to the self-employed, many of whom the Treasury believes have been able to continue working. But he faced a vocal campaign from MPs, with more than 100 signing a letter urging him to do more. Coordinated by Labour MP Siobhan McDonagh, the letter said: “Removing what is already in place would pull the safety net from under the feet of millions of self-employed workers. How can it be right for the furloughed scheme to continue but this scheme to not?” The Treasury stressed that those qualifying for the scheme, which has already paid out £6.8bn to 2.3 million people, would be able to claim a second and final payment. The prime minister had previously suggested the government would offer “parity of support” to employees and the self-employed. Official figures published last month gave the first snapshot of the catastrophic impact of the pandemic on the economy. The Office for National Statistics said GDP declined by 2% in the first quarter of the year – despite the fact lockdown restrictions only came into force in March. Key dates June and July The government will pay 80% of wages up to a cap of £2,500 plus employer national insurance (ER NICs) and pension contributions. Employers are not required to pay anything. The scheme will close to new entrants on 30 June. In July, businesses can start bringing furloughed staff back part-time and employers will pay their wages for hours worked. August The taper starts. The government still pays 80% of wages up to £2,500, but employers must now pay ER NICs and pension contributions. For an average employer this represents 5% of employment costs had an employee not been furloughed. September Government pays 70% of wages up to a cap of £2,190. Firms must contribute 10% of wages plus ER NICs and pension contributions – about 14% of gross employment costs pre-furlough. October Government pays 60% of wages up to a cap of £1,875. Employers contribute 20% plus ER NICs and pension – about 23% of gross employment costs pre-furlough. Self-employed The extension of the scheme will include grants being cut to 70% of average monthly trading profits from the current level of 80%. Applications allowed from August. The funds will be paid out in a single instalment covering three months’ worth of profits, capped at £6,570 in total."

2020-05-29T15:00:26Z,politics,Politics,June Brexit summit on cards as talks head for deadlock,"Brexit talks are heading towards deadlock as senior advisers in Brussels and London concede a breakthrough in the final round of talks next week is unlikely. It means a high-level political summit between Boris Johnson and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in the middle of June is now almost certain as talks among officials on a trade deal and the future relationship hit the buffers. At a London seminar on Friday, Barnier’s senior adviser, Stefaan de Rynck, revealed he thought there was little chance of a deal on fishing being agreed by the 30 June deadline.
Missing this deadline is significant as this was one of the conditions set out in the political relationship as necessary before a wider free trade deal can be secured. “I would be surprised if we get to an agreement by the end of June, but it is not excluded, but it is a tall order clearly because we are nearly June,” De Rynck told the webinar at the Institute for Government on Friday. This chimes with the outlook of the UK: this week the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, told a select committee that he was “beginning to think we might not make it by 30 June”. The deadline was built into the political declaration as an aspiration but the EU has insisted that there must be an outline agreement in place before a wider free trade deal can be secured. The UK has a one-off right to request an extension to the transition period to give a deal more time but Johnson has repeatedly said he will not do this. Some believe this will lead to a last-minute narrow trade deal in October or November, but De Rynck said this would still mean “disruption” on 1 January, warning car manufacturers they would have to restart their no-deal planning. De Rynck said the EU was pleased with the “positive” developments on the Northern Ireland protocol regarding checks and that Michael Gove’s command paper on the subject would now “unlock the process”. But he said the EU and businesses needed to see more “operational detail”.
As both sides prepare for talks next week, they acknowledge fundamental disagreements on state aid, governance and a level playing field in work and environmental standards, but also around data sharing and free movement. De Rynck said the UK had continued its “have your cake and eat it” approach, seeking benefits of the free market without compromise; wanting free movement for workers in the services sector, for example, while at the same time closing borders to EU citizens in the UK. Barnier recently warned the approach would falter because “you can’t dance at the same time at two wedding parties”. De Rynck revealed the EU was surprised to hear in the last round of talks that the UK wanted to continued real-time access to passenger records within the Schengen area but wanted to “deviate” from legally binding issues such as privacy. He also pushed back against suggestions that Barnier would like to be more flexible in talks but was hidebound by EU leaders’ mandate. “I don’t think there’s any appetite on the EU side to revise the mandate,” he said, pointing out it was only agreed in February after a lengthy consultation process."
2020-05-28T20:19:27Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson brushes off Tory revolt over Dominic Cummings,"Boris Johnson has brushed aside a growing revolt of almost 100 of his own MPs and defied ongoing calls for Dominic Cummings to be sacked, despite a police investigation that failed to exonerate him for a potential breach of lockdown. The prime minister was again besieged by questions about his chief adviser as the crisis overshadowed his decision to cautiously ease the lockdown in England, which will require millions of citizens to abide by the letter and spirit of new guidelines. Johnson said the matter was closed after Durham police concluded Cummings may have broken lockdown rules but decided they would take no action against him.
The prime minister also blocked journalists from asking his top scientific advisers, Prof Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance, about their expert opinion on the matter. Cummings’ actions remained in the spotlight for a sixth day, however, after the police concluded that his family trip to Barnard Castle, a beauty spot on the River Tees, may have been in breach of “stay at home” guidance and would have led officers to tell him to turn around had he been stopped. A police examination of the facts surrounding Cummings’ time in the north-east, 260 miles from his London home, has concluded that no further action will be taken. The force said it would not issue fines retrospectively. Cummings has denied any wrongdoing following a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Daily Mirror, and has received Johnson’s full backing since the details were published last weekend.
Deep discontent among Tory MPs has grown over the course of the week, however, in response to public anger. Ninety-nine have either called for Cummings to be sacked, demanded an apology or otherwise criticised his conduct. The figures suggest nearing half of the party’s backbenchers are unhappy with Cummings’ actions, while the vast majority of the “payroll vote” – government ministers, whips, parliamentary private secretaries and those in party positions – are supportive of Johnson’s position or silent on it. Tory MPs to break their silence most recently include Karen Bradley, a former culture secretary under Theresa May, who said she was not convinced by his explanation. “I can well understand that any parent wants to protect their child, and have enormous sympathy with acting to do that. But so much of the account goes beyond that simple human instinct and suggests that there were breaches of the rules to avoid some of the hardships that many have endured,” she said. “Mr Cummings is, in my view, causing significant damage to the work that the government are doing to get us through the pandemic. I hope that he will recognise this and consider his position.”
Two former work and pensions secretaries also weighed in. Esther McVey, like Cummings an ardent Brexiter, said she would have resigned her position had she been in the same situation, and Stephen Crabb said Cummings was “wrong to arrogantly brush away the allegations when they first appeared”. “He just made matters worse. People have got every right to ask what on earth he was doing in Durham and Barnard Castle during lockdown. I would have preferred to see the cabinet secretary do a proper inquiry into the allegations and for Cummings to step aside to allow that to happen,” he said. Johnson avoided any mention of his chief adviser’s name during the daily No 10 press briefing. He also twice prevented questions from journalists who wanted to know whether Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, and Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, believed Cummings had stuck to the rules. He interjected to say he wanted to protect the two scientists “from what I think would be an unfair and unnecessary attempt to ask any political questions”. On a third time of asking, Whitty and Vallance said they did not want to get involved in politics. Whitty said: “The desire to not get pulled into politics is far stronger on the part of Sir Patrick and me than it is in the prime minister.” Vallance added: “I’m a civil servant, I’m politically neutral, I don’t want to get involved in politics at all.” Their silence on the matter will fuel suspicions that they are not willing to back up the prime minister’s assertions that he believes Cummings did not break the lockdown rules. There have been questions over the absence of the UK’s two most senior experts from the daily press conference since news broke of Cummings’ trip from London to Durham while his wife was showing possible coronavirus symptoms.
Whitty and Vallance were due to appear at Monday’s press conference but were replaced at the last minute by Prof Pauline Doyle, an expert from Public Health England. The deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, previously answered questions about Cummings actions. “If you’re symptomatic, you stay at home, take yourself out of society as quickly as you can and stay there, unless there’s extreme risk to life,” she said. Cummings said in his statement on Monday that he suspected he and his wife may have contracted coronavirus, but that neither of them had classic symptoms before they travelled to Durham to seek childcare if needed. Labour also kept the pressure on Johnson. Keir Starmer, the party leader, said it was “extraordinary that the prime minister stopped the scientists being able to answer a question put to them by journalists”. Answering questions on a virtual Q&A with voters, Starmer said this reflected badly on Johnson: “The government has been saying for weeks on end, this is about transparency, it’s about answering whatever questions you’ve got. And then on the question people want to hear an answer on, he stops them answering. It’s the wrong thing to do. “I don’t think he’s going to have impressed anybody with that tonight. I don’t think he’s impressed anybody over the past week.” Cummings’ actions and No 10’s defence of them had stirred something “personal and emotional” in the public, Starmer said. “Lots of people are beating themselves up because they’re not doing something for somebody they love, and that’s why when they saw Cummings apparently saying ‘that’s your rule, but I don’t necessarily have to follow it,’ it really struck not a party political chord but something deep in everybody.”
Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland and SNP leader, said she wanted to move on from talking about Cummings, but also made clear she thought he “should no longer be in post”. “That is a matter for the prime minister,” she said. “But I think if the prime minister is putting the integrity and trust in the vital public health message that he is seeking to communicate and all of us are seeking to communicate first then he will take action that means Dominic Cummings does not continue to distract from that.” A No 10 spokesperson said: “The police have made clear they are taking no action against Mr Cummings over his self-isolation and that going to Durham did not breach the regulations. The prime minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and legally given all the circumstances and he regards this issue as closed.” • This article was amended on 29 May 2020 because it located Barnard Castle on Teesside; rather it is on the River Tees. An earlier version also spelled Teesside as Teeside."
2020-05-28T20:02:58Z,politics,Politics,Durham police believe Cummings probably did break lockdown rules,"Durham police believe Dominic Cummings probably did break lockdown rules following an investigation into his travels around north-east England during lockdown, the Guardian understands. On Thursday the force released a report saying the prime minister’s special adviser “might have” breached health protection regulations when he embarked on a 52-mile round trip to the town of Barnard Castle with his wife and son on her birthday. Officers might have intervened to send him home had they caught him on the trip on 12 April, or fined him if he refused, the report said.
His 260-mile journey to Durham on 27 March did not break health protection regulations, the report concluded, though it made no finding in relation to “stay at home” government guidance. Cummings has denied any wrongdoing and said the journey on 12 April, Easter Sunday, was to test his eyesight. The prime minister and cabinet continued to stand by him on Thursday. As part of their inquiry, detectives examined the aide’s press conference on Monday, where he repeatedly said that he had done nothing wrong, and concluded he probably did. Police stopped short of a definitive declaration of rule-breaking because lockdown regulations had not been tested in the courts, sources with knowledge of the force’s thinking told the Guardian. They were keen not to appear to act as “judge and jury”, it is understood.
Durham is one of the forces least likely to issue fines, and said it would not act retrospectively against Cummings, whose trips were revealed by a joint Guardian and Daily Mirror investigation. Mike Barton, a former chief constable of Durham police, said of the report: “This is not an exoneration … They would have told him to go home [during the Barnard Castle journey] and if he refused they would have fined him.” He said the police statement on Cummings’ journey from London to Durham contained thinly coded criticism: “They are [in effect] saying he broke the guidance to stay at home, but not the regulations that were put into law. But clearly he has flouted the government plea to stay at home.” Sir Peter Fahy, a former chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said: “People will be puzzled. How is the PM saying the Barnard Castle trip is legal when Durham police say it is not? It is an uncomfortable position the police have been left in. The public have to feel that people in positions of power are complying with the law. That’s where there is a danger.” Robin Lees, the retired chemistry teacher who spotted Cummings in Barnard Castle and took a note of his car registration number, said he welcomed the police conclusion. “I did not need to drive 60 miles to test my eyesight – I knew it was him. Lots of Tory MPs have said he should resign but I guess that is up to him,” he said. “I can’t really decide on his motivation but his statement does match mine. They [the police] said he broke the rules, just like the other two – Scottish chief medical officer Catherine Calderwood and government scientific adviser Neil Ferguson. They did not get fined but they did resign.” The Durham police statement said: “Durham constabulary have examined the circumstances surrounding the journey to Barnard Castle (including ANPR [automatic number plate recognition], witness evidence and a review of Mr Cummings’ press conference on 25 May 2020) and have concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention. Durham constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing. “Had a Durham constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings to return to the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis. Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken.” Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, said: “The police have confirmed what we all knew, that Dominic Cummings broke the rules he helped to write. The country cannot afford for this saga to carry on. Only Boris Johnson can draw a line under it. “Keir Starmer has said that if he was prime minister, he would have sacked Dominic Cummings. Boris Johnson should follow that advice. If he does not act then he will send a clear message that there is one rule for his closest adviser and another for the British people.” Continuing to back Cummings, a No 10 spokesman said: ‘The police have made clear they are taking no action against Mr Cummings over his self-isolation and that going to Durham did not breach the regulations. The prime minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and legally given all the circumstances and he regards this issue as closed.” In their statement Durham police said of Cummings’ decision to drive from London: “Durham constabulary does not consider that by locating himself at his father’s premises, Mr Cummings committed an offence contrary to regulation 6 of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020. (We are concerned here with breaches of the regulations, not the general government guidance to ‘stay at home’).” The force had carried out an exercise to establish the facts. It was asked to do so on Monday morning by Steve White, the acting police, crime and victims’ commissioner for Durham, who oversees the force.
On Friday the Guardian and the Daily Mirror revealed Cummings had driven from his London home to his parents’ property in Durham on 27 March, at a time when the public were being told to stay at home to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The Durham inquiry said there was “insufficient evidence” to back claims that Cummings was in Durham again on 19 April, and that the prime minister’s top aide had denied it."
2020-05-28T19:15:54Z,politics,Politics,"Rishi Sunak to taper furlough scheme, forcing employers to pay 20% of wages","The government will start tapering its furlough scheme from August by forcing those employers taking part to pay 20% of workers’ wages as well as covering their national insurance and pension contributions. Under plans to be announced by Rishi Sunak over the next few days, the support given by the furlough scheme will be cut back due to government concerns about its spiralling cost and the likely impact on the UK’s growing public spending deficit.
The chancellor is understood to be preparing the final details of the revised scheme after coming under pressure from officials to make employers pay a larger contribution towards the cost of non-working staff as the lockdown begins to ease. Employers have furloughed 8.4 million workers and claimed up to 80% of their wages, to a maximum £2,500 a month. Figures earlier this week revealed that the cost has reached £15bn while a separate scheme to support self-employed workers had cost almost £7bn. Labour has called on the chancellor to bring forward more fundamental reforms by protecting subsidies for the industries hit hardest by coronavirus. Last month Sunak said he would extend the existing scheme until the end of July, but would need to cut the level of subsidy in a second phase running to the end of October. The scheme was launched in March and was initially intended to last just three months, in anticipation of a V-shaped economic recovery that is no longer expected to materialise. Employers groups have warned that a dramatic change to the scheme at the end of July will lead to tens of thousands of redundancies. The Institute of Directors said that a quarter of its members using the job retention scheme risked going bust if they were forced to make any contribution towards furloughed workers’ wages. The draft plans are understood to expect employers to contribute 20% of salaries while the government pays 60% up to a cap of £2,500 a month, down from the 80% employers receive at present. Employers will also be expected to pay national insurance contributions, which they are currently exempt from, and employer pension contributions. The chancellor is also expected to shut the furlough scheme to new entrants, a move that will help cap the bill to the Treasury, but also prevent employers from rotating staff who are currently not working with those who have spent recent weeks at work.
The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s independent economic forecaster, has forecast that the overall bill for the government’s jobs subsidy schemes could hit £80bn, pushing the overall cost of fighting the coronavirus outbreak to more than £300bn. Treasury officials are known to be concerned at the spiralling cost of the department’s rescue schemes and keen to limit the damage to the public finances. Last month a leaked letter written by officials proposed raising taxes or imposing a public sector wage freeze to bring down government borrowing."
2020-05-28T19:03:21Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson sacrifices top scientists on altar of Classic Dom | John Crace,"Yesterday I wrote that the best way to understand the state the country is in was to consider it a banana republic. I’d meant it as a joke, but at the Downing Street press conference , Boris Johnson went out of his way to prove me right. The UK’s very own dictator might not have much of a reputation left to protect, but Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance most certainly did. Yet to save what now passes for his career, Boris went out of his way to trash the reputations of both the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser. Just as unbelievably, a plainly terrified Whitty and Vallance just stood there and took it. If either had a smidgeon of self worth, both would have walked out once the questions began. It seems that many people have been making simple category errors with Boris. They have assumed that Dominic Cummings’s understudy has an intelligence and morality to compromise. That’s why more than 70% of the country had said that Johnson should do the right thing and sack his special adviser for breaking the guidelines and undermining the government’s public health message. Yet the evidence all points to something more disturbing. That beyond an ability to recite the odd Latin phrase, Boris is actually quite dim. Worse still he is totally amoral. So the very idea of him doing the right thing is a complete non-starter. Right from the start of the briefing, Boris set out to gaslight the entire nation. Things were great. Improving rapidly. So he was now in a position to re-announce some easing of the lockdown measures that he had already announced during the previous week. Sure it might be a bit of a risk, as the track and trace programme wouldn’t be properly up and running properly till the end of June. But hey! The weather was nice and everyone deserved a break. And he really appreciated the sacrifices that everyone had been making so that Dom and his family could take a well-earned day out to Barnard Castle. Even Whitty and Vallance appeared slightly taken aback by Johnson’s bullish optimism. Matt Hancock might have found it hysterically funny that the UK now had the worst death rate in the world during an interview with Kay Burley on Sky, but they both thought the situation was basically a bit shit and that we were a long way behind most other European countries. It was when the questions started coming in that Boris went full psycho failed state. Given this was the first time that the CMO and CSA for England had been allowed out in public since Cummings’ moonlight flit to Durham had come to public notice, most journalists were keen to know if Whitty and Vallance endorsed Classic Dom’s course of action during the end of March and the first two weeks of April. But before either had a chance to speak, Boris effectively silenced them. They wouldn’t be commenting on this, he said, before preventing Laura Kuenssberg from asking a follow-up question by muting her. Almost every other journalist had similar questions. And each time Boris either ignored them or just repeated that Whitty and Vallance couldn’t get involved in political issues. It’s possible that both men had only agreed to stand alongside the Great Dictator on the proviso they were allowed to say nothing. If so that was a huge mistake on their part, because reputations that had taken decades to build were shredded in a matter of minutes. The whole point was that the scientific and the political have become entwined, not least because Laughing Boy had chosen to make it so. And the questions the scientists were being asked were matters of scientific judgement. Would they recommend doing what Classic Dom had done? Was that the public health message they wanted to put out to the country? Yet under a lot of pressure from Boris – you can add bullying to his character defects – they both played dumb. Better to have refused to prop up Boris than to have been used as mugs. Whitty and Vallance weren’t even allowed to answer a basic question of whether they would recommend a 50-mile round trip with your child in the back of the car as a good way of checking if your eyesight was fit to drive. That was about as straightforward a scientific yes or no question as you could get. But still they didn’t dare say a word. Other pressers have been tetchy and opaque, but this one had been a new low. Boris hadn’t demeaned himself because there’s nothing left to demean. But he had demeaned his CMO and CSA and he had demeaned the UK by treating its citizens with total contempt. In saving Dom, he has ruined what was left of his credibility. And all across the country, Tory MPs and Tory voters were beginning to ask themselves one simple question. Ever get the feeling you’ve been had?"
2020-05-28T18:31:32Z,politics,Politics,Johnson blocks top scientists from talking about Cummings,"Boris Johnson has blocked his two most senior scientific advisers from answering questions on whether his senior aide, Dominic Cummings, broke the lockdown. At No 10’s daily press conference, the prime minister twice prevented questions from journalists who wanted to know whether Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, believed Cummings had stuck to the rules. Johnson said he wanted to “draw a line” under the Cummings affair, after Durham constabulary said the aide might have committed a “minor breach” of the rules.
“I’ve said quite a lot on this matter already and what I also note is that what Durham police said was that they were going to take no action and that the matter was closed,” he said, without mentioning Cummings’ name. The prime minister then said he would not allow Vallance or Whitty to answer questions on the row to “protect them from what I think would be an unfair and unnecessary attempt to ask any political questions”. “It’s very, very important that our medical officers and scientific advisers do not get dragged into what I think most people would recognise is fundamentally a political argument,” he said. On a third time of asking, Whitty and Vallance said they did not want themselves to get involved in politics. Whitty said: “The desire to not get pulled into politics is far stronger on the part of Sir Patrick and me than it is in the prime minister.”
Vallance added: “I’m a civil servant, I’m politically neutral, I don’t want to get involved in politics at all.” But their silence on the matter will fuel suspicions that they are not willing to back up the prime minister’s assertions that he believes Cummings did not break the lockdown rules. There have been questions over the absence of the UK’s senior experts from the daily press conference since revelations emerged of Cummings’ journey from London to Durham while his wife had suspected coronavirus, and about a 60-mile round-trip to a beauty spot. Whitty and Vallance were due to appear at Monday’s press conference but were replaced at the last minute by Prof Pauline Doyle, an expert from Public Health England. The deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, previously made an appearance and answered questions about the rules around Cummings’ actions, saying: “If you’re symptomatic, you stay at home, take yourself out of society as quickly as you can and stay there, unless there’s extreme risk to life.” Cummings said in his statement on Monday that while he suspected he and his wife could have contracted the coronavirus, neither of them had classic symptoms before they travelled to Durham. Speaking after the press conference, Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said it was “extraordinary that the prime minister had stopped the scientists being able to answer a question put to them by journalists”. Answering questions on one of his regular Zoom Q&As with voters, Starmer said it reflected badly on Johnson. He said: “The government has been saying for weeks on end, this is about transparency, it’s about answering whatever questions you’ve got. And then on the question people want to hear an answer on, he stops them answering – it’s the wrong thing to do.
“I don’t think he’s going to have impressed anybody with that tonight. I don’t think he’s impressed anybody over the past week.” Cummings’ actions and the defence of them by No 10 had stirred something “personal and emotional” in the public, Starmer said. “Lots of people are beating themselves up because they’re not doing something for somebody they love, and that’s why, when they saw Cummings apparently saying, ‘That’s your rule, but I don’t necessarily have to follow it,’ it really struck not a party political chord but something deep in everybody.”"
2020-05-28T18:04:44Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings' lockdown trip: what critical Tory MPs say,"Scores of Conservative MPs have criticised Dominic Cummings’ trip to Durham during lockdown. Here is what some have said: Penny Mordaunt, Portsmouth North, Cabinet Office minister and former defence secretary: “Despite Mr Cummings’ statement, I am personally still not clear of the facts. There are some inconsistencies in his account of events and the reasons behind it.” Sajid Javid, Bromsgrove, former chancellor: “I do not believe Mr Cummings’ journey to County Durham to isolate on his family’s estate was necessary or justified. I remain unconvinced his visit to Barnard Castle could be considered reasonable. I was also deeply concerned by his decision to return to Downing Street directly after coming into contact with a family member who was ill, potentially with coronavirus.”
Douglas Ross, Moray, who resigned as a Scotland Office minister: “I have constituents who didn’t get to say goodbye to loved ones; families who could not mourn together; people who didn’t visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government. I cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right.” Jeremy Wright, Kenilworth and Southam, former attorney general: “Mr Cummings’ actions and his justification of them will, in my judgment, make it less likely that others will continue to interpret those exceptional circumstances clauses restrictively. This is more important than the position of any individual in Downing Street and therefore, fairly or unfairly, I have concluded that it would be better for Mr Cummings to leave his position at Downing Street.” Karen Bradley, Staffordshire Moorlands, former culture secretary: “I am afraid that I am not convinced by his explanation. I can well understand that any parent wants to protect their child, and have enormous sympathy with acting to do that. But so much of the account goes beyond that simple human instinct and suggests that there were breaches of the rules to avoid some of the hardships that many have endured … Mr Cummings is, in my view, causing significant damage to the work that the government are doing to get us through the pandemic. I hope that he will recognise this and consider his position.” Stephen Crabb, Preseli Pembrokeshire, former work and pensions secretary: “I thought Dominic Cummings was wrong to arrogantly brush away the allegations when they first appeared. He just made matters worse. People have got every right to ask what on earth he was doing in Durham and Barnard Castle during lockdown. I would have preferred to see the cabinet secretary do a proper inquiry into the allegations and for Cummings to step aside to allow that to happen.” Esther McVey, Tatton, former work and pensions secretary: “Whilst the future of Dominic Cummings is a matter for him and the prime minister, had I been in the same situation, I would have resigned my position.”
George Freeman, Mid-Norfolk, former science minister: “After 48 hours and c1,000 emails from constituents expressing outage at the PM’s chief of staff breaking the lockdown and not apologising, it’s clear that public anger at the betrayal of their trust and compliance now risks a collapse of respect for HMG public health advice.” Richard Graham, Gloucester, Conservative MP: “In any crisis, nations need to believe in their leadership, and in a democracy emergency guidelines can only be enforced by consensus, which comes from trust in the message. That trust can be damaged if there’s a perception that some around the leaders are not expected to show the same commitment to the rules as the rest of us. Mr Cummings’ actions at that time fail that simple yardstick, even if there is no legal case.” Cherilyn Mackrory, MP for Truro and Falmouth, 2019 intake: “As a wife and a mum, I do understand what Mr Cummings was trying to achieve by safeguarding his family. However, by making that journey, by taking that course of action, it may have endangered many, many more. What Mr Cummings did may not have been illegal, but it did go against clear government advice, the government advice that you and I, and the rest of the country, took at face value."
2020-05-28T16:19:46Z,politics,Politics,The view from Barnard Castle: 'He's made a mockery of us',"At Barnard Castle there has been angry condemnation about the police decision not to take action against Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s most senior aide, after his 52-mile round trip to the beauty spot on 12 April, apparently to test his eyesight. Dan Goldsmith, 43, said: “To come here from Durham isn’t a short journey and it wasn’t an essential journey by any means. It’s clear to everyone that what he did was wrong – it was a breach – and if the police accept that they should be taking actions against him. “It seems to me to be – again – one rule for ordinary people and another for influential people. It’s a sham. The man is an arse and he should have been prosecuted and treated the same way as anyone else would have been in those circumstances.”
Hyleen Wood, 58, and Stuart Wood, 55, from Chester-le-Street near Durham, said the whole episode made a mockery of the lockdown. “We have seen the police statement and it seems there are two sets of rules – one for him [Cummings] and another for us. It is annoying that whilst we all made sacrifices, he was driving up to his parents house with symptoms of coronavirus,” said Hyleen Wood. “It is very frustrating and his reasons make very little sense – it was quite clear what we were asked to do. We have all obeyed the rules and he has flouted it in front of us, making a mockery of what we are doing,” she said.
Her husband, Stuart, on his first day out since lockdown began after being furloughed from his job at a recycling plant, said Cummings needs to apologise and tell the truth. “I was furloughed on 21 March and I haven’t left my local area since then, apart from to take the dog for a walk. “Cummings should have apologised and Boris Johnson is desperately trying to brush this under the carpet. We were all expected to do our bit, yet he doesn’t appear to have done that and then that whole story about his eyesight – he totally tripped himself up there,” he said. Emily Davies, 26, is 18 weeks’ pregnant and this week had her latest scan, which her partner, Luke Stebbens, 26, was unable to attend.
Davies said: “This is our first baby and it’s an important time for us, it’s a time when I’d like him to be present for everything, especially to see the scan, but under the restrictions he can’t be. “And at the same time Dominic Cummings can drive here apparently to test his eyesight. Who drives a car to see whether they can see well enough to drive a car? “If he committed an offence, he should have been prosecuted. If it had been an ordinary member of the public, they’d have been done for it, he should have been treated the same.”
Stebbens added: “A friend of mine was fined driving to work. He didn’t realise his workplace wasn’t open but he was still stopped and fined by Durham police. And Cummings goes for a drive apparently to find out if he can see properly and gets away with it. How is that fair?” Dennis Richards, 58, said: “I think people in Barnard Castle have had enough of this issue now and I do feel that it’s a distraction from more important matters when the health of so many people is at risk. “But that said, I think Dominic Cummings should have accepted that what he did was wrong, because it was, and that he should have gone from government one way or another. “It wasn’t a major crime by any means but if you’ve done wrong you should be accountable for it and he hasn’t been.” Meanwhile, Ann-Marie Davies, 55, from Barnard Castle, said: “It is just one of those things and hindsight is a great thing but an apology would have been good. If he had just said: ‘I did it for the best interests of my family’ – it would have been better.”"
2020-05-28T15:36:37Z,politics,Politics,What does Durham police's statement on Dominic Cummings tell us?,"The formal statement from Durham police on Dominic Cummings’ travels to the county during lockdown is sufficiently cautious that both the prime minister’s chief adviser and his accusers are likely to quote elements to support their arguments. Here we analyse key sections of the statement. The trip from London to Durham On 27 March 2020, Dominic Cummings drove to Durham to self-isolate in a property owned by his father. Durham constabulary does not consider that by locating himself at his father’s premises, Mr Cummings committed an offence contrary to regulation 6 of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020. (We are concerned here with breaches of the regulations, not the general government guidance to “stay at home”.) Analysis: The force does not say Cummings was right or wrong to drive from London to Durham. Instead, its statement draws the clear distinction between government guidance and legislation. The government has failed to align the law as set out in the health protection regulations with NHS or government guidance, and such ambiguities over personal responsibility have repeatedly arisen during the pandemic. Regulation 6 in the emergency regulations is the one that deals with the list of “reasonable excuses” for someone to be away from their home, of which there are many. The excuses in force at the beginning of April have since been amended. The ‘test drive’ to Barnard Castle On 12 April 2020, Mr Cummings drove approximately 26 miles from his father’s property to Barnard Castle with his wife and son. He stated on 25 May 2020 that the purpose of this drive was to test his resilience to drive to London the following day, including whether his eyesight was sufficiently recovered, his period of self-isolation having ended. Durham constabulary have examined the circumstances surrounding the journey to Barnard Castle (including ANPR [automatic number plate recognition], witness evidence and a review of Mr Cummings’ press conference on 25 May 2020) and have concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention. Durham constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing. Had a Durham constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings to return to the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis. Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken. In line with Durham constabulary’s general approach throughout the pandemic, there is no intention to take retrospective action in respect of the Barnard Castle incident since this would amount to treating Mr Cummings differently from other members of the public. Analysis: Durham police decided they could only say Cummings “might” have breached the rule, because the courts have not yet tested the legislation. The chief constable, Jo Farrell, felt it was not for police to “convict” Cummings, and hence the use of the word “might”. Its use is not meant as a sign of doubt about the flouting of the regulation. Also, it is possible Cummings might have come up with a compelling reasonable excuse. Several legal commentators immediately focused on the conditional point. David Allen Green tweeted: “The ‘might’ in the statement means that the police would have ‘considered’ that there was a breach for the exercise [of] the 8(3)(a) power. It would not be for the police officer to determine criminal liability: that is a matter for the court.” Similarly the Secret Barrister, an anonymous criminal legal expert, tweeted: “The police having considered the evidence have expressed the view that Cummings did break the law.” No further action – police policy Durham constabulary has not taken retrospective action against any other person. By way of further context, Durham Constabulary has followed government guidance on management of alleged breaches of the regulations with the emphasis on the NPCC and College of Policing 4Es: Engage, Explain and Encourage before Enforcement. Finally, commentary in the media has suggested that Mr Cummings was in Durham on 19 April 2020. Mr Cummings denies this and Durham constabulary have seen insufficient evidence to support this allegation. Therefore Durham constabulary will take no further action in this matter and has informed Mr Cummings of this decision. Analysis: The statement makes clear the force is not going to pursue Cummings – or anyone – retrospectively. On the matter of the claims that Cummings was seen in Durham on 19 April, officers did not make a definitive ruling."
2020-05-28T14:26:26Z,politics,Politics,"Dominic Cummings potentially broke lockdown rules, say Durham police","Dominic Cummings’ family trip to Barnard Castle potentially broke lockdown rules and would have led to police telling him to turn around had he been stopped, Durham police have concluded. A police examination of the facts surrounding Cummings’ time in the north-east, 260 miles (420km) from his London home, has said no further action will be taken, with the force saying they will not retrospectively issue fines. Cummings had vehemently denied any wrongdoing following an investigation by the Guardian and the Daily Mirror, and has received the full backing of Boris Johnson, who has urged politicians and the public to “move on” from the crisis. But Labour accused Cummings of “[breaking] the rules he helped to write” while the former chief constable of Durham police said the report did not get the prime minister’s chief aide off the hook. Mike Barton said the findings from the force he commanded until last year were clear and damning, adding: “This is not an exoneration.” Cummings’ 52-mile round trip to the beauty spot of Barnard Castle on 12 April from his family’s Durham farm has been assessed by police as a potential minor breach of health protection regulations. He has said he made the journey with his wife and son to test his eyesight ahead of his drive back to London the following day. The statement by Durham police says Cummings did not break the law when he drove from London to Durham on 27 March but it makes clear that police did not consider whether it breached government guidance to “stay at home”. The statement said: “Durham constabulary have examined the circumstances surrounding the journey to Barnard Castle (including ANPR [automatic number plate recognition], witness evidence and a review of Mr Cummings’s press conference on 25 May 2020) and have concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention. Durham constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing.
“Had a Durham constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings to return to the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis. Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken.” Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, said:“The police have confirmed what we all knew, that Dominic Cummings broke the rules he helped to write. The country cannot afford for this saga to carry on. Only Boris Johnson can draw a line under it. “Keir Starmer has said that if he was prime minister, he would have sacked Dominic Cummings. Boris Johnson should follow that advice. If he does not act then he will send a clear message that there is one rule for his closest adviser and another for the British people.” Continuing to back Cummings, a No 10 spokesman said: ‘The police have made clear they are taking no action against Mr Cummings over his self-isolation and that going to Durham did not breach the regulations. “The prime minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and legally given all the circumstances and he regards this issue as closed.” In their statement Durham police said of Cummings’ decision to drive from London: “Durham constabulary does not consider that by locating himself at his father’s premises, Mr Cummings committed an offence contrary to regulation 6 of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020. (We are concerned here with breaches of the regulations, not the general government guidance to ‘stay at home’).”
Barton said of Cummings’ drive to Barnard Castle: “They would have told him to go home and if he refused they would have fined him.” He said the police statement on Cummings’ journey from London to the north-east contained thinly coded criticism: “They are [in effect] saying he broke the guidance to stay at home, but not the regulations that were put into law. But clearly he has flouted the government plea to stay at home.” On Monday, Cummings admitted he had driven with his family to Durham. He also admitted to the Barnard Castle trip and said he got out of the car near the River Tees for up to 15 minutes. He said he wanted to test his eyesight and whether he was fit enough to make the long drive back to London. The force had carried out an exercise to establish the facts. It was asked to do so on Monday morning by Steve White, the acting police, crime and victims’ commissioner for Durham, who oversees the force. On Friday the Guardian and the Daily Mirror revealed Cummings had driven from his London home to his parents’ property in Durham on 27 March, at a time when the public were being told to stay at home to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The Durham inquiry said there was “insufficient evidence” to back claims that Cummings was in Durham again on 19 April, and that the prime minister’s top aide had denied it. Durham police have been among the forces least likely to take enforcement action for lockdown breaches and they said: “In line with Durham constabulary’s general approach throughout the pandemic, there is no intention to take retrospective action in respect of the Barnard Castle incident since this would amount to treating Mr Cummings differently from other members of the public. Durham constabulary has not taken retrospective action against any other person.” Its chief constable, Jo Farrell, acted after receiving a letter from White asking her to look at all the claims about Cummings’ time in Durham. As part of their inquiry Durham police visited and took a statement from Robin Lees, a retired chemistry teacher, who had seen Cummings at Barnard Castle."
2020-05-28T14:21:42Z,politics,Politics,Jacob Rees-Mogg accused of bungling plans for Commons return,"Ministers have been accused of bungling plans for MPs to return to parliament in person, after the government said this would happen next week despite the lack of any way for voting to take place safely. The move by Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons leader, to end the interim part-virtual sittings, in which some MPs have been able to speak and vote remotely, had already been heavily criticised for discriminating against older MPs and those with disabilities or chronic illnesses, who do not want to put their health at risk by attending in person.
Rees-Mogg had said MPs would set an example to the rest of the country by voting in person, but in a letter to MPs on Thursday he said this would be impossible, because Public Health England (PHE) had advised that it was unsafe for MPs to be walking through different lobbies to vote. Despite this, the Commons will sit physically on Tuesday after a week-long recess. It will start at 11.30am rather than 2.30pm to debate a government motion on how to proceed.
In a letter to MPs the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, said he had agreed to the government plan: “Now that I have agreed to a recall on Tuesday, it is for the government to decide what proposal for voting it wishes to put forward. “I have been clear to the government and to opposition parties that I would prefer cross-party agreement to be reached about the way in which the house should conduct its proceedings when the house returns, including on how divisions should take place.”
Hoyle said the PHE advice on voting had changed, and it was clear that “the house simply cannot conduct divisions safely via the lobbies”. He wrote: “There are pinch points in the lobbies where MPs are recorded by clerks and counted by tellers where it would be difficult to maintain social distancing, even though perspex booths were prepared for two of the division desks.” Such votes would also risk taking longer than allowed under parliamentary proceedings, he added. Hoyle said that if the government and opposition were unable to agree a way forward, he would allow amendments to the government motion for new procedures. Valerie Vaz, the shadow Commons leader, said it was the “latest example of the government in chaos”. She said: “Jacob Rees-Mogg tried to abolish the hybrid remote parliament, which allowed all MPs to take part regardless of their personal circumstances, without any prior notice and against all advice on the last day parliament met. “He has bungled it and is now forcing parliament to return early solely to correct his earlier discriminatory move.”
Pete Wishart, the Cabinet Office spokesman for the SNP, tweeted: “The government wants us to come back to a parliament that can’t work. An absolute joke.” The Public and Commercial Services union, which represents many security, catering and other support staff in parliament, has also raised concerns about the full return of MPs. The union’s general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said the part-virtual system had worked well, and said it was “strange why the government is in a rush to change course when a second covid spike is such a strong possibility”. A Commons debate on resuming physical sittings before the recess heard concerns from a series of MPs. The former Conservative minister Robert Halfon said the proposals would discriminate and threaten the lives of some MPs. “Is it really morally just to say in effect to MPs, because you are not Tarzan-like and able to swing through the chamber, beating your chest shouting to your constituents: ‘Look, I am here!’ that you are effectively euthanised from the Commons?” he said."
2020-05-28T06:00:23Z,politics,Politics,Quarantine article by Dominic Cummings' wife reported to regulator,"The article that appeared in the Spectator at the end of April painted a picture of a family in turmoil during a pandemic, with a wife describing the anguish of watching as her husband “lay doggo” with Covid-19 for 10 days before they emerged from quarantine “into the almost comical uncertainty of London lockdown”. The column by the magazine’s commissioning editor, Mary Wakefield, about life with her husband, Dominic Cummings, was classic material for the high-Tory magazine: confessional and full of personal details about individuals at the top of British politics, earning the interest of Radio 4’s Today programme, which asked her to read out key details. Never mind that the couple originally emerged from self-isolation in Durham, where they’d travelled during lockdown. And that they had made a 60-mile round trip to a beauty spot to check Cummings’ eyesight, too – both points that were absent from the article. The Spectator, owned by the warring Barclay brothers, is at the centre of a web connecting Cummings, Wakefield – and the prime minister himself. On Wednesday, a spokesperson for Ipso, the press regulator which covers the Spectator, told the Guardian it had received two complaints from members of the public about potential factual inaccuracies in the 1,000-word column by Wakefield, which will mean the magazine will have to justify the article and could result in it being required to publish a correction.
In the process, the Spectator has found itself at the centre of yet another scandal at the heart of Conservative politics. Despite its relatively niche status – its 80,000 print and digital subscribers make it a financial success but give it a limited readership in the scale of modern media – its influence and connections to the current government and wider media world are substantial. Wakefield herself is a fixture of the magazine, having first written for it two decades ago when, just after university, she won a travel writing prize. The editor at the time – and one of the judges – was an up-and-coming journalist and would-be Tory MP called Boris Johnson, who was already setting about making the magazine a byword for Westminster intrigue with his colourful love life and public apologies during an era which saw the magazine dubbed the “Sextator” for his and others’ antics.
The daughter of a baronet, Wakefield grew up at Chillingham Castle – a large country house deep in the Northumberland countryside, an hour’s drive north of Newcastle. Her father, formerly employed by the auction house Christie’s, took possession of the property in the early 1980s and painstakingly restored it after it had been derelict for 50 years. The house is so grand that it was used as the set for key scenes in the 1997 film Elizabeth, starring Cate Blanchett. After rising quickly up the Spectator’s ranks to become deputy editor, Wakefield has remained a core part of the Spectator team, albeit with a limited public profile. One former colleague praised her editing skills and suggested she had a different political approach to her husband, describing her as a “compassionate conservative” who is less involved in aggressive day-to-day politics than the journalistic partners of other leading politicians. “She isn’t Sarah Vine [wife of Michael Gove, and a Daily Mail columnist] ... she’s just his wife, she loves him, she’s got her own thing, they’re very different,” the former colleague said. Wakefield, 45, has so far worked under three editors and stayed on when the current boss, Fraser Nelson, was appointed in 2010, despite herself being viewed as a potential candidate for the top job. “I think in a different world she might have been the first female editor of the Spectator,” said the former colleague. Her career as a journalist at a politics-heavy magazine is perhaps ironic, given her husband’s public insistence that he thinks little of the profession and political reporters in particular. However, biographies of Cummings often overlook his brief journalism career at the Spectator. In 2006 the future prime ministerial aide left his position as the magazine’s online boss after he briefly published a cartoon on the Spectator’s website of the prophet Muhammad with a bomb in his turban, following the lead of a Danish newspaper which had prompted an international row about the limits of free speech. “I didn’t think it was a wise thing,” said the then acting editor Stuart Reid.
In another sign of the magazine’s role at the centre of a web of political connections, his departure was ultimately overseen by the Spectator chairman, Andrew Neil, who continues to hold the role at the Barclay Brothers-owned magazine in addition to his job as a BBC political interviewer. When Cummings was contacted by the Guardian in 2006 to clarify his role at the Spectator and the decision to publish the drawing, he said: “I have zero comment.” Fourteen years later, No 10 gave similar responses on his behalf to requests for comment from Guardian reporters on whether he had travelled to Durham during lockdown in late March. Wakefield has so far remained silent on the apparent lockdown breach, other than favouriting a number of supportive tweets suggesting the media were exaggerating the importance of the incident. A spokesperson for the Spectator, which has carried comment pieces arguing that Cummings must be sacked, said: “We are happy to let our coverage speak for itself.” One of the unanswered questions about the incident is why Cummings felt the need to check his eyesight by driving to Barnard Castle, rather than ask his wife to take the wheel on the long drive down the A1 back to London. Wakefield herself is known to have driven: the award-winning travel writing piece that helped her get the Spectator job describes her driving across Texas."
2020-05-28T03:05:26Z,politics,Politics,'Do YOUR duty': what the papers say about the Dominic Cummings crisis,"The fallout from Dominic Cummings trip to Durham continues to be splashed across the front pages, including the news that senior ministers are breaking ranks over the beleaguered advisor’s trip. The Guardian says “Tories defy PM to pile pressure on Cummings”, including 61 MPs who are refusing to heed Boris Johnson’s calls to “move on”. It says two of those condemning Cummings are government whips, in addition to Penny Mordaunt, now the paymaster general, who said there were “inconsistencies” in Cummings’ account of the trip.
The Guardian also gives prominence to Emily Maitlis, who was replaced as the BBC’s Newsnight presenter on Wednesday after a statement from the broadcaster said she broke impartiality rules on Tuesday’s programme, when she said Cummings broke the rules and: “the country can see that and is shocked the government cannot”. The programme’s editor, Esme Wren, wrote on Twitter that Maitlis “hasn’t been replaced tonight in response to the BBC statement”.
The FT’s headline is “Johnson brushes aside Cummings inquiry demands despite backlash”, quoting the PM saying it’s time to “move on”. Its sub headline is “Blame shifted for pandemic failings”.
The Telegraph also carries a large picture of Maitlis, with the headline: “Maitlis broke BBC rules with Cummings rant”. It saves its splash for “Public told they have ‘duty’ to test and trace”, with the government confirming its test-and-trace scheme will be voluntary. Cummings gets a mention from the paper’s political editor, Gordon Rayner, whose story is headlined online: “Boris Johnson says it is ‘time to move on’ as he rejects inquiry into Dominic Cummings”.
The Mirror, which jointly broke the Cummings story with the Guardian, still has Cummings squarely in its sights, picturing him on the front page with the PM and the headline: “Why don’t YOU do YOUR duty”. It says: “Government tells the public to do ‘civic duty’ to curb virus but PM still backs the aide who broke the rules”.
The Times also leads on the new test-and-trace policy: “Do your duty and we can defeat virus, Britain told”. But it reserves the right-hand column for the Newsnight presenter change: “BBC admits attack on Cummings broke rules”.
The Metro says Boris Johnson is “Zooming Fuming”, saying PM “sticks by Cummings as he’s grilled by furious MPs”.
The Daily Mail is Cummings-free on its front, instead splashing on the “Test & trace revolution”. It reports that anyone in close contact with a Covid-19 patient will be told to self-isolate for 14 days “even if the don’t have symptoms”.
The Express has “Test and Trace: Key to our freedom” and reports that health secretary, Matt Hancock, urges Britons to do their “civic duty” to “thwart the virus”.
The Sun goes its own way with “Ale meet again”, with the news that pubs are to “open in June”.
And finally, while strictly speaking not a newspaper front page, the New European’s headline is too good to ignore: “Nerd Immunity: why the PM risked everything to protect Cummings”."
2020-05-27T22:15:47Z,politics,Politics,Tory anger at Dominic Cummings grows as 61 MPs defy Boris Johnson,"More than 60 Conservative MPs have continued to defy Boris Johnson’s calls to “move on” from the Dominic Cummings crisis as a senior minister broke ranks to accuse the aide of inconsistencies in his account of his behaviour during lockdown. The intervention of Penny Mordaunt deepened the turmoil within government following revelations by the Guardian and Daily Mirror that Cummings had travelled 260 miles to his family estate in Durham with his wife suffering coronavirus symptoms. The former chancellor Sajid Javid also said the journey was not “necessary or justified” as the number of backbenchers calling for Cummings to resign or be sacked grew to 44, with a total of 61 Tory MPs weighing in to criticise him. Two of those condemning Cummings are government whips. Mordaunt, a former defence secretary who now holds the ministerial post of paymaster general, said there were “inconsistencies” in Cummings’ account and apologised for how recent days have “undermined key public health messages”. In an email sent to constituents, Mordaunt said Cummings’ continued position was a “matter for the prime minister” but she could “fully understand how angry people are” and believed there was no doubt he “took risks”.
Fury among Conservative MPs has grown by the day, after an investigation that also revealed how Cummings took his family on a 60-mile round trip to a beauty spot in Barnard Castle, which he says was to test whether his eyesight was good enough for him to drive back to London. At an appearance before the liaison committee of senior MPs, Johnson declined to answer most questions about Cummings, saying repeatedly it was time to “move on”. But his pleas fell flat as Javid, who stood down as chancellor after clashing with Cummings, joined the list of those criticising the No 10 aide. In a letter to a constituent reported by the Bromsgrove Standard, Javid said: “I do not believe Mr Cummings’ journey to County Durham to isolate on his family’s estate was necessary or justified. I remain unconvinced his visit to Barnard Castle could be considered reasonable. “I was also deeply concerned by his decision to return to Downing Street directly after coming into contact with a family member who was ill, potentially with coronavirus.”
Other Tories who were unconvinced either by Johnson’s appearance before the liaison committee or Cummings’ attempts to explain himself on Monday included the former minister George Freeman. Freeman, a former Downing Street policy chief for Theresa May, said he thought Cummings “had to go” after he received about 1,000 emails from constituents “expressing outrage at the PM’s chief of staff breaking the lockdown and not apologising” . He added: “It’s clear that public anger at the betrayal of their trust and compliance now risks a collapse of respect for [government] public health advice.” One backbencher, Giles Watling, tweeted: “I’ve been listening to the PM in the liaison committee. I applaud him for sticking by his man, but I’m afraid Mr Cummings should stand down. His continued presence at the heart of government at this time is an unwanted distraction.” Two government whips, responsible for discipline in the party, also made critical comments about Cummings to their constituents. Mike Freer, who is comptroller of the household, said he “certainly would not have taken the actions Mr Cummings did”, while Maria Caulfield, an assistant government whip and nurse who returned to care for Covid-19 patients, told one of her constituents that Cummings had done “untold damage to the spirit of the law”.
Mordaunt is the second and most senior government minister to have criticised Cummings, after Douglas Ross resigned as Scotland minister on Tuesday. “Other families have been faced with the same situation as Mr Cummings and chosen to stay put,” she wrote to constituents in a letter seen by the Guardian. “Despite Mr Cummings’ statement [on Monday], I am personally still not clear of the facts. There are some inconsistencies in his account of events and the reasons behind it. I am not clear about when he would have been symptomatic and on what dates he should have been in isolation. Or whether it was appropriate he drove home at the time he did.
“There is no doubt he took risks – refuelling at a petrol station is a risk to oneself and to others, which presumably he did. I understand there may have been other issues which would have made other options to care for his child in London impossible. “What is clear is that the scenes of the last few days will have undermined key public health messages. I deeply regret this and am very sorry for it.” The former defence secretary said people were “reasonable and sympathetic” about the difficult choices facing families and highlighted that the public may not know all the reasons why other courses of action were not open to him. But she added: “In all of this though is also our obligations to others too. It is because of that shared responsibility and the public making those sacrifices that we have reduced the infection rate. The rules and those obligations apply to all of us. We cannot thank people enough for all they have done. “Perhaps my deepest regret in all of this is that it must be a distraction to efforts to combat coronavirus and the many other issues the government is still having to deal with. So much else has happened in the last few days, including a serious incursion by China into India.”
Mordaunt does not call for Cummings to resign in her letter, and it is understood she is not demanding that he goes. Her letter was sent in her capacity as a constituency MP, rather than as a government minister. But her comments are the most critical to come from a senior member of Johnson’s team. Late on Wednesday the former home secretary Amber Rudd joined the dozens of Conservatives calling on Cummings to go. The former MP told ITV’s Peston: “He should quit because he’s making things worse. People have been great during the lockdown. In a really difficult period, they have complied. And now they’re confused and that makes them angry and I think that will have consequences. “So when he thinks, as any of us working in government must, ‘am I adding here, am I helping?’ he can only conclude that his presence is making things worse at a time when we’re already in a crisis.” Johnson and most of his cabinet ministers have stood behind Cummings, saying his actions were legal and reasonable, and something that any father would do out of concern for their child’s welfare. Danny Kruger, a former No 10 aide and new Conservative MP, raised the stakes in Cummings’ defence by telling colleagues in a note that demands for his resignation were tantamount to a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. At the liaison committee, Johnson said he had seen evidence proving some of the allegations made against Cummings are false, but he refused to publish that evidence or hand it over to the cabinet secretary. His chief adviser has strenuously denied claims he returned to Durham on 19 April, in what would have been another potential breach of the guidelines on travelling.
But Johnson refused calls by the chair of the public accounts committee, Meg Hillier, to release that evidence to the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, or for it to be published. Johnson said: “I think, actually, that it would not be doing my job if I were now to shuffle this problem into the hands of officials who, as I think the public would want, working flat out to deal with coronavirus.” Johnson has also sought to blame the media for misreporting of Cummings’ actions, despite No 10 having weeks to respond to allegations against him. One senior cabinet source told the Guardian that they disagreed with the prime minister’s attacks on the media for pursuing the Cummings story, saying the press should not be blamed for doing its job.
Attempting to defuse public anger, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, said on Tuesday that anyone could do the same as Cummings in similar circumstances, even though his actions have provoked uproar, with polls suggesting that the majority of people believe he should resign. “If there are no other options, if you don’t have ready access to childcare, then you can do as Dominic Cummings chose to do,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. However, Jenrick said it was not possible for any fines already issued to people for driving to seek childcare to be reviewed, contrary to suggestions from Matt Hancock, the health secretary, on Tuesday. “There isn’t going to be a formal review. It’s for the police to decide whether to impose fines under the law,” Jenrick said."
2020-05-27T21:41:19Z,politics,Politics,Floundering Boris leaves no doubt: our PM is a showman out of his depth | John Crace,"We’ve reached the point where the only way to understand the state the country is in is to realise that it has become a banana republic. A failed state run by a bad joke of a prime minister, who prioritises the job security of his elite advisers over the health of millions. A man who sees no need to be across the most basic points of government policy and is so inarticulate that he can’t even start a sentence let alone finish one. It’s normal for a prime minister to appear before the liaison committee – the supergroup of select committee chairs – at least three times a year. This was the first time Boris Johnson had bothered to turn up in more than 10 months. And you could see why. Even with Dominic Cummings sitting just off screen – Boris’s eyes kept darting to the right, desperate for help – holding up placards with something approximating an answer, Johnson was lost for words. The great populist who doesn’t even realise he has long since lost the support of the people. A mini-dictator surrounded by yes men locked inside the No 10 bunker. What made this even more pathetic and desperate a spectacle was that Boris clearly believed he had prepared thoroughly. If he had, then his short-term memory is completely shot. More likely though, Boris’s idea of preparation is just a quick 10-minute skim of a briefing note.
Boris is the supreme narcissist – the apogee of entitled arrogance in which other people are there only to serve his needs. A fragile ego, disguising an absence of any self worth.What’s more, you sense he knows it. That in the wee, wee hours he looks through a glass darkly and sees the blurred outlines of his limitations and failure. The session started with questions from committee chair, Bernard Jenkin, and Boris was clearly expecting friendly fire. Only to many people’s surprise – possibly even his own – Bernie turned out to be no patsy. Instead he went straight to the point. Why was there to be no cabinet secretary inquiry into Dominic Cummings’s clear breach of the government coronavirus guidelines. “Um... er... well,” Boris blustered looking frantically to Classic Dom for help. Up went the placard ‘It’s time to move on.’ “Um... er... well ... I think what the country wants is to move on,” he said. What the opinion polls have clearly shown is that at least 70% of the country think that Laughing Boy is basically taking the piss – one rule for the elites, another for the little people. Only Boris somehow ignored that, believing that he knew better what the people really thought than they did. Who would have guessed that Boris would have subscribed to the Marxist idea of false consciousness? Six times Boris insisted that the country wanted to move on. Something I’m sure the families of those who have died – not to mention the many thousands who could yet die as the prime minister trashed his own public health message to protect a chum – must have been delighted to hear. Pete Wishart, Meg Hillier and Yvette Cooper all went in for the kill. Had Boris actually seen the evidence that Cummings had provided for his special and different Covid-19 fortnight away on his father’s estate? Boris nodded fiercely. He had. And the evidence was that it was Dom who was running the country and he didn’t have the power to sack him.
Nor could he explain the difference between deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries’s clear instructions to stay at home and the supine advice of several cabinet ministers who had insisted that maybe having to look after your own child constituted exceptional circumstances. Boris’s best guess was that maybe Harries hadn’t been as clear as he would have liked her to be and he hoped that she would come on message in the near future. He ended the section on Cummings by insisting that all the stories that Dom had corroborated in his rose garden press conference were essentially false. Things didn’t improve when Jenkin moved on to other areas of the government’s handling of the coronavirus. Boris had only the sketchiest idea of how the new track and trace system that was meant to come in to operation the following day would work. A nation panicked. He even said he was forbidden from making any promises on dates for reaching government targets. Let that sink in. The prime minister is forbidden from making his own policy. If we had been in any doubt who was running the country we weren’t any more. Boris didn’t even know the basics of how his own benefits system operated. This was Government 101 and the prime minister was still out of his depth. During the worst health crisis for a century we are lions led by dead donkeys."
2020-05-27T18:45:34Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson's liaison committee appearance: what did we learn?,"Boris Johnson endured a long and sometimes difficult first appearance before the liaison committee of senior MPs. Here’s some of the things we learned: He doesn’t want an investigation into Dominic Cummings The first long section of the appearance was dominated by questions about the apparent breach of lockdown regulations by Johnson’s chief adviser, and the PM could hardly have been less keen to engage, saying several times that people should “move on”. Johnson also declined to order an investigation into the matter by the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, or to share evidence about what Cummings may or may not have done. Johnson said he did not want to “shuffle this into the hands of officials”. He did say several times that “a lot” of the media coverage of the affair had been false, but when invited to set out what had been wrong, Johnson said he did not wish to discuss this. The two-metre distancing rule could be relaxed Asked about this by the Tory MP Greg Clark, who chairs the science and technology committee, the prime minister said he hoped it could be reduced, which would aid public transport, and pubs and restaurants. “My own hope is that as we make progress in getting the virus down, in reducing the incidence, we will be able to reduce that distance, which I think will be particularly valuable in transport and clearly the hospitality sector,” he said.
When Clark asked if he could instruct the government’s Sage scientific advisory committee to look into the issue, Johnson said: “I cannot only make that commitment, I can tell you I’ve already done just that.” He seems uncertain about the ‘no recourse to public funds’ rule No recourse to public funds, or NRPF, is a condition placed on some people who enter the UK from other countries and have a temporary immigration status, which means you can’t claim most benefits. It has faced new scrutiny amid the Covid-19 outbreak, with many people out of work. Stephen Timms, the Labour MP who chairs the work and pensions committee, told Johnson about a family with two children in his East Ham constituency who faced “destitution” after the father lost his job, with the mother’s income being less than their rent. “They have leave to remain in the UK but no recourse to public funds, so they can’t get any help at all,” Timms said. Apparently unclear about how NRPF operates, Johnson asked why they were not eligible for benefits like universal credit, with Timms having to explain their situation again, and what NRPF involves. Johnson said he would look at how the scheme works: “You’ve raised a very, very important point if a condition of their leave to remain is that they should have no recourse to public funds. I will find out how many there are in that position, and we will see what we can do to help.” Test, track and trace did not happen at first due to lack of testing This has been strongly hinted at before by government scientific advisers, but answering questions from Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who now chairs the health committee, Johnson was very open. “We did have a test, track and trace operation but unfortunately we did not have the capacity in Public Health England,” he said. “To be absolutely blunt, we didn’t have the enzymes, we didn’t have the test kits, we just didn’t have the volume, nor did we have enough experienced trackers ready to mount the kind of operation they did in some other east Asian countries, for instance,” he said. He would like more women at the daily Covid-19 press conferences Quizzed by Caroline Nokes, the Tory MP who chairs the women and equalities committee, Johnson said: “It’s certainly true that I would have liked to have had more female representation at the press conferences so far.” Asked by Nokes how many women would be “enough” representation, Johnson appeared to laugh, and was reprimanded by Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative who chairs the liaison committee, who reminded him this was a serious matter. While some of the scientists at the press conferences have been women, among the ministers, only the home secretary, Priti Patel, has appeared on occasions."
2020-05-27T18:10:27Z,politics,Politics,Former Tory donor's housing project 'unlawfully approved to avoid £40m hit',"The housing secretary knew that a billionaire former media tycoon had only 24 hours to have an east London property development approved before community charges were imposed that would have cost him over £40m. Robert Jenrick’s accepted that his approval of one-time Conservative-supporting billionaire Richard Desmond’s project at the Isle of Dogs was unlawful. Documents related to the consent order for the development show that the minister was aware that a council-imposed community infrastructure levy (CIL) would have been introduced on 15 January this year. Against the advice of his own planning inspector, the minister gave the go-ahead for the construction of more than 1,500 apartments in a 44-storey complex on 14 January. Jenrick’s decision was made just 24 hours before the Tower Hamlets CIL would have cost Desmond at least £40m. CILs were to be used to tax large property developments at £280 per square metre with the cash raised channelled back into the council area for building schools and health clinics. Point four of the consent order relating to the project states: “In pre-action correspondence, pursuant to the duty of candour, the first defendant explained the DL[decision letter] was issued on 14 January 2020 so that it would be issued before the claimant [Tower Hamlets] adopt its new local plan and CIL charging schedule.” A Conservative critic who has resigned from the Tories over the issue said he believed the document proved that the minister took his decision “deliberately before” the council charges would have been imposed on Desmond’s Northern & Shell. “This drove the timing of the decision in my opinion,” Tower Hamlets councillor Andrew Wood told the Guardian. “Point four of the order now makes that explicit.” A spokesperson for the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government denied any favouritism towards Desmond’s proposed property development at the site of a former printworks. “While we reject the suggestion that there was any actual bias in the decision, we have agreed that the application will be redetermined,” the ministry spokesperson added. While welcoming the decision to put a freeze on the planning decision, Wood said giving the green light to the project would result in the “further Manhattan-isation of the Isle of Dogs, leading to residential building heights and densities not to be found elsewhere in the UK.”
Tower Hamlets council took legal action against the minister, claiming the timing of Jenrick’s decision appeared to show bias towards the former owner of the Star, Daily Express and Sunday Express. The council asked the court to order the government to disclose all correspondence between the minister and government officials about the decision. The minister accepted this decision letter did show “apparent bias” and recused himself from any future decisions over Desmond’s project. One of those who had raised objections to the plans was the ministry’s own planning inspection officer who pointed out that the development would damage views of Tower Bridge. Alongside the consent order, Wood has put in a freedom of information request for all the correspondence between officials and the minister relating to the Westferry Road printworks development. “I think Robert Jenrick needs to publish all correspondence between himself and the developer Northern & Shell, and that it should be investigated by the appropriate authorities given the amount of money at stake,” Wood added. “The key question is: why did he make the decision when he did so against the inspector’s advice?” Desmond sold his the Express and Star titles two years ago. The 68-year-old billionaire’s company Northern & Shell, which is behind the Isle of Dogs development, donated £10,000 to the Conservatives in 2017 and £1m to Ukip in 2015."
2020-05-27T16:35:25Z,politics,Politics,"'Inconsistencies' in Dominic Cummings' story, says senior Tory","Penny Mordaunt, a senior government minister, has said there are “inconsistencies” in Dominic Cummings’ account of his actions during lockdown and apologised for how recent days have “undermined key public health messages”. In an email sent to constituents, seen by the Guardian, Mordaunt said Cummings’ continued position as Boris Johnson’s chief adviser was a “matter for the prime minister” but she also said she could “fully understand how angry people are” and believed there was no doubt he “took risks”. The Cabinet Office minister, whose official title is paymaster general, is the second and most senior government minister to have criticised Cummings, after Douglas Ross resigned as Scotland Office minister on Tuesday. “Other families have been faced with the same situation as Mr Cummings and chosen to stay put,” she wrote to constituents, after the Guardian and Daily Mirror revealed that the aide travelled 260 miles from London to his family’s farm in Durham when his wife had suspected coronavirus symptoms. “Despite Mr Cummings’ statement yesterday, I am personally still not clear of the facts.

Mordaunt’s letter was sent in her capacity as a constituency MP, rather than as a government minister. But her comments are the most critical to come from a senior member of Johnson’s team. More than 40 Tory MPs have now called on Cummings to resign or be sacked and many more have expressed their anger in private to government. David Simmonds and George Freeman were the latest to express their view that Cummings should go, in messages to their constituents on Wednesday. However, Johnson and his cabinet ministers have stood behind Cummings, saying his actions were legal and reasonable – something that any father would do out of concern for their child’s welfare.
Attempting to defuse public anger, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, said on Tuesday that anyone could do the same as Cummings in similar circumstances, even though his actions have provoked uproar, with polls suggesting that the majority of people believe he should resign. “If there are no other options, if you don’t have ready access to childcare, then you can do as Dominic Cummings chose to do,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

The controversy was ignited last week when the Guardian and Mirror revealed that Cummings had driven across England with his wife and four-year-old son fearing that they may have contracted Covid-19, in order to seek possible childcare.
After his 14-day quarantine period, Cummings took his family on a 60-mile round trip to a beauty spot in Barnard Castle, which he says was to test whether his eyesight was good enough for him to drive back to London on 13 April. More Tory MPs went public on Tuesday night and Wednesday with calls for Cummings to resign, while three of the party’s new County Durham MPs – Richard Holden, Dehenna Davison and Paul Howell – said none of them would have taken the same decision and acknowledged that the “continuing situation is creating a major distraction”.
As Johnson was questioned on Cummings at the liaison committee, Giles Watling, the MP for Clacton, tweeted: “I’ve been listening to the PM in the liaison committee. I applaud him for sticking by his man but I’m afraid Mr Cummings should stand down. His continued presence at the heart of government at this time is an unwanted distraction.” In Cummings’ defence, Danny Kruger, a former No 10 aide and new Conservative MP, raised the stakes by telling colleagues in a note that demands for resignation were tantamount to a vote of no confidence in the prime minister."
2020-05-27T16:33:42Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson grilled by MPs over Dominic Cummings’ lockdown breach,"Boris Johnson has again refused to apologise for breaches of coronavirus lockdown rules by Dominic Cummings, telling a committee of senior MPs that political bickering was to blame for any confusion over distancing rules, rather than the actions of his chief adviser. In an often fractious appearance before the Commons liaison committee, the prime minister declined to answer most questions about Cummings, saying repeatedly it was time to “move on”. Johnson also claimed that when it came to coverage of Cummings’ 260-mile trip to Durham with his family when he feared he had Covid, and subsequent 60-mile round trip to a local beauty spot, “a lot of the allegations turned out to be totally false”. The prime minister did not say which claims were false. Asked later in the session to explain what was false, Johnson refused, saying: “I have really nothing to add on what I’ve previously said.” Asked by several MPs on the committee, which brings together the chairs of various subject-specific select committees, whether he was sorry for Cummings’ actions and the possible impact they might have on the future compliance of the public with lockdown rules, Johnson ducked the question. Instead, he expressed regret only for the situation caused to many families by lockdown. “Of course, I am sorry for the pain, the anguish and the heartbreak of so many people in this country,” he said.
Johnson refused to be drawn on still-unexplained aspects of Cummings’ travels, referring to his adviser’s highly unusual press conference from the rose garden of Downing Street on Monday. “We’ve had quite a lot of autobiography recently,” Johnson told the committee chair, the Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin. “I’ve commented on it, I think people know my views. I really don’t propose to add to it.” The prime minister faced generally hostile questioning from the cross-party group of MPs. Some came from Simon Hoare, the Tory MP for North Dorset, who told Johnson he feared future lockdown rules would be less rigorously adhered to “as a direct result of the activities of your senior adviser”. Hoare said: “You’re right to say we know what your views are. Frankly, I don’t think anybody understands why you hold those views. So what do we say to our constituents, who are likely to say, you can keep your lockdown if it has to come back. If other people don’t have to abide by it, why on earth should we?” Johnson replied: “I must say, I don’t think that’s true about how the British people will respond to the next phases, to how to work the test-and-trace system.” The most fiery exchanges came with Labour’s Yvette Cooper, who asked the prime minister whether all parents with suspected Covid and worries about childcare if they fell ill could now travel freely. Johnson replied: “If you have exceptional problems with childcare, you can vary your arrangements, that’s clear.” Pressed on this, he said: “I think you’d have to look at each individual case.” Cooper accused Johnson of “putting your political concerns ahead of clear public health messages” to protect Cummings. She said: “We need you to get this right, now. So can you tell us – you have a choice between protecting Dominic Cummings and putting the national interest first. Which will it be, prime minister?”
Johnson responded by intimating it was such questions that were confusing the public, and not Cummings’ actions. “This conversation has, to my mind, illuminated why it’s so important for us to move on and be very clear with the British public about how we want. Frankly, when they hear nothing but politicians squabbling and bickering, it’s no wonder that they feel confused.” The prime minister was openly mocked by Pete Wishart of the Scottish National party, who started his questioning by saying: “I actually think that you’ve been quite brave. The way that you’ve been prepared to sacrifice the credibility and popularity of your own government, just to stand by your man.”
On specific questions, Johnson said he had not asked the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, the country’s most senior civil servant, to investigate whether Cummings had broken any rules. “Quite frankly, I’m not certain right now, that an inquiry into that matter is a very good use of official time,” he told Jenkin. Asked repeatedly by Labour’s Meg Hillier if he had seen evidence from Cummings that backed up his version of events, Johnson eventually said he had, but said he was not going to show this to Sedwill. He said: “It would not be doing my job if I were now to shuffle this problem into the hands of officials.”"
2020-05-27T16:18:05Z,politics,Politics,Government accused of cronyism after ex-Tory MPs given tourism roles,"Two former Conservative MPs have been appointed to senior tourism jobs despite an apparent lack of direct experience in the sector, prompting accusations of cronyism within government. Sir Patrick McLoughlin and Nick de Bois have been given roles at the British Tourist Authority and VisitEngland respectively, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said on Wednesday. McLoughlin, who stepped down as an MP at December’s election, has been made chair of the BTA board, which is the ultimate governing body of VisitBritain, the UK’s main national tourism quango. The role pays £40,000 a year for an average of two days a week. McLoughlin was an MP for 33 years, firstly for West Derbyshire and then the newly created constituency of Derbyshire Dales. A former miner, he held a series of ministerial posts. While one of these roles was transport secretary, McLoughlin does not appear to have direct experience of the tourism industry. That contrasts with his immediate predecessor, Steve Ridgway, a former chief executive of Virgin Atlantic who also ran his own travel company, owned a hotel and chaired a ferry company. De Bois held the Enfield North seat from 2010 to 2015, and was later chief of staff for Dominic Raab, when he was Brexit secretary. Aside from politics, his background is in the events and exhibitions sector. He has been made chair of the VisitEngland advisory board, another part-time role, which will pay up to £16,320 a year for a maximum of four days work a month on a three-year contract. De Bois also replaces a person with extensive tourism experience. Denis Wormwell had spent 30 years in the travel, hospitality and transport sectors, including co-owning Club 18-30, setting up an airline, and running the now-defunct holiday group Shearings. Ridgway and Wormwell were both appointed in 2017 for three-year terms. Labour said the selection of McLoughlin and De Bois appeared to show clear favouritism. The MP Ben Bradshaw, a former culture secretary, said: “By handing out plush appointments like these to former Tory MPs with little relevant experience, the government are furthering the impression they believe it’s one rule for them and their chums, another for the British public.” The appointments come at a critical time for the UK tourism and heritage sector, which have been severely hit by the coronavirus pandemic and will suffer even more from a planned mandatory 14-day quarantine period for people arriving in the UK. Speaking to the Commons culture, media and sport committee last week, Patricia Yates, the acting chief executive of VisitBritain, said the tourism sector expected to lose £37bn from the impact of Covid-19. VisitBritain has predicted there will be a £15bn drop in income from overseas visitors. A government spokeswoman said: “Both roles were filled through fair and open competitions, regulated by the commissioner for public appointments, in accordance with the governance code for public appointments. “Candidates were assessed by an independent advisory panel who found that both Patrick McLoughlin and Nick de Bois had the relevant experience and skills to meet the requirements of their roles.”"
2020-05-27T12:12:11Z,politics,Politics,Coronavirus wage subsidies costing UK Treasury £22bn,"A third of the British workforce is receiving wage subsidies at a cost of almost £22bn to the Treasury, according to the latest government figures. HMRC said that 1m employers had claimed £15bn for 8.4 million furloughed employees under the coronavirus rescue scheme between 20 April and 24 May. Another 2.3 million self employed workers have made claims under a separate self-employment income support scheme at a cost of £6.8bn. The combined total of 10.7 million workers represents a third of the UK’s 32 million-strong workforce that must stay at home and not work under the rules of furlough scheme, in which the government pays 80% of a workers’ wages up to £2,500 a month, until the end of July. Rishi Sunak has won praise for implementing the two subsidy schemes covering employed and self-employed workers after studies showed that at least half the people covered would otherwise have been made redundant. He has committed the government to extend the furlough scheme in some form until the end of October, but is not expected to reveal details until at least the end of this week. Employers are braced for an end to the £2,500 subsidy for non-working staff and its replacement with a smaller subsidy that forces them to bring back workers part-time. Employers groups have warned that a cliff edge at the end of July will lead to tens of thousands of redundancies. The draft plans are understood to expect employers to contribute 20% of salaries while the government pays 60% up to a cap of 2,500 a month, down from the 80% employers receive at present. Employers will also be expected to pay national insurance contributions, which they are currently exempt from. The chancellor is also considering shutting the furlough scheme to new entrants, a move that will cap the bill to the Treasury, but also prevent employers from rotating staff who are currently not working with those who have spent recent weeks at work. A study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies forecast that scheme would cost around £80bn by the end of October. Simon Rothenberg, a senior manager at the accountants Blick Rothenberg, said the government’s plans to widen the job retention scheme to include part-time working could see widespread abuse and fraud.
“With the widening of the job retention scheme to include part-time working, the temptation for employers to exaggerate claims, especially in times when they need cash desperately, is likely to increase.” He added: “This will make HMRC’s job in policing the scheme and auditing claims even harder and more time consuming, particularly for those working remotely.” The Treasury has already become concerned at the potential for fraud after hundreds of complaints from employees that they have been made to work while their employer claimed the furlough subsidy."
2020-05-27T10:57:32Z,politics,Politics,Anti-porn filters stop Dominic Cummings trending on Twitter,"Twitter’s anti-porn filters have blocked Dominic Cummings’ name from its list of trending topics despite Boris Johnson’s chief adviser dominating British political news for almost a week, the Guardian can reveal. As a result of the filtering, trending topics over the past five days have instead included a variety of misspellings of his name, including #cummnings, #dominiccummigs and #sackcummimgs, as well as his first name on its own, the hashtag #sackdom, and the place names Durham, County Durham and Barnard Castle. The filter also affects suggested hashtags, meaning users who tried to type #dominiccummings were instead presented with one of the misspelled variations to auto-complete, helping them trend instead. This sort of accidental filtering has gained a name in computer science: the Scunthorpe problem, so-called because of the Lincolnshire town’s regular issues with such censorship.
Bizarrely, the shortened hashtag #cumgate has also trended, since the first syllable is not included in Twitter’s filter list, apparently in an attempt to avoid the Scunthorpe problem applying too broadly – for instance, by blocking words such as “scum”, “cumbersome” or “cumulative”. Although Twitter does not publish the contents of the word filter list, users can check whether a particular term is blocked from trending by searching for it. By default, the site blocks all photo and video results from search terms it believes may contain sensitive content, meaning a media search for “porn” or “Cummings” will, unless the search filters are turned off, return zero results. Twitter declined to comment on the filtering. The company’s opaque trending algorithms have regularly led to accusations of interference, as users conclude that the absence of a particular topic is a sign of malicious intent, but the answer is rarely as straightforward as it is in this case. Typically, topics trend due to marked deviations from a baseline of interest. That means it can be hard for a topic to trend if it is always under discussion – explaining why the company’s products do not constantly report trends for K-pop and Donald Trump. That requirement also ensures continuing novelty in trending topics by raising the threshold for each successive period, so a topic that suddenly becomes the centre of attention will not monopolise the list for weeks or months. Unfortunately for Cummings, the regular revelations – and inventive misspellings – mean new trending topics have arrived each day, with Saturday’s #sackcummimgs giving way to Tuesday’s “Barnard Castle Eye Test” and Wednesday’s “Dim and Dom”."
2020-05-27T09:06:12Z,politics,Politics,"Parents free to relocate to seek childcare like Cummings did, says minister","Everyone can drive across the country and relocate their households to seek childcare in the same way that Dominic Cummings did, a cabinet minister has said, but there will be no review of fines imposed on people who have done that before now. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, said people could do the same as Cummings, even though his actions have provoked uproar, with up to 40 Conservative MPs calling for him to resign and surveys showing most of the public think he was wrong. “If there are no other options, if you don’t have ready access to childcare, then you can do as Dominic Cummings chose to do,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Jenrick said it was not possible for any fines already issued to people for driving to seek childcare to be reviewed, contrary to suggestions from Matt Hancock, the health secretary, on Tuesday. “There isn’t going to be a formal review. It’s for the police to decide whether to impose fines under the law,” Jenrick said. The controversy was ignited last week when the Guardian and Mirror revealed that Cummings had driven across England to his parents’ estate in Durham fearing that he and his wife may have contracted coronavirus, in order to seek possible childcare for their four-year-old child. After his 14-day quarantine period, Cummings took his family on a 60-mile round trip to a beauty spot in Barnard Castle, which he says was to test whether his eyesight was good enough for him to drive back to London. Despite polls showing that the public want Cummings to resign for breaching the lockdown, Jenrick continued to insist that the prime minister’s aide had done nothing wrong, and he called for people to “move on” from the row. “Dominic Cummings didn’t break the guidelines, the police haven’t chosen, as far as I’m aware, to impose a fine upon him, and so I think we have to leave it there,” he said. More Tory MPs went public on Tuesday night and Wednesday with calls for Cummings to resign, while three of the party’s new County Durham MPs – Richard Holden, Dehenna Davison and Paul Howell – said none of them would have taken the same decision and acknowledged that the “continuing situation is creating a major distraction”. In Cummings’ defence, Danny Kruger, a former No 10 aide and new Conservative MP, raised the stakes by telling colleagues in a note that demands for resignation were tantamount to a vote of no confidence in the prime minister.
Nadhim Zahawi, another Tory MP, was reported by Sky to have been circulating focus-group research that purports to show that while the story about Cummings “has traction, it hasn’t ignited passions” and that some people are becoming “increasingly annoyed with the wall-to-wall coverage”. The government will continue to seek to draw a line under the controversy on Wednesday, with Hancock unveiling some more details of how a new track-and-trace system to bear down on local outbreaks will work. It is likely to involve very localised lockdowns of schools, hospitals, housing estates or parts of towns that see flare-ups. Jenrick told LBC: “If we can get our track-, trace-and-test system set up across the country, if there is a flare-up in a particular community, or somewhere that’s even more micro than that like a school or workplace, [or] hospital, then we’ll be able to ask those people who’ve come into close contact with the individuals who’ve got the virus to stay at home, to self-isolate for a short period of time.”"
2020-05-27T06:10:40Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings: Tory unrest increases pressure on PM to sack adviser,"Boris Johnson faced an extraordinary and growing revolt from within his own party on Tuesday over his refusal to sack his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, for breaching lockdown rules. On a day of dramatic developments, a junior minister resigned and more than 30 other Conservative MPs called for Cummings to go, many citing inboxes overflowing with hundreds of angry messages from constituents. A further eight Tory MPs were publicly critical of the senior aide’s actions, and three said privately that he should be forced out. Downing Street had hoped Monday’s lengthy statement from Cummings in the rose garden of No 10 would convince the public he had acted as any concerned father would in driving 260 miles to his parents’ property in Durham when his wife was experiencing potential coronavirus symptoms.
But in a snap YouGov poll, 71% of respondents said they thought Cummings had broken the rules, and 59% that he should resign – up seven percentage points from three days earlier. Forty-six per cent of Tory voters and 52% of leave voters said he should quit. A separate YouGov survey for the Times suggested the Conservative lead over Keir Starmer’s Labour party has been cut by nine points in a week: the sharpest fall for a decade. The poll put the Tories on 44% and Labour on 38%. As the number of excess deaths registered in the UK during the Covid-19 outbreak reached nearly 60,000, and an international comparison confirmed the country has one of the world’s highest rates of coronavirus deaths per capita, the Downing Street press briefing was dominated by questions about Cummings for a fourth consecutive day. It follows an investigation by the Guardian and Daily Mirror revealing Cummings’ previously secret trips to and around north-east England in late March and early April. Douglas Ross, the MP for Moray who stepped down as a Scotland Office minister, said that although he accepted Cummings had acted with his family’s best interests at heart, “Mr Cummings’ interpretation of the government advice was not shared by the vast majority of people who have done as the government asked”. He added: “I have constituents who didn’t get to say goodbye to loved ones; families who could not mourn together; people who didn’t visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government. I cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right.”
Cummings insisted a caveat about parents looking after young children legitimised his decision to drive to Durham, saying: “The guidance says you don’t have to just sit there.” The prime minister has staunchly defended his most senior aide, whose advice was critical in sweeping the Conservatives to an 80-seat majority, with the “Get Brexit done” slogan, at December’s general election. Significant revolts are rare at such an early stage after a thumping election victory, but Cummings was already a divisive figure and his refusal to apologise for an apparent breach of the rules appears to have touched a nerve with the lockdown-weary public. Calls for him to go came from across the spectrum of the Conservative party on Tuesday. They included the former chief whip Mark Harper, who said there was “no credible justification” for the drive to local beauty spot Barnard Castle, apparently to test whether Cummings’ eyesight was good enough to make the drive back to the capital.
The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt released the text of a reply to a constituent, in which he said of Cummings: “What he did was a clear breach of the lockdown rules” – though Hunt did not call for him to resign, saying: “You do make mistakes in these situations.” Four more former ministers – Steve Baker, Harriett Baldwin, Stephen Hammond and Jackie Doyle-Price – all called for Cummings to go. The veteran Brexiter Peter Bone said he had not been reassured by Monday’s statement. “The rose garden interview just confirmed to me that he had driven up to Durham when we were in a strict lockdown. He absolutely should resign,” he said. “I have 400 emails from people and I’m sitting here with my colleague going through every one, and we’d rather be doing some case work but we just have so many people to reply to.” Johnson loyalists continued to defend the embattled adviser on Tuesday, however. Cummings’ longtime political friend and former boss Michael Gove gave a series of supportive interviews, insisting the Barnard Castle side trip was wise. “I think he was wise to make sure he was comfortable before driving back down to London on the A1, an inevitably busier road,” he told Sky News. Gove also said: “It is the case it was part of the National Police Chiefs’ Council’s guidance that you could drive at that time to take exercise as well.” However, the rules on exercise were only relaxed after Cummings was back in London.
Later, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who is the minister responsible for the lockdown regulations, repeated his own defence of Cummings, insisting: “My view is that what he did was within the guidelines.” Asked why he himself had stayed put when he and his wife were ill with the virus, Hancock told the Downing Street press briefing bluntly: “We had childcare readily available at home, and Mr Cummings didn’t.” But Hancock was blindsided by a question from a vicar in Brighton about whether members of the public who had been fined for travelling during the lockdown could have them reviewed if they were travelling for childcare reasons. “It’s a very good question and we do understand the impact and the need for making sure that children get adequate childcare, that is one of the significant concerns that we have had all the way through this,” he said.
He then said he would speak to colleagues at the Treasury about the issue. Government sources later insisted he had not intended to promise a review, and it would be looked into by the Home Office. Downing Street has not yet announced a replacement for Ross – and could struggle to find another supportive Scottish Tory MP. The party’s leader in Scotland, Jackson Carlaw, who is an MSP, told the BBC on Tuesday that the Cummings “furore” was a distraction, and if he were Cummings, he would “be considering my position”. During his briefing on Monday, Cummings insisted he had not considered resigning and did not regret his various journeys – though he did concede that perhaps he should have discussed his whereabouts with the prime minister at an earlier stage. He said Johnson found out a few days later, but nothing was made public. Labour sought to pile the pressure on Johnson, with the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, writing to her Conservative opposite number, Rishi Sunak, to ask if the government has modelled the risks of declining compliance with the lockdown rules. Without mentioning Cummings by name, she said she was “deeply concerned that the last 48 hours have presented a confused picture” about whether those experiencing symptoms should self-isolate."
2020-05-27T00:29:19Z,politics,Politics,"Who is Dominic Cummings, and why has his lockdown car trip convulsed UK politics?","The Rose Garden at 10 Downing Street is normally reserved for British prime ministers to make set-piece announcements. But on Monday it was the scene of epic political theatre when Boris Johnson’s Svengali-like aide Dominic Cummings sat down and explained to a frenzied British media pack why he had broken the Covid-19 lockdown rules – or not. The scene tells us a great deal about the country’s politics in the first two decades of the 21st century. Cummings is the embodiment of the bewildering change that has transformed the country from clubbable member of the globalised world into a reckless, Brexit-voting outlier that is now enduring the biggest failure of statecraft since the 1930s. But how did an unelected adviser get to be the most powerful person in the UK after the prime minister? And what will his uncomfortable moment in the spotlight mean for Britain’s immediate future? Who is Dominic Cummings? Starting with his portrayal by Benedict Cumberbatch in a TV drama about his triumphant leadership of the Brexit campaign, Cummings has seeped slowly into the public consciousness. However, he remained a slightly mysterious figure to most Britons outside political circles until this weekend.
To some extent, Cummings can be seen as a typical Oxford-educated Tory toff. But although he was privately educated, still a fundamental fault line in British society, you won’t find him posing in toff-tastic Oxford Bullingdon Club photographs like Johnson and former Tory prime minister David Cameron. Cummings, the son of a mining engineer and a special needs teacher, grew up in County Durham in north-east England. Cummings eschewed Durham’s prevailing leftwing politics when he was growing up, instead championing the region’s nemesis, Margaret Thatcher, during the bitter miners’ strike of the 1980s (an academic Billy Elliott he was not). He is remembered by university contemporaries and tutors as an outsider who was incredibly sharp. The bookish student was said to be a favourite of the rightwing history professor Norman Stone. Another of his teachers, the history don Robin Lane Fox, was once asked who was smarter, Johnson or Cummings. He replied: “Dominic, by a long way. Different class altogether.” After leaving Oxford with a first in ancient and modern history, he spent three years in post-Soviet Russia before drifting into Conservative party politics as a kind of intellectual provocateur seemingly on a mission to upset the establishment.
What has he done to British politics? Cummings found his political mojo in 2004, when the then Labour government wanted to introduce regional assemblies. Taking his deeply entrenched dislike for officialdom, he turned the campaign about whether the north should have its own political voice into a simpler one about money. His idea to hire a giant inflatable white elephant and parade it around the region as a symbol of what the assembly would become struck a chord with voters. What had seemed like a nailed-on win for the yes campaign became a resounding no, arguably setting the template for the type of Cummings cunning that would carry the day in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Before he got there, however, Cummings had reached Whitehall in the early 2010s as special adviser to then education secretary, Michael Gove. Cummings’ open contempt for civil service conventions made him a polarising figure, so much so that the prime minister, Cameron, described him as a “career psychopath”. But while the suave Cameron was sleepwalking into Brexit, Cummings was setting out his political manifesto in his now-famous blog. This prodigiously ambitious collection of ruminations attempts to describe how science – everything from Newtonian physics to epidemiology – could be used to improve governance and public policy, sweeping away what he sees as the amateurish, arts-educated civil service and replacing it with cleverer technocrats with degrees in maths and engineering. His approach helped harness popular disillusionment with the political class to triumph in the 2016 Brexit referendum, and his emergence as Johnson’s top adviser has handed him the chance to swing the Conservative party behind a radical rightwing agenda and reform the entire political system, even advertising earlier this year for “weirdos and misfits” to apply for jobs at No 10. What happened in the lockdown? The coronavirus has torn through the UK killing more than 37,000 people, blindsiding a political class that has appeared underpreprared, complacent and incompetent. The inability to contain the spread forced the country into a rigid lockdown, with rules drafted in part by Cummings himself. On Saturday the Guardian revealed that at the end of March Cummings and his wife, Mary Wakefield – who is a commissioning editor for Spectator magazine – both suffering symptoms of Covid-19, drove 400km north to his parents’ farm because he feared he couldn’t look after his young son. It then emerged he had driven to a north-east beauty spot with Wakefield and their and child during the lockdown. This flouting of the social distancing rules have brought a hail of criticism on his head, with a telling charge that there was one rule for the elite and one rule for the rest of the country. Appearing before the media on Monday, the usually unaccountable, silent figure explained in his mild northern accent why it was perfectly reasonable to make the journey and then have another spin in his Range Rover to test his eyesight. Most of the public had probably never even heard him speak before, an odd feature for a moment that stopped the nation. What happens next? Cummings’s defiant performance in front of the media brought another statement of support from Boris Johnson, who claims that his most valued adviser had acted reasonably. But the deciding factor in determining Cummings’s future in No 10 will be reaction of voters who have been locked up in strict isolation for weeks. A growing number of Tory MPs are calling for Cummings to be sacked as their inboxes fill with irate emails from their fed up constituents. One Tory MP speaking off the record summed up the gathering national mood: “He claims to be part of a government of the people against ‘the elite’, but really he has shown contempt for the people I represent.”"
2020-05-26T19:57:48Z,politics,Politics,David Evans appointed Labour's new general secretary after winning vote,"Labour’s ruling body has appointed David Evans as its new general secretary, a move welcomed by the party’s leader, Keir Starmer, who said it would “restore trust and build a team that can win the next election”. Evans, elected by the national executive committee on Tuesday, described his appointment as “an honour and a privilege”. He replaces Jennie Formby, a Corbyn supporter, who announced she was standing down shortly after Starmer was elected leader. The vote was allegedly a close run between Evans, assistant general secretary in the early 2000s, and a trade unionist candidate, Byron Taylor, favoured by those on the left of the party. Evans was Starmer’s preferred choice, and the appointment strengthens his leadership over the party. “It is an honour and a privilege to be appointed general secretary of the Labour party,” Evans said. “We face a defining period in the history of our great party, with a global pandemic, an imminent recession and a mountain to climb to win the next election. Through the strength of our movement, I know we can rise to this challenge. “I look forward to working with our party, trade unions and members to build a team that can win us the next general election and give us the opportunity to once again serve the British people in government.” The other candidates on the shortlist were Karin Christiansen, former general secretary of the Co-operative Party between 2012 and 2015 and the managing director of data polling and campaigns firm Datapraxis; Andrew Fisher, former Labour executive director of policy and research under Jeremy Corbyn; Neena Gil, a former West Midlands MEP; and Amanda Martin, president of the National Education Union. Starmer said: “I want to congratulate David on his appointment as general secretary. He brings a wealth of experience to this crucial role and a clear understanding of the scale of the task ahead of us. I look forward to working with David to build a team that can help us restore trust with the British people and build a team that can win the next election.” Evans was also welcomed by the deputy leader, Angela Rayner. The new general secretary worked for Labour between between 1995 and 2001 and went on to set up the political research organisation The Campaign Company, of which he was director. He was a councillor in Croydon from 1986 to 1990. The website Labour List reported that there have been concerns about Evans within some ranks of the party after he wrote a report in 1999 that described local parties as “dysfunctional” and compared them to Del Boy’s “Trotters Independent Traders”. Trade unions on the left have said the report recommended a “radical overhaul” of the party that could “empower modernising forces within the party and marginalise old Labour”. Evans also co-authored a report into Labour’s 2015 general election loss which called for the party to be more fiscally prudent and “small-c conservative” on family, work and the country. A former Corbyn staffer described this as principles not characteristic of the views of the membership in 2020. The Jewish Labour Movement, a Labour affiliate, tweeted: “We look forward to working with him to ensure Labour deals with its flawed disciplinary processes and the toxic culture in local parties, including acting on the 19 steps we set out for his predecessor.”"
2020-05-26T19:06:01Z,politics,Politics,Needy Matt becomes Door Matt in defending Dom’s Durham flit | John Crace,"Cometh the hour, cometh the man. There was a brief moment after Matt Hancock recovered from coronavirus when he appeared to be a man of principle. That proved to be nothing more than a chimera. Now he has revealed himself to be the most abject of career politicians, who will literally do and say anything to save his job. So there was no one Boris Johnson could have trusted more than Matt to have taken the Downing Street press conference on the day after Dominic Cummings had been granted the freedom of the No 10 rose garden – there’s a code for special advisers specifically saying they should not make public statements – to annihilate what was left of his credibility. Needy Matt is the health secretary with the perfect grasp of the public good. When it came to a straight choice between sticking to government health guidelines or protecting the career of Boris’s boss, it was a no-brainer. Who cared if thousands more might die because they couldn’t see the point of sticking to the rules if Dom didn’t, providing Downing Street’s very own Prince Andrew was still in post? Long live the People’s Government! Oddly, we haven’t heard that slogan much lately. Can’t think why. How did Matt let it come to this? What makes the tragedy so riddled with pathos is that Hancock deep down knows he is so busted. That he has traded what passed for his self-respect for loyalty to two men who think morality is for suckers. You can see it in the terror in his eyes and the increasing shirtiness in his responses. He is now so brittle, he could shatter into a thousand tiny fragments at any moment. I give it five days at most. Because not only has his track-and-trace app proved to be totally useless, but he’s also only got five days to meet the arbitrary target of 200,000 tests a day that Boris set when under pressure from Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions. So far, we’re on under 110,000. It’s just not going to happen, Matt. And the public won’t get fooled twice with fake testing targets. As it is, Laughing Boy Dom has already as good as turned the country feral. Having basically admitted he had nothing to say about anything, Needy Matt first took a question from a vicar in Brighton. That won’t be allowed to happen again, because Martin asked if everyone who had been done for travelling with children could have their fixed penalty notices rescinded. Matt’s eyes widened and darted about in panic. “Er…” he said. Perhaps that might not be such a bad idea. He’d have a word with the chancellor. It was now clear that there was no law Classic Dom might have broken over the past 20 years that the government wouldn’t be willing to review, just to keep the de facto prime minister in his job. That dope Dom might have smoked at university? Maybe it was time to have drugs legalised after all. That time Dom had driven at 35mph in a 30mph zone? Maybe it was time to up the speed limit so that kids could learn to keep their wits about them in urban areas. That blogpost on pandemics Dom had said he wrote a year ago which it has now emerged had been updated a few weeks back? Actually, scrub that: duplicity has already become an accepted practice in the current administration. Having rewritten half the penal code, Matt got down to the real business of defending Dom’s moonlight flit to Durham. Classic Dom had absolutely followed the guidelines to the letter. The instructions couldn’t have been more clear. In the event of your partner getting coronavirus and you finding yourself in exceptional danger of having to be responsible for childcare on your own – just imagine! – you were expected to go into work the next day to pass on the infection before driving 260 miles north to your father’s estate. It had been so sad Dom had only been able to stay in a concrete outhouse – so that you could overload the NHS services somewhere else when your son got ill. It would also be now mandatory for everyone to drive to Barnard Castle as part of the DVLA eyesight test for a nice family day out by the river. And there was no question of his wife being allowed to drive the car at any point even though she had frequently written about having done so. The Cummingses’ car was a manual. Which meant it had to be driven by a man. There was also no need for Dom to have at any time told anyone where he was, because he was the nation’s leader and he could do what he liked. Needy Matt was adamant, however, that the little people should continue to obey the government’s instructions on self-isolation and freedom of movement because they were both too stupid and not important enough to be allowed to use their own judgment. “People must keep their resolve,” he pleaded tetchily. All other questions were basically dismissed. Robert Peston was sawn off at the knees before he had even completed his question and other journalists were given brief non-answers and no follow-ups. The 71% of the country – including the ever-so-brave Jeremy Hunt, who had written to constituents explaining that though Classic Dom had broken the guidelines on three occasions he was basically too timid to raise it with the prime minister – who thought Cummings was an establishment elite chancer were basically just wrong. And that was an end to the matter. The important thing was that he and Dom should remain in their jobs. It was just that Matt’s job description had changed over the course of the brief 30-minute presser. Needy Matt had become Door Matt. A useful idiot to be walked all over, because there’s no way the Dom story is going away. There is no happy ending. The government is hopelessly compromised. As is Matt. The hollowed-out health secretary without qualities. No integrity. No competence. No anything. Sans eyes, sans teeth, sans everything."

Anger over Cummings’ actions and the prime minister’s defence of them had led some to reject the official guidance on containing the virus, amid perceptions that those in power are failing to make the same sacrifices as the public, the adviser said. “We know that there is understandable public anger over the Dominic Cummings incident and Boris Johnson’s defence of it, and that this anger is the basis of some people now rejecting the guidance on staying at home,” said Prof John Drury, a social psychologist at the University of Sussex.
Speaking in a personal capacity, Drury, who sits on the behavioural science subgroup of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said: “The starting point for the sacrifices people made was the assumption that we all have to make the same sacrifices. So to perceive that those in power, who supposedly embody the lockdown strategy, are not doing so is toxic.”
Drury’s intervention came as the row over the prime minister’s senior aide continued to grow after he refused to apologise for breaking lockdown regulations and claimed his actions in driving across the country with his family were justified. The incident has left some scientific advisers wondering how they can undo the damage to public trust as the country moves into a critical phase of carefully easing restrictions on movement without risking a second wave of infections and further shutdowns. Many researchers see the coming weeks as the most delicate yet, as the official guidance will become more complex and will only work if the public remain onboard.
“Despite the understandable anger, I would urge people to continue to maintain physical distancing and the other regulations, for their families, their neighbours, and their community,” Drury said. “In an emergency, no matter what we think of the incumbent government politically, it’s crucially important that people listen and adhere to the guidance the authorities provide on the public health measures necessary to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. This includes the instructions to physically distance and to stay at home.” Beyond the concern that some now perceived an “us and them” situation with those in power exempt from the restrictions, Drury warned of a shift away from a sense of shared rules towards one of personal judgments taking precedence.
Another adviser on the same subgroup, Prof Stephen Reicher at the University of St Andrews, said public solidarity had been fundamental to the success of the lockdown so far and would be as crucial in the weeks and months ahead as ministers looked for the safest route to reopening the country without an upsurge in infections. Speaking in a personal capacity, Reicher said: “What is absolutely undeniable is that the unity, the sense that we were all pulling together for the common good, has been broken. They have driven a wedge between themselves and at least a proportion of the public who feel alienated and feel there’s one law for us and another for them.
“If people are acting out of individual interest, you can have huge difficulties in securing adherence to the advice, because for quite a lot of people, the risks for going out are relatively low. If you’re young, if you’re healthy, there aren’t that many risks. So you might say: well, I’m thinking about myself, I might as well go out. It’s no problem for me.” Reicher added: “The thing that really concerns me is that Cummings’ defence compounds the problem, because the problem is a lack of an understanding of the importance of thinking and acting in terms of the communal good. It shows that they don’t even understand what the problem is. “Going forward, our ability to deal with the pandemic depends upon adherence and compliance as much as ever. That needs to be understood. it’s important that people understand that we’re still in the middle of this pandemic. The situation is as dangerous as ever and if we stop being vigilant we are in danger.”"
2020-05-26T18:42:33Z,politics,Politics,Public anger swells ranks of Tory MPs turning on Dominic Cummings,"Dominic Cummings has little love for Tory MPs, having once said they “basically don’t care” about ordinary people. But a swelling band of Conservatives showed on Tuesday they were prepared to be swayed by the ordinary people who are their constituents, as at least 32 publicly called for Cummings to resign or be sacked for breaking lockdown rules. A further eight were publicly critical of the senior aide’s actions, and three Tory MPs said off the record that they thought he should be forced out. “He claims to be part of a government of the people against ‘the elite’, but really he has shown contempt for the people I represent,” said one who is urging him to go. Despite Cummings’ attempt to explain himself at a press conference in the rose garden of No 10 on Monday, a trickle of Tory MPs expressing anger turned into a deluge throughout Tuesday, as their postbags and inboxes bulged with furious complaints.
Steve Baker, the straight-speaking former Brexit minister, was the first to put his head above the parapet over the weekend, with an article entitled “Cummings must go”. Many more were given the impetus to speak out after Douglas Ross, the MP for Moray, issued a blistering statement of resignation as a Scotland Office minister shortly after 9am on Tuesday. “I have constituents who didn’t get to say goodbye to loved ones; families who could not mourn together; people who didn’t visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government,” he wrote. “I cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right.” One former cabinet minister said Tory WhatsApp groups had buzzed with praise for Ross’s resignation as it happened, which had prompted other backbenchers to feel they should go public. He denied their actions were coordinated, suggesting instead they had “all moved together, like a flock of swallows”. Others may claim they acted more like vultures, circling floundering prey.
There were former cabinet ministers – Jeremy Wright and Mark Harper, select committee chairs such as Caroline Nokes and Sir Bob Neill, and new MPs from 2019. One of the new intake, Elliot Colburn, representing a highly marginal seat in south-west London, told his constituents: “It is clear that many feel his decision is not one that they would have come to, or have open to them in similar circumstances. I myself do not believe I would have come to such a decision, although I confess that neither myself nor my husband-to-be have children yet. “What is more, I am deeply concerned about what this could do to the public’s engagement with the measures being taken to tackle this virus.” Those speaking out were from no particular tribes, ranging from hardline Brexit supporters such as Peter Bone to former second referendum supporters such as Damian Collins. “The rose garden interview just confirmed to me that he had driven up to Durham when we were in a strict lockdown. He absolutely should resign,” said Bone. “I have 400 emails from people and I’m sitting here with my colleague going through every one, and we’d rather be doing some case work but we just have so many people to reply to. “None of this is organised. This is individual MPs making up their own minds. There’s no orchestration – this is MPs looking at their constituents’ comments and deciding what to do.” However, some Tory MPs would like some collective action, such as a delegation sent to the prime minister by the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers demanding Cummings is reprimanded or sacked. Sir Roger Gale, the North Thanet MP, said: “There are people on the 1922 executive who are courageous, and that’s their job. They are elected to tell the PM what he needs to hear, not what he wants to hear.” The powerful committee, chaired by Sir Graham Brady, was silent on Tuesday and has been generally supportive of Johnson, but has been receiving representations from backbenchers. The pressure was also piled on by Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Tory leader, who told STV News: “Given the furore, given the distraction this is, given the distraction of the prime minister on this issue, if I were Mr Cummings I would be considering my position.” No 10 was still hoping to ride out the storm on Tuesday night, with supporters of the government pointing out that the publicly critical MPs amounted to about one in nine of the parliamentary party. While some of their colleagues called for Cummings to go, dozens of Tories were also busily copying and pasting supportive messages and the adviser’s full statement to their websites and Facebook pages in an attempt to bolster the government’s position. However, even many of those who issued statements to defend Cummings have done so through gritted teeth and with deep frustration that the government’s coronavirus response has been so thoroughly derailed. When asked how Cummings could manage to cause so much damage with a cavalier approach to the lockdown rules, one leave-supporting Tory backbencher who knows Cummings well said the adviser was a master of the resonant three-word phrase – take back control, or get Brexit done – but in this instance a four-word phrase had been more applicable: “Don’t give a fuck.”"
2020-05-26T17:00:51Z,politics,Politics,Inconsistencies between Cummings’ lockdown story and his wife’s,"On Monday, Dominic Cummings finally gave an account of his trip to Durham during lockdown – more than a month after his wife, Mary Wakefield, wrote about their experiences of lockdown for the Spectator magazine. The two versions are not entirely consistent. An analysis of their stories, together with eyewitness accounts, throws up questions and peculiarities that are yet to be resolved. Friday 27 March By Cummings’ account, his wife fell ill during the day, prompting him to rush home from No 10 to take care of her. He then returned to the office, despite having spent time with someone he strongly suspected to have coronavirus. They drove to Durham that evening, and he developed symptoms himself overnight. But in Wakefield’s article, she wrote: “That evening as I lay on the sofa, a happy thought occurred to me: if this was the virus, then my husband, who works 16-hour days as a rule, would have to come home.” By her husband’s recollection, he had already been home. And why did Cummings return to the office after spending time with his symptomatic wife? 2/3 April Wakefield wrote that “day six is a turning point”, when her husband was having such difficulty breathing that she feared he should be in hospital. Day six of her account would appear to be Thursday 2 April. Yet according to Cummings, the following day he was well enough to drive to hospital to pick up their son, who had been taken ill the night before. Sunday 12 April In Wakefield’s account of the family’s time in quarantine, she described a range of unusual and varying symptoms that people with coronavirus may experience. She referred to her own headaches, others’ “numbness in their fingertips”, and Cummings’ “spasms”. No mention, though, of problems with her husband’s eyesight. Yet this was the reason Cummings gave for taking a “test drive” to Barnard Castle, a town almost 30 miles away, before returning to London. He said he had taken his wife and son “for a short drive” on Easter Sunday – Wakefield’s birthday – “to see if I could drive safely”. Why did the couple conclude that the best way to test his eyesight was to take a trip that would have involved using a busy A-road? Cummings also said the family went to the “outskirts” of Barnard Castle. But the location where they were seen, next to the River Tees between Ullathorne Rise and Gill Lane, is on the far side of the town from the Cummings family property, and is close to a considerable number of homes. Why did they end up here on a drive designed simply to test whether it was safe for him to take the wheel?"
2020-05-26T16:20:48Z,politics,Politics,Durham police open investigation into Dominic Cummings,"Durham police have begun their investigation into Dominic Cummings’ alleged breaking of lockdown rules, the Guardian and Daily Mirror have learned. A witness has been interviewed by detectives, while the officers also have access to software to track the movement of a vehicle used by the prime minister’s top aide. The developments came after Cummings denied any wrongdoing. It also follows police being asked on Monday to establish the facts by Steve White, the acting police, crime and victims’ commissioner for Durham, who oversees the force. By Monday evening, two detectives from Durham police visited the man who blew the whistle on the trip Cummings made to Barnard Castle, 30 miles from his family’s farm near Durham, as part of a police investigation into alleged breaches of the lockdown rules.
They visited Robin Lees, a retired chemistry teacher, at 7.30pm on Monday, two hours after Cummings’ Downing Street press conference. The detectives took testimony about what Lees had seen on 12 April, when Cummings visited the County Durham beauty spot of Barnard Castle with his family on his wife’s birthday. The aide said he had driven there to test his eyesight, which he said had been affected by the coronavirus, before a planned drive back to London the following day. On Monday, Cummings admitted to reports, first made in the Guardian and Mirror, that he had driven with his family to the town. He got out of the car near the River Tees for up to 15 minutes, he told the press conference.
Lees’ 30-minute discussion with the police was conducted at a physical distance in an outside area bordering the Tees. Lees said: “They were very thorough, asking every detail of what I saw. They were not in uniform. “They asked me a lot about my background. They wanted to know exactly what time it was. They wanted to know if it was a clear day and did I know what Cummings looked like.” Officers have access to automatic number plate recognition software to check if cameras have caught a vehicle linked to Cummings during the 260-mile journey from London to Durham on 27 March.
Durham police face competing pressures. They are concerned not to be drawn into politics and also that their actions are proportionate – at worst, breaches of lockdown laws carry a small fine if paid quickly. The expectation is that the investigation will be completed quickly. Durham police said on Monday: “We can confirm that, over the last few days, Durham constabulary has received further information and complaints from members of the public and we are reviewing and examining that information.” Durham’s chief constable, Jo Farrell, received a letter from White asking her to look at all the claims about Cummings’ time in Durham. White wrote: “I have today written to the chief constable, asking her to establish the facts concerning any potential breach of the law or regulations in this matter at any juncture.” Lees also said that in his local area he could see clear signs of more people venturing out. He said he feared that Cummings’ behaviour had undermined the government’s “stay alert” message. “Interestingly, for the first time ever since lockdown, there were a number of groups not socially distanced there,” he said."
2020-05-26T16:08:04Z,politics,Politics,Opposition leaders call for Dominic Cummings to quit,"Six opposition leaders have written to Boris Johnson saying Dominic Cummings’ cross-country lockdown trip has “severely undermined” public health advice, and have demanded his dismissal. The Westminster leaders of the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, Green party, SDLP, and Alliance party of Northern Ireland, dispatched the joint letter after a meeting Tuesday morning.
They said: “This is an issue that transcends politics. It has united people of every party and political persuasion, who believe strongly that it is now your responsibility as prime minister to return clarity and trust in public health messaging. We are clear that this can now only be achieved by removing Dominic Cummings from his post without further delay.” They pointed to comments from some of the government’s scientific advisers, warning that the actions of Cummings, the prime minister’s chief aide, risked undermining compliance with the coronavirus lockdown, and to polling suggesting the public believe he breached the rules. Cummings insisted on Sunday he had acted within the government guidelines. But in a snap YouGov poll published on Tuesday, 71% of respondents said they thought he had broken the rules, and 59% thought he should resign.
Ian Blackford, of the SNP, said: “Boris Johnson must put his responsibilities to public health first and remove Dominic Cummings from post without further delay. The longer the prime minister takes to act the more damage will be done to trust in his government and the public health advice. That is not a price worth paying.” Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader said: “The prime minister’s judgment has now become the issue, as this saga is confusing the vital public health messages needed to defeat coronavirus.” Separately, Jonathan Bartley, the co-leader of the Green party, is calling for the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, to be asked to investigate whether the decision to allow Cummings to deliver his televised statement from the Downing Street rose garden breached the special advisers’ code of conduct. The code, which Cummings himself was involved in updating when Johnson became prime minister, says: “Special advisers must not take public part in political controversy, through any form of statement whether in speeches or letters to the press, or in books, social media, articles or leaflets.” The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, had also been expected to attend the meeting of opposition leaders on Tuesday but in the event did not do so. Starmer responded to Cummings’ extraordinary Downing Street press statement on Monday by saying Johnson should have ordered an inquiry into the actions of Cummings, who drove more than 250 miles across the UK at a time when the public were being urged to stay at home. Starmer said: “This was a test of the prime minister and he has failed it.”"
2020-05-26T15:22:44Z,politics,Politics,Church leaders criticise lack of apology from Dominic Cummings,"Church leaders have lamented Dominic Cummings’ lack of apology and fear that his forced public explanation over why he left London for Durham during lockdown will not be enough to restore full confidence in the government. It came as police said they were investigating hate mail, including a death threat against the bishop of Ripon. Her colleagues, the bishops of Worcester and Newcastle, said they had received similar messages. For Cummings to face the cameras and give his account was “overall a good thing,” said the Rt Rev Paul Bayes, the bishop of Liverpool. “It implies that it’s time to tell the truth, which is always good, although the questions from reporters made pretty clear he didn’t entirely convince people.” Whether Cummings was sacked or resigned was not the point. “The point is do we trust the government? In particular, if the government start to give us clear advice on lifting of lockdown, are people going to trust it, or just wait to see what Dominic Cummings does?” Bayes said. “If they had said ‘we’re so sorry, it was a mistake to have hidden the truth for so long, it was unfortunate that the guy felt the need to do this and he regrets it very much’, if we had heard stuff like that I think the credibility of the government going forward would have been greater. “Rather, what we got was ‘ I don’t regret anything. I’m clever enough to read the small print and you’re not’. That kind of message I don’t think gives us confidence going forward”, said Bayes. He added that the bishops who had been openly critical of Boris Johnson’s chief adviser were speaking as individuals, “as is our perfect right”, and that those who felt they ought not to express opinions had missed the distinction between commenting on politics and commenting on public life. Several bishops tweeted they had received hate mail, included death threats, after criticism of the government over the Cummings affair. Police are investigating an email to the bishop of Ripon, Rt Rev Helen-Ann Hartley, which read: “Stay out of politics or it will be the death of you” The bishop of Worcester, the Rt Rev John Inge, received an email that read: “Keep out of politics or we will kill you”. He said: “I see this not as a matter of politics, but of life and death,” adding if trust in government advice was not restored, a second spike in the virus could lead to thousands of people losing their lives. Christine Hardman, the bishop of Newcastle, wrote: “I too received such an email. I feel concern for the person who sent it and will hold him or her in prayer.” The previous night she had posted that she was “deeply troubled” by the prime minister’s defence of his adviser. There are concerns that Cummings’ example would lead to others breaking lockdown amid the perception “there’s one law for the government and its cronies, and another for the rest of us”, said the Rt Rev Pete Broadbent, the bishop of Willesden. “I was glad he was prepared to try to explain things. I don’t think his explanation was satisfactory,” he added. “ Their [the government’s] way of operating is never apologise, never explain, and has also become never engage. “I am more worried about the long-term effects. In the end, Cummings is a barometer for the way in which government might be going under this regime. “The bishops who made their concerns known – OK, we may all be characterised as a bunch of ‘remainers’ trying to get vengeance – but it’s nothing to do with that. “We believe there needs to be a place where there’s proper accountability, proper democracy, and the capacity for government to be held to account for the policies it has implemented.” • This article was amended on 27 May 2020 because an earlier version referred to the bishop of Ripon as “the Rev Helen-Ann Hartley”. The correct title is the Rt Rev."
2020-05-26T15:02:58Z,politics,Politics,Tory revolt grows as minister resigns over Dominic Cummings' lockdown trip,"The Conservative revolt over Dominic Cummings’ decision to drive across England during the lockdown has grown, as a government minister resigned and the leader of the Scottish Tories joined 24 Conservative MPs in calling for Boris Johnson’s chief adviser to consider his position. Douglas Ross, the MP for Moray, stepped down as a Scotland Office minister, saying he accepted Cummings felt he had acted in the best interests of his family when fearing he had coronavirus but these were “decisions others felt were not available to them”. “While the intentions may have been well meaning, the reaction to this news shows that Mr Cummings’ interpretation of the government advice was not shared by the vast majority of people who have done as the government asked,” he said on Tuesday. “I have constituents who didn’t get to say goodbye to loved ones; families who could not mourn together; people who didn’t visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government. I cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right.” In a sign of growing unrest among Tories in Scotland, Jackson Carlaw, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, told the BBC Cummings should consider his position. The developments deepened the crisis engulfing No 10, with at least 24 backbench Tory MPs calling on Cummings to resign because of his actions and the damage to the government following his attempt to explain himself on Monday.
A further seven Conservatives MPs previously suggested over the bank holiday weekend that he should resign but have not made clear whether his press conference from the Downing Street rose garden was enough to change that view. Tory MPs began to speak out as initial polling suggested public support has drained away from Johnson because of his backing for Cummings. A SavantaComRes survey showed the prime minister’s net approval rating had fallen 20 points, down from 19 to -1, over the course of four days during the Cummings crisis. Polling for YouGov found 71% of people said Cummings did break lockdown rules, slightly up from 68% when asked on Saturday. It found this was the majority view across voters from all major parties and among both leavers and remainers. Among those to break their silence on Tuesday to call for Cummings to go were Harriett Baldwin, a former Treasury minister, Mark Harper, a former chief whip, and Stephen Hammond, a former transport minister. One of the new intake of MPs, Simon Jupp, also went public on Tuesday, saying he felt “anger, disappointment and frustration” at Cummings’ actions and that the adviser should resign. The MP for East Devon, wrote on his Facebook page: “We are all making significant sacrifices and coping with situations we couldn’t imagine just a few months ago. Many of us, including myself, have lost people in our lives and haven’t been able to see family and friends. It’s been incredibly tough for everyone … “Although I believe his [Cummings’] actions were motivated by a father’s desire to do what he felt was necessary to protect his family in exceptional circumstances, if placed in the same situation I wouldn’t have made the same decisions and would have since considered my position.” And Jupp’s Tory colleague William Wragg, who chairs parliament’s public administration and constitutional affairs select committee, tweeted: “We cannot throw away valuable public and political good will any longer. It’s humiliating and degrading to their office to see ministers put out agreed lines in defence of an adviser. This is a time of national emergency and our focus must be unrelenting. We owe it to the nation.” Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, said he thought Johnson should order an independent investigation into Cummings’ conduct. The Tory backbencher Peter Bone told the Guardian he still believed Cummings should resign. “The rose garden interview just confirmed to me that he had driven up to Durham when we were in a strict lockdown. He absolutely should resign,” he said. “I have 400 emails from people and I’m sitting here with my colleague going through every one, and we’d rather be doing some case work but we just have so many people to reply to. “I think more ministers will resign. None of this is organised. This is individual MPs making up their own minds. There’s no orchestration – this is MPs looking at their constituents’ comments and deciding what to do.” Another Tory MP said they expected more junior ministers to quit over Cummings’ lockdown breaches. “I would expect it to happen because MPs are being asked to defend something they know is wrong and they still don’t know the full facts on. I fully expect more people to stand down. A lot of cabinet ministers owe their jobs to Dominic Cummings but I would expect to see people resign at the junior minister level,” they said. “The pressure from constituents is immense and Douglas Ross’s resignation is very understandable given how thin his majority is, and it’s the same in England and in the red wall in particular.” However, Johnson has rallied behind his senior aide – a key architect of Brexit and the prime minister’s election victory – and marshalled top cabinet ministers, including Rishi Sunak and Matt Hancock, to do the same. Michael Gove, a Cabinet Office minister, insisted on Tuesday that “fair-minded people” would have to make up their own minds. The longtime ally of Cummings was sent out to defend him in broadcast interviews the day after the aide gave a statement explaining why he drove 264 miles from London to Durham during the lockdown and risked spreading coronavirus.Police, medics and scientists continued to say that Cummings’ actions risked undermining the lockdown and public health advice. Sir Peter Fahy, the former chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said officers were frustrated by the case, which made it difficult to see the future role of the police in controlling lockdown. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There’s a lot of confusion and it feels like there’s quite a gap between the public narrative and narrative of ministers about the lockdown and what’s happening on the street. “I think it’s quite hard to see the role the police have in the future – the rules about the reasons for travel are now very confused, when you see the crowds on Bournemouth and Southend beaches and other places yesterday, it’s hard to see what role the police have in trying to control that.”
Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS organisations, told the same programme: “Because of the way this story has unfolded there is certainly concern among our members, health leaders, that it could damage staff and public confidence in official guidance. Key contradictions about Cummings’ story remain, with Gove pressed to explain how the government can continue to claim that the adviser acted within the rules. In a round of broadcast interviews, Gove was asked: • Why Cummings went back to work in No 10 after suspecting that his wife could have contracted coronavirus, risking spreading the virus further among colleagues. Gove said she was unwell but did not have official coronavirus symptoms of a cough or fever at that time. • Why the aide decided that same night to drive 264 miles to Durham to stay on his parents’ estate because of concerns that he and his wife had coronavirus, despite government instructions to self-isolate at home. Gove said he had been acting out of concern that they would be unable to care for their child, despite neither of them having classic coronavirus symptoms at that point. • Whether it was acceptable for them to have risked spreading coronavirus from the hotspot of London to rural Durham where there were few cases, given their son later needed hospital treatment in the north-east. Gove said his actions had been appropriate. • Why people should accept his explanation that he needed to make a 60-mile round trip to a beauty spot with his family to test his eyesight before travelling back to London. Gove said it was safe for him to have driven and that Cummings had been “preparing for work”. • Why the aide needed to seek help with possible backup childcare in the north-east when long-time friends in London could have helped, including Gove himself. Gove said he would not have expected Cummings to have turned to him instead of close family.

2020-05-26T13:47:17Z,politics,Politics,"Can coronavirus affect eyesight? Evidence is lacking, say experts","Speaking to the press on Monday, Dominic Cummings said he drove, with his wife and child, on a 30-mile trip to Barnard Castle during lockdown to see if he could drive safely, concerned that his eyesight might have been affected by coronavirus. In a press conference later the same day, Boris Johnson also claimed to have experienced problems with his eyesight following Covid-19, brandishing a pair of glasses and saying: “I’m finding that I have to wear spectacles for the first time in years … I think that’s very, very plausible that eyesight can be a problem associated with coronavirus.” Eye problems are not on the UK’s list of coronavirus symptoms. At present, only a high temperature, new continuous cough, and loss of taste or smell are considered common signs of the disease. A spokesperson for Moorfields eye hospital, in London, said there was, at present, very little evidence to suggest Covid-19 could affect eyesight. “Cases where Covid-19 is recorded alongside an impact on eyesight are rare, so we cannot establish a direct causal effect,” the spokesperson said. Prof Chris Hammond, Frost chair of ophthalmology at King’s College London, who is also a consultant ophthalmologist at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS trust, said: “Eye problems with coronavirus, Covid-19, seem to be extremely uncommon and there aren’t any reports that I can find in the literature of anyone having visual loss due to the virus. “Maybe something like one in 100 people may get a bit of conjunctivitis, which can in theory blur vision. But it is pretty uncommon.” He added that such eye problems were more frequent among patients who had been ventilated. Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the thin layer of tissue that covers the eye, and typically has symptoms including pinkness of the eye, watering and a sticky discharge. Robert MacLaren, the professor of ophthalmology at the University of Oxford, said reports from Wuhan suggested a link between Covid-19 and conjunctivitis, as well as conjunctival hyperemia (red eye), chemosis (eye swelling), epiphora (watery eye) and increased secretions (sticky eye). MacLaren noted such symptoms could affect vision. A spokesperson for the Royal College of Ophthalmologists said the college was unable to report on an association of vision impairment with Covid-19 due to the lack of evidence. But, they added, the college had previous noted coronavirus might cause conjunctivitis. Hammond said it would be clear to an individual if they had conjunctivitis. “You would be aware that you had a bit of a pink eye and it was a bit watery and discharging. A bit like a windscreen wiper on a car, you have to blink to clear the muck off the tear film.” Hammond said a report from Brazil suggested that, from scans, some Covid-19 patients appeared to have some damage to the retina, but the patients did not have any symptoms of eye problems or loss of vision. Hammond added that severe Covid-19 might mean patients needed their reading glasses more. “It is true when you have been significantly unwell, that as all your muscles are a bit weaker, the muscles that control the focus of your eyes can be weaker,” he said. But the situation, he noted, applied only to far-sighted people, adding that Cummings appeared to wear glasses for short-sightedness – myopia – being unable to see well in the distance. As for getting behind the wheel of the car to test your eyesight, Hammond said the Highway Code stated that drivers needed to be able to read a vehicle number plate at a minimum distance of 20 metres. “When you have your driving test to see if you are seeing well enough to be allowed to drive, they test whether you can read the number plate before they allow you in the car,” he said."
2020-05-26T13:13:52Z,politics,Politics,First-time Conservative voters react to Cummings controversy,"Voters in the former coalfield constituency of Leigh in Greater Manchester elected a Conservative MP in December for the first time in its 134-year history. Before the coronavirus hit, the Guardian assembled a panel of local voters to talk about why the Tories won Leigh and what it would take for Labour to win it back. Here, four first-time Conservative voters react to the Dominic Cummings controversy. Keith Park, 67, recently retired NHS infectious diseases nurse What Dominic Cummings did doesn’t sit comfortably with me at all. Especially with me being a past healthcare worker. He just showed complete disregard for the rules. The most ridiculous thing that sticks in my mind is how he did a 60-mile round trip to Barnard Castle with his wife and child in the car to test his eyesight. I wonder what the DVLA will think about that? I don’t like that and I think Boris [Johnson] is a complete idiot for sticking by him. I’ve got a grandchild we’ve not seen since lockdown and he was only born on 1 January. I’d love to be there and get hold of him, but we follow the rules, we do the right thing, we stay away. They said you shouldn’t go to your second home, well me and my wife Jacqueline, a diabetes nurse, we were actually at our second home, a caravan up in Yorkshire, on the Sunday, the day before the lockdown, and they came around on the Sunday and asked people to leave. We’ve not been able to go back and check on the caravan because it wouldn’t be right to. Yet here’s a guy who works for the government who can do whatever the hell he wants. To be perfectly honest, I’ve never had much regard for him. His manner, his attitude, his dress. You wouldn’t expect somebody to turn up at No 10 in bloody tracksuit bottoms and a T-shirt. What does that portray to the rest of the world? Our next-door neighbour but one died of Covid. He was cremated last week. He was the same age as me, 67. We used to share a desk at school. We were very close and yet we couldn’t go to the crematorium – then you see someone like Dominic Cummings doing that kind of thing. I still think Boris is the right person at the moment and I don’t like people trying to make political mileage about the crisis because we should all stick together. But Cummings should have fallen on his sword. Catherine Guest, 60, retired cook I think it is very silly that Dominic Cummings put other people at risk, as well as his own family. Especially given his position in government. It’s a bit ridiculous. And yet it’s what I expect now. People aren’t sticking to the rules, are they heck. You should see what it’s like around here, people meeting in the streets, playing football. They have no idea what it’s like not being able to breathe. I do. I have emphysema and had throat cancer five or six years ago and had to have a tracheostomy so I know how scary it is, how frightening and painful to have your lungs fill up. I haven’t left the house for 10 weeks, not once, since well before Boris Johnson announced lockdown. I’ve not seen my grandchildren, nobody. I think Cummings should be made to pay. He shouldn’t be able to get away with it. Mind you, nobody should. Andrew Twentyman, 51, owns Twentymans pizzeria and bakery in Leigh I’m more annoyed with the BBC and newspaper reporters than I am with Dominic Cummings. I don’t like people in close proximity at the best of times – we have screens up at the restaurant so that people can’t get too close when they come in for takeaways. But the media have hounded him. The BBC in particular should be setting an example. I’ve had to stop watching it. I watch RT now (Russia Today), and get news from all around the world instead. He should’t have done it, should he? He’s gone to Durham and he shouldn’t have. I think his cocksure attitude and white shirt yesterday might have lost him a whole load of people. He’s not sympathetic, is he? He doesn’t do himself any favours. I do think Boris has lost some credibility. Cogs are turning in one direction and the masterplan has to continue in that direction. If Cummings is a key figure in that, then he’s got to stay, but longterm he’s got to go. You wouldn’t want to get someone off your main board because they made a mistake if they are a key decision maker. Declan Flannery, 24, works for gas company I am not really bothered about what Dominic Cummings did. Maybe I had my Tory blinkers on, but the thing that wound me up was seeing all the reporters outside his house really close together. Pot, kettle, black springs to mind. I had his press conference on but I wasn’t really listening to it because I was playing on my PlayStation, but I don’t get people who say it’s one rule for him and another for everyone else: people can go and see loved ones, they just have to stay apart. Did he come into contact with anyone when he went to Durham? I think it’s ridiculous calling for him to resign, wishing for someone to lose their job for what is basically a mistake, isn’t it?"
2020-05-26T12:44:06Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson to face minimal questions on Cummingsâ€™ conduct,"Boris Johnson is expected to face only a few minutes of questioning about the conduct of Dominic Cummings at his first appearance before the Commons liaison committee since becoming prime minister. A briefing note from the controversially appointed Conservative chair, Sir Bernard Jenkin, prepared for the senior MPs shows that at 4pm on Wednesday, 20 minutes have been allocated to discuss Cummings plus three other coronavirus topics. There is also unhappiness that there is no opportunity for questions about China or any other aspect of national security or foreign affairs – and some members have complained Jenkin is “going soft” on the prime minister. The note, sent out on Monday lunchtime as the Cummings affair was dominating the news, says the first phase of the meeting will discuss “Dominic Cummings, roles and responsibilities, Covid-19 ‘war cabinet’, coordination with Scot/Wales/NI”. It is the only immediate parliamentary opportunity to grill Johnson over Cummings as the meeting is taking place during recess. No prime minister’s questions are being held earlier in the day. Jenkin will start the questioning – he has remained silent on the Cummings affair on his Twitter feed over the weekend – followed by Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, the most senior opposition member.
The only others listed as being able to participate in this section are Stephen Crabb, the former Conservative minister who chairs the Welsh affairs committee; Pete Wishart, the SNP chair of the Scottish affairs committee; and Simon Hoare, the Conservative who chairs the Northern Ireland committee. Of the Conservatives, Crabb was also silent over the Cummings affair over the weekend, although Hoare did call for Cummings to “consider his position” because of the damage he was doing to the government’s reputation. Hoare, however, is listed for two questions only. The agenda, lasting 90 minutes as a whole, says that Johnson will then be questioned on coronavirus science, testing, tracking and testing, plans to reopen schools and restarting the economy – all substantial topics in their own right. The liaison body is the only Commons committee that has the power to question the prime minister and used to meet twice a year before Johnson became prime minister last July. Johnson had repeatedly cancelled his appearances before the liaison committee – normally made up of all the other select committee chairs – and only agreed to attend after Jenkin was appointed this month.
The pro-Brexit Conservative grandee was appointed at the behest of the government, even though he is not a chairman of any select committee. “I already feel he is going soft on the prime minister,” a Conservative member said. In his briefing note, Jenkin said he wanted to adopt “a topic-based approach” rather than allocate a specific amount of time to each questioner in each segment of the meeting, which typically last 20 minutes. “If it can be made to work, this will demonstrate that the committee is focused on the issues of most public concern,” he said. The Conservative added that he wanted “to prioritise chairs with a domestic remit”."
2020-05-26T11:08:57Z,politics,Politics,Outside socialising may be relaxed in England within weeks,"People in England could be allowed to socialise in bigger groups in gardens or parks in the coming weeks, a cabinet minister has confirmed, but visiting friends and family indoors still appears to be some way off. Pressure is mounting on the government to make clear its plans for easing restrictions on social contact, after Boris Johnson announced outdoor markets and car showrooms could open from next week and non-essential retail outlets from 15 June. Speaking to broadcast media, Michael Gove, a Cabinet Office minister, acknowledged the restrictions on seeing family and friends were “tough” and suggested rules on seeing only one person from another household outdoors could soon be relaxed.
He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “You can see members of your family or friends out of doors, and we are looking at seeing how we can make it easier to see, in particular, more family members out of doors in a safe way.” Changes to the rules about outdoor gatherings could be announced this week, it is understood, with ministers keen to assuage public concerns about being unable to see friends and family. However, Gove gave no hint when indoor visits to family and friends may be allowed again. The possibility of more outdoor meetings – discussed at cabinet – could pave the way for barbecues, garden parties and other forms of socialising, although it is likely the physical distancing rules would still apply.
The government’s plan for easing the lockdown in England, published this month, included a commitment to consider “social bubbles”, whereby households could mingle with one other household. It said: “The intention of this change would be to allow those who are isolated some more social contact, and to reduce the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions, while continuing to limit the risk of chains of transmission.” However, the prime minister gave no update about this on Sunday or Monday when he spoke at the daily press conference, while Gove talked only about bigger outdoor meetings being allowed “in the coming weeks”. One Whitehall source suggested the government’s scientific advisers were not enthusiastic about the idea of bubbles, which could be difficult to enforce. Gove also suggested it would be some time before pubs, restaurants, cafes and bars would return to normal.
“It’s going to be more difficult with pubs, restaurants and bars in full,” Gove told LBC radio. “What I hope we may be able to see is people being able to have outdoor hospitality, so that you can enjoy a drink in the garden of a pub or eat outdoors in a cafe. “I think it’s going to be very, very difficult for us to return to any of us standing at the bar or any of us mingling in a cafe indoors in a way that we have in the past.”"
2020-05-26T11:07:33Z,politics,Politics,Brexit talks 'risk stalemate' if no progress on key issues,"Brexit talks risk reaching a stalemate if there is no progress in the next round of negotiations between the European Union and the British government, EU sources have said. The two sides are due to resume talks next week, the final round scheduled before a “high-level conference” in June to assess progress before the end-of-year deadline. After the chief negotiators, Michel Barnier and David Frost, exchanged testy letters last week, a senior EU official said there was a risk of stalemate if the EU did not see progress on its vital interests, including how to ensure fair competition, or a level play field, between British and EU companies under a free-trade deal. “That is a crucial round,” the official said. “If there is no parallel progress – level playing field, protection of fundamental rights and governance – then we risk going into July with a major problem, the stalemate Barnier warned about.” Earlier this month, the EU’s chief negotiator said “parallelism is a condition for progress”, meaning that talks had to advance in all areas, including priorities for the EU, such as the level playing field and an agreement on fishing rights. Frost argues the UK has set out a “comprehensive set of proposals” to prevent unfair competitive advantages, but multiple EU sources say the British ideas are inadequate. In a setback for Frost, EU diplomats have rejected calls for the union to change its approach to the negotiations. One of several diplomats who spoke to the Guardian and were opposed to the idea of rewriting the negotiating mandate, said: “A large majority of member states, maybe all of us, think that we have to stick to the mandate at this point of time and I don’t see a lot of movement … there are not many lights in the tunnel.” In a further blow to the UK, diplomats also backed Barnier’s accusation that the British were trying to “cherrypick” benefits from the EU single market that were not available to other countries with a free-trade agreement, such as Canada and Japan. “The demands of the UK government at the moment are very unilateral,” said a second EU diplomat. “They want to keep the things that are suiting them, but give away things in our interest.” The diplomat referred to British interest in an agreement on professional services, such as law and auditing, that goes beyond what the EU has done with other trade partners. “To have British lawyers providing services around the EU, I am not sure that is of interest to our lawyers, especially when you [the UK] don’t want to be in the common ecosystem [of] common controls and rules.” EU diplomats are tired of the repeated reminders from Frost’s team about the importance of UK sovereignty, pointing out that their governments are also sovereign. “The EU accepts that the UK is sovereign, but that is not the issue,” said the EU official. “The issue is what you as a country are going to commit to to get access to our market. That is the real question.” A UK government spokesperson said it was to be “expected at this stage in a very difficult negotiation that both sides are making their case robustly and ensuring it is understood. We will continue to approach negotiations constructively, but our position hasn’t changed – we won’t agree to any EU demands for us to give up our rights as an independent state. “And we’ve never asked for anything special, bespoke or unique – we’re looking for a free-trade agreement, based on precedent and similar to those the EU has already got with other countries like Canada.” Adding to pressure on Barnier not to concede on fishing rights, on Monday night the European parliament’s fisheries committee threatened to veto any deal with the UK that did not include a “balanced” agreement on fish quotas, allowing EU fleets continue access to British waters. “No fisheries agreement means no post-Brexit agreement,” said François-Xavier Bellamy, the French centre-right MEP – and member of Barnier’s Les Républicains party – who drew up a report that was adopted with near unanimity by the committee."
2020-05-26T11:07:21Z,politics,Politics,'A political gale': world's press on Dominic Cummings' self-defence,"World media have reacted with disbelief to Dominic Cummings’ defence of his trip to Durham, saying that what the “machiavellian” adviser saw as reasonable behaviour did not appear so to many and risked damaging not just Boris Johnson’s government but democracy. “No regrets, no excuses, no resignations … Il ne regrette rien,” said Libération, telling the story of “an extraordinary press conference during which Dominic Cummings confirmed that he had rewritten for himself the rules of the lockdown laid down by the government for which he works”. Only once did the prime minister’s chief adviser appear confused, the French paper said, “almost taken aback by the question. Why no, he had not ‘offered his resignation, or even thought of offering it’, because he had absolutely no idea why he should have. Over and over again he repeated: ‘I acted reasonably’.” Of Cummings’ Easter jaunt to Barnard Castle, undertaken – by his account – to check that his eyesight was up to the journey back to London, Libération remarked: “To many, driving 30 miles with blurred vision and a four-year-old in the back might not be considered entirely reasonable. But not, apparently, to Dominic Cummings.” Le Monde was equally astonished. “Usually, special advisers remain in the shadows,” it said. “At worst, when things go wrong, they quit. They never speak in public ... But for more than an hour, Cummings delivered his version of the facts, assuring all that he had ‘acted reasonably’, without breaking the rules.” There was “no question of apologising. At most, he conceded one or two minor errors … But will the operation have been successful? It will, in any case, have shown how deeply Cummings wants to keep his job. And how deeply Boris Johnson cares about this very special special adviser.” Spain’s El País said Cummings was meant to be “the breath of fresh, irreverent air that was going to help Boris Johnson design a new country after Brexit”. But the adviser’s “refusal to express any remorse for breaking the lockdown rules has caused a political gale that may irreparably damage the prime minister’s political credibility”. Johnson’s “machiavellian henchman is asking for a display of understanding and empathy that at another time, and for another person, might have seemed humane and reasonable”, the paper said. “But Cummings has left a trail of political enemies along the way, and the patience of British public opinion is at breaking point. The adviser so famously capable of scenting the mood of the people has not grasped that sometimes a resignation is not fair or unfair, but necessary to protect a superior.” In Germany, Die Welt described a “bizarre” event at which “the second most powerful man in Westminster after Boris Johnson … refused to step down or even apologise, despite massive criticism of his trip to relatives during the coronavirus crisis. Cummings could have irreparably damaged confidence in the government.” The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said Cummings had “gone down in history as the first adviser to give a live press conference in Downing Street”. Usually, the paper said, “political advisers work for the government. In Cummings’ case, it is ministers who work for the adviser: one after another has been sent out to defend him.” Whether the adviser’s trip broke the rules “remains a matter of interpretation,” the paper said, but there was no denying the extent of “the outrage that has shaken the country in the past few days. Not just politicians and commentators, but academics and churchmen – all echoing the chorus of citizens demanding Cummings go.” In the Netherlands, NRC Handelsblad said Johnson was now stuck with “a growing problem. Firing Cummings, even temporarily, would remove his right hand – and Johnson’s most important ministers were appointed because of their views on Brexit, not their expert special knowledge or leadership experience.” But keeping him “is equally dangerous”, the paper said. “It will show the British public that they do not need to observe the lockdown rules so strictly. And in that case, the authority of the Johnson government will crumble yet further.”
Beyond Europe, Australia’s The Age said Cummings’ press conference had “compounded his difficulties in a manner reminiscent of Prince Andrew’s catastrophic BBC interview in November”. Of the trip to Barnard Castle “to test whether his eyes were working properly”, it asked: “After setting himself up as examiner and examinee, what were other drivers on the open road to do if he failed his own assessment?” In a crisis such as the coronavirus, the paper said, “those who wield power − especially when they do so largely behind the scenes − cannot be exempted from accountability for their actions. In arguing, as Cummings has, that his is an exceptional case, he has given the impression he is beyond reproach. That is not a healthy position for anyone in a democracy to occupy.”"
2020-05-26T03:07:55Z,politics,Politics,'Stay elite': what the papers say about Dominic Cummings' refusal to quit,"Any hopes in Downing Street that Dominic Cummings’ TV appearance would draw a line under his Durham trip have been dashed if today’s front pages are anything to go by. “No regrets” features prominently on several, with the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror using the same phrases, but in reverse order. “No apology, no regrets” says the Mail, about Cummings’ “rose garden roasting”, referring to his TV appearance in No 10’s garden. “Boris’s defiant svengali refuses to quit” the Mail says over his trip to Durham, and asks: “So how CAN he survive?”
“‘I don’t regret what I did’: Cummings refuses to quit,” is the Guardian’s headline, describing his TV appearance as “extraordinary”. His justification for driving to Durham to self-isolate was so complex, writes the Guardian’s political editor, Heather Stewart, “it might have helped if he had had a whiteboard to sketch it out on”.
The Mirror, whose joint investigation with the Guardian broke the story, has “No regrets, no apology” as its main headline, describing Cummings as “shameless”. The paper lists nine “killer questions” it wants him to answer after his press conference – including why he returned to No 10 when he suspected his wife had Covid-19, contrary to official advice.
The Times splashes with “Cummings: I did not break lockdown rules”, adding he believed he behaved “reasonably and legally”. The paper acknowledges Cummings’ account “raised several questions about his behaviour that he did not address”. It says Downing Street has tried to “orchestrate a show of support” for the PM’s aide, but some senior ministers are angry: “My jaw continues to drop. He’s saying he’s so much more important than us plebs,” it anonymously quotes one as saying.
The Telegraph runs a large picture of Cummings, but a very small headline: “I don’t regret what I did”. It saves its splash for “High street to reopen as UK edges back to normality”. It quotes from Cummings’ interview: “I believe I made the right judgment but I can understand that others may disagree with that,” adding that he knew British people “hate the idea of unfairness”.
The Sun also reserves its main story for “Open for business’”, and allots Cummings the top right hand corner with the headline: “Cummings out fighting: I did what was right for my family and my country”.
The Express also leads on the hope of businesses reopening (“Hurrah! Shops to open doors soon”), with a single headline for Cummings: “I’ve no regrets: Cummings faces down his critics”.
The FT carries a picture of Cummings, but its headline is about the PM: “In the open: Johnson sorry for public’s anger after Cummings defends trips”.
Metro considers the inequity of it all and riffs off Boris Johnson’s “stay alert” messaging with the headline: “Stay elite”."
2020-05-25T20:02:14Z,politics,Politics,Seated and subdued Cummings makes play for public's sympathy,"Dominic Cummings’ usual place at Downing Street press conferences is lurking at the back in a scruffy T-shirt, glaring. So seeing him – the éminence grise, the backroom guy – in clean-looking shirt sleeves in the sunny No 10 garden, addressing the cameras, with his boss the prime minister nowhere to be seen, was an extraordinary inversion of the norm. And it didn’t get any less strange. In his day job as Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, Cummings prides himself on wrong-footing opponents by never making the obvious, straightforward next move. Monday’s bank holiday press conference suggested he applies the same approach to family life. His justification for driving the 250-odd miles to self-isolate in a cottage in the grounds of his parents’ property was so complex it might have helped if he had had a whiteboard to sketch it out on. His wife was ill, and he too might well have contracted coronavirus, but at the same time he was indispensable to the fight against the virus and wanted to go back to Downing Street. He was concerned that his London home was a potential target, not that it stopped him driving the family back to it the moment he was given the green light to do so. And his 17- and 20-year-old nieces were clearly the best choice for emergency childcare, despite living halfway across the country. As for the half-hour jaunt to the local beauty spot Barnard Castle, it was merely a way to check whether he was up to the journey back to the capital. “We just thought, let’s whizz down the road and see how I feel.” The woods he was spotted strolling in on another occasion belonged to his parents.
In some aspects at least, the statement was a demonstration of Cummings’ mastery of communications. His demeanour was subdued and respectful, which must have taken a considerable effort since his contempt for “Westminster bubble” journalists, several of whom were eyeballing him, is legendary. He and his No 10 colleagues will have been hoping the public would watch him laying out the events of those undoubtedly difficult days – during which his son was hospitalised and Cummings himself suffered a severe bout of the virus – and feel sympathy and understanding for his plight. They will also have been counting on the public’s dislike and suspicion of journalists. Lobby hacks have been beamed into press conferences from their book-lined spare bedrooms since the onset of the crisis: but on Monday they were invited along to stand up as Cummings the devoted father delivered his statement not from a podium (of which No 10 has plenty), but seated at a modest folding table. The intention appeared to be to shift the power balance, making Cummings appear more humble and the journalists prurient and bossy. In order to sympathise, though, the public will have had to find Cummings’ actions in that torrid period comprehensible. That might have been made easier if he had felt able to admit that his decision to hit the motorway was, with hindsight, a bit rash. But apparently he still thinks it was perfectly reasonable, as was the quixotic test-run to Barnard Castle at a time when the public were allowing their children a quick turn round the local park at best. Perhaps it might have helped, too, if he had admitted, when asked by Jason Groves of the Daily Mail if he had driven a coach and horses through the spirit of the coronavirus regulations, that he might have stretched them a bit. Instead, he leant on the get-out clause about those caring for children, saying: “The guidance doesn’t say you’ve just got to sit there”. Many thousands of parents who came down with Covid-19 and thought “stay home” meant exactly that may feel they have been taken for mugs. It might also have been easier for viewers to walk in Cummings’ shoes had the story not been peppered with reminders of his privilege. It’s not his fault, of course, but few families will have had the option of a handy self-isolation cottage on their parents’ estate, with woods on site for pleasant walks while convalescing (and many might have thought it was wrong to hare across the country to get there, even if they did). Johnson has already shown that he is determined to stick by his right-hand man. Perhaps ironically for such an obsessive consumer of focus groups, Cummings’ fate is now likely to hang on what the public make of his performance – and whether they judge that however baroque the reasoning, his heart is in the right place."
2020-05-25T19:58:43Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings refuses to resign or apologise for lockdown breach,"The crisis that has engulfed the government over Dominic Cummings’ conduct continued to rage unabated after an unprecedented press conference in which the prime minister’s chief aide repeatedly refused to resign or apologise for breaking lockdown rules. After an outpouring of public anger rattled No 10, he attempted to explain why he drove 264 miles from London to his parents’ estate in Durham despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus. No 10 had hoped the move would draw a line under fury about Cummings’ behaviour after at least 20 Tory MPs called for him to quit and senior scientists accused him of undermining public health advice. But his appearance in the Rose Garden of No 10 raised yet more questions after Cummings admitted he had suspected both he and his wife had coronavirus when they made the decision to travel across the country with their son. During the lengthy press conference, Cummings claimed he drove to Durham because he needed possible back-up childcare from his teenage niece. He insisted he and his wife and child stayed in a separate building and communicated with his parents by shouting from a distance.
He also admitted they made a separate trip after his family’s 14-day period of isolation to Barnard Castle, a beauty spot 30 miles away from Durham, which he claimed was necessary to check his eyesight was good enough for the longer drive back to London.
He acknowledged they got out of the car and sat for 15 minutes by a river at a time when the lockdown rules banned nonessential trips, with exceptions for shopping, exercise and picking up medication. Cummings did, however, deny going back to Durham any time after his return to London on 14 April, saying witnesses who claimed they saw him in a bluebell wood on 19 April were mistaken. He said he had walked in woodland during his isolation period but only on his father’s property. Both the trip from London and to Barnard Castle would appear to be breaches of the government’s lockdown rules. Refusing to apologise and saying he had not offered to quit his post, Cummings said: “I don’t regret what I did … reasonable people might disagree.” Following the press conference, Johnson once again gave his full backing to his senior adviser, who was a key architect of Brexit and of Johnson’s election victory last year. The prime minister took a tone of contrition at some points, saying he did “of course regret the confusion the anger and the pain that people feel … as a country that has been going through tremendous difficulties and sufferings”. However, he also claimed that Cummings had fully explained himself and done nothing wrong, insisting: “I don’t think anyone in No 10 has done anything to undermine our messaging.” He insisted it was “very, very plausible” for Cummings to have gone to Barnard Castle because of problems with his eyesight.
Johnson added: “I’m finding that I have to wear spectacles for the first time in years, because, I think, of the likely effects of this thing.” Numerous Tory MPs and cabinet ministers tweeted their backing for Cummings after the appearance but others remained unhappy with the explanation and feared that their constituents’ anger would not be assuaged. In other developments: The police and crime commissioner for Durham, Steve White, formally asked the chief constable of the force he oversees to launch an investigation into Cummings. The force said it was considering complaints, and it issued a statement clarifying that it had not given Cummings’ family advice about the lockdown, but had spoken to his father about security, contradicting an earlier statement. The retired chemistry teacher who first revealed Cummings’ trip to Barnard Castle said he should resign. After hearing the prime minister’s chief adviser’s defence of the journey, Robin Lees said: “I don’t think that was in the rules.” Some scientists warned that public loss of trust in the official advice could severely damage the test-and-trace strategy that is vital to managing the coronavirus epidemic and may lead to a new spike in infections. Robert West, a professor of health psychology at University College London’s Institute of Epidemiology and Health, said: “There are so many holes in his narrative that only the most desperate people who want to believe him could do so.” Johnson held a cabinet meeting about ending the lockdown, as the government tried to get its coronavirus strategy back on track in the wake of the Cummings allegations. At the government’s daily press conference, the prime minister said open-air markets and car showrooms would be able to open from 1 June and other nonessential retail outlets would be able to restart from 15 June. The chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales warned people not to get behind the wheel if they feel unwell or their eyesight is impaired. Cummings’ movements during the end of March and early April in breach of the lockdown were first disclosed in a joint investigation by the Guardian and Mirror. In his press conference, Cummings made clear that he had “not considered” resigning but acknowledged he could have acted differently by telling the prime minister he intended to travel to Durham before doing so. Insisting he had acted within the spirit and letter of the rules, he said: “The rules make clear that when dealing with small children, that can be exceptional circumstances and I think that was exceptional circumstances.” Asked why he was not resigning, he said: “There is understandable anger but a lot of that anger is based on reports in the media that have not been true. It’s extremely regrettable that the media were told some of these things were wrong and reported them anyway.” No 10 was repeatedly asked for a response hours in advance of the Guardian and Mirror’s original stories and declined to comment. Cummings revealed that his son needed to go to hospital while they were in Durham. The child was taken to hospital by ambulance along with his wife, who stayed overnight. Cummings left isolation the next day to pick up his wife and child from the hospital. His son later tested negative for coronavirus. Cummings said he had no physical contact with his parents but they had “shouted conversations at a distance”. He said the trip to Durham was not mentioned in articles for the Spectator written by him and his wife about their lockdown experience because he was worried about his security.
In another remarkable admission, he said he had initially gone home from work fearing that his wife had contracted coronavirus, but then headed back into No 10 later that day to continue working, instead of isolating at home for 14 days. Later that evening he made the decision to travel to Durham to seek backup childcare, fearing that they would both become ill. In the end they did not have contact with other relatives, as his wife, Mary Wakefield, was well enough to care for their son. Cummings said he had not told the prime minister where he was going as Johnson had “a million things on his plate”, but he acknowledged this could have been a mistake. Earlier on Monday, more than 20 Conservative MPs called for Cummings to resign for breaking the lockdown, including the former ministers Tim Loughton and Steve Baker. But other Tory MPs appeared to be engaging in an effort by the party’s whips to dampen down public anger by issuing nearly identical cut-and-paste messages asking constituents to “rest assured” they were passing on concerns about Cummings to the “relevant colleagues”. Opposition leaders are to meet on Tuesday morning to discuss the next steps in holding Johnson and Cummings to account. Labour said the senior No 10 aide’s statement was not good enough. A party spokesman said: “The British people were looking for at least an apology from Dominic Cummings for breaking the lockdown. They got none. “The message from this government is clear: it’s one rule for Boris Johnson’s closest adviser, another for everybody else.” The Liberal Democrats and Scottish National party went further, calling for Cummings to be sacked. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said: “What should have been a resignation statement turned out to be a botched PR exercise that changes nothing. It is now beyond doubt Dominic Cummings broke multiple lockdown rules.”"
2020-05-25T19:32:20Z,politics,Politics,The lockdown breach questions Dominic Cummings has yet to clarify,"Dominic Cummings’ strident defence of his own behaviour was designed to draw a line under an affair that has rocked the government and caused fury across the UK. But his press conference left questions unanswered – and also caused a degree of bafflement. 1 Why not try other options? Dominic Cummings and his wife, Mary Wakefield, have family in London. But he said that they explored no other options before settling on their trip to Durham. Why not? 2 The Durham hospital trip Did Cummings consider whether there was any risk that his wife’s trip to hospital in Durham with the couple’s son could take Covid-19 on to the site? Did he consider whether the difficulty of getting an immediate taxi was sufficient reason for him to drive to the hospital when he could “barely stand up” the night before? 3 The eyesight problem If Cummings had concerns over whether his eyesight was good enough to drive to London, why was he confident enough to drive 30 miles to Barnard Castle, with his wife and son in the vehicle?
4 How extreme was the risk? The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said that the only reason to travel with coronavirus in search of childcare was if there was an extreme risk to life. Did the family’s situation constitute such a risk? 5 Why not talk to the media earlier? Cummings said that the media had been told things were wrong but “repeatedly reported them anyway”. How does he reconcile this account with Downing Street’s refusal to engage with attempts by the Guardian and Daily Mirror to seek comment for more than six weeks? Why did Downing Street only issue comments after the publication of key articles by the two newspapers? 6 When was the walk in Durham? Cummings said that he took a walk in the second week of his stay in Durham “after I started to recover”. That would suggest he still had some symptoms. The Public Health England guidance on outdoor exercise changed that week and by 9 April all outdoor exercise was prohibited for those with symptoms. So when exactly did the walk take place?"

On Sunday we had Boris Johnson, the understudy prime minister, try and fail to convince the country that there had been nothing untoward about Cummings’ trip to Durham. A midnight flit that had been so normal that Downing Street had spent the best part of six weeks trying to cover it up. Now we were to get the full story – or what approximated to it – from the person who is really running the country. And what we were treated to was an hour-long confused ramble that was disguised as the martyrdom of St Dom. A man who had only ever acted in the best interests of his family and the country. A man more sinned against than sinning. “Hi there,” he said, when he eventually turned up after a half-hour row with his wife over whether he really needed to change out of his hoodie and put on a shirt. “Sorry I’m late.” He wasn’t of course. Dom is never sorry about anything, but that was the closest we were going to get to any form of apology for having driven 260 miles to Durham to self-isolate on his parents’ estate, when the rest of the country were obeying the letter of the law, that he had helped write, by staying at home. Much of what Dom had to say made little sense. His wife had initially been ill, but he had broken with his own health guidelines by going into work the following day. He had then decided to exploit a loophole involving young children that had never been intended to apply to families in his position and drive to Durham. And no, he hadn’t bothered to get any medical advice or tell Boris what he was planning on doing. Because he was the Special One – the real prime minister – so there was no need. Indeed he might only have told Boris where he was a week later and by then they were both so ill that they conveniently forgot about the conversation until the Guardian and the Mirror rudely reminded them. That was just the start though. His car had had a full tank of petrol – nice touch – and his son who couldn’t last a 30-minute drive to Barnard Castle without stopping for a pee had proved iron-bladdered for the entire six-hour journey north. Once in Durham, both Dom and his wife Mary had been ill with coronavirus. They had only broken lockdown once by nipping out to the local hospital because their son was unwell, and had self-isolated for the full 14 days. Then on the 15th day, St Dom had risen again. And although, he was still feeling shit he felt ready to go back to London to start running the country again. There was just one small problem. His vision was playing up. So the obvious way to see if he was safe to drive was to pack his family into the car and take a 30-mile journey to Barnard Castle. Not sure if that’s quite in the DVLA guidelines. There they had stopped and sat by the river for a bit – their entire conversation had been focused on the state of his eyesight – before heading off back to Durham for a walk in his private bluebell wood. All this was said in a state of barely repressed anger. This statement was costing Dom dear. Classic Dom never explains and never apologises. And even though not a word of apology escaped his lips, you could sense that this whole exercise felt uncomfortably close to one. Just having to appear in front of journalists for whom he felt nothing but contempt and pretend to be Mr Polite Nice Guy was a humiliation he couldn’t bear. Once the questions started, the mask began to crack. He was just doing what anyone else would have done in the same exceptional circumstances. Except they hadn’t been doing that. People in far more testing situations without the comfort of a second home 260 miles away had obeyed the guidelines. Because they were mugs. The proles who weren’t able to think for themselves. If he had a fault, it was that he was just too loving and law-abiding a father. Regrets, he had a few. But then again, too few to mention. Time and again he was asked to apologise and every time he refused. Anything but that. Everything was totally above board, which is why he and his wife had both written stories in the Spectator that they knew to be misleading. Perhaps he and Mary had both been so delirious, it had slipped their minds to point out they hadn’t been in London. Then he went full-on Trump. Everything that had been written about him was completely Fake News. Apart from everything in the Guardian and the Mirror, which he had as good as corroborated. Had he thought of offering his resignation? A dismissive shrug. Who was he going to offer it to? Himself? There was no point in offering it to Boris because why would you ask your understudy? Just remember who worked for whom here. It ended in a standoff. If Dom had imagined this press conference would clear the air, then he had misjudged the mood of the nation just as he had by pleading for his own exceptionalism. There was also a deep irony that a man whose entire political reputation had been founded on the simplicity of his messaging was now pleading for his career on the basis that life was complicated. He even concluded by saying there was no point in answering some questions because the answers could be more confusing. So the journos could get lost. There was to be no redemption for Laughing Boy. His presser may have satisfied a few of the Boris faithful, but the majority of the country could only see a man who had chosen to break the rules and had – worse still – put the nation’s health at risk by effectively telling everyone they could interpret the rules however they wanted. Not that Dom would have cared that much. What would have hurt the most was that he had been seen for who he really was. A man who can turn any hint of regret into a giant “fuck you”. • This article was amended on 25 May 2020. An earlier version had misnamed Barnard Castle as Castle Barnard on second reference."
2020-05-25T19:14:06Z,politics,Politics,Fury and frustration among Tory MPs as Cummings fights on,"Fury among Conservative MPs about Dominic Cummings’ trip to Durham during lockdown boiled over on Monday as a growing number joined calls for him to resign and expressed their frustration at having to deal with the political fallout. Influential backbenchers and former ministers, as well as those defending marginal former “red wall seats” were among those who spoke out about the damage they felt was being done to the party and the viability of future lockdown rules. Cummings responded to growing criticism in a press conference on Monday afternoon in which he gave further details on his movements during lockdown and said he did not regret his actions. None of the Conservative MPs who have been critical of him released a message of support or retracted their remarks after the press conference. The level of outrage and openness in speaking out against the prime minister’s most senior adviser is unprecedented, given the relative unity Johnson has enjoyed among his backbenchers by the virtue of his 80-strong majority. The Conservative MP for Carlisle, John Stevenson, tweeted: “People in positions of power have added responsibility. Mr Cummings holds such a position. Therefore in my view in the interests of the country Mr Cummings should resign.” On Monday morning the Tory MP David Warburton described how his father had died alone as a result of following the rules, and said Cummings’s actions gave the impression of “double standards”. He told BBC Breakfast: “People have made sacrifices, this is a difficult time, this is a time of national crisis. In those sacrifices there really hasn’t been the choice to use instinct. Instinct hasn’t really been part of it. We’ve been tasked with following regulations laid down by the government.” Damian Collins, the former chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, who has previously clashed with Cummings over the latter being in contempt of parliament for not attending a committee hearing, tweeted: “Dominic Cummings has a track record of believing that the rules don’t apply to him and treating the scrutiny that should come to anyone in a position of authority with contempt. The government would be better without him.” He said that having watched Cummings at his press conference, his response to the incident remained unchanged. Robert Largan, who took the former Labour seat of High Peak in 2019, said that if the reports were true that Cummings broke lockdown rules, he should resign. In a message to constituents on Facebook, he wrote: “We can’t have a position where it is one rule for the public and another for politicians.” The MP for the Colne Valley, Jason McCartney, told his constituents on Facebook that the “perceived hypocrisy of the rulemakers” potentially threatened the success of measures that might need to be introduced in the event of a second wave of coronavirus infections. He said on Sunday night that he believed Cummings’ position to be untenable. One senior MP with a northern seat said: “I think [Cummings] should go. It’s cut through. Massively. He’s a liability.” They said they had received more than 100 angry emails about Cummings in the past few days. The former sports minister Tracey Crouch did not call for Cummings to resign but did say the incident had left her “peed off” as she had been left dealing with constituents’ concerns. She wrote on Facebook: “I don’t really subscribe to the lynch mob, now or at any time … I am pretty peed off though. At a time when we should be still focusing on the remaining weeks of this pandemic, spending my days replying to understandably cross and angry constituents is not what I should be doing.” Other Conservative MPs to speak out included Martin Vickers, the MP for Cleethorpes, who told Sky News that Cummings should resign for having “undermined the government’s message”, and Tim Loughton, a former minister, who told the BBC: “Has the action of Dominic Cummings threatened to undermine the message of the government and its ability to carry on its work? I’m afraid regretfully it has and that’s got to be dealt with.” Other Tory MPs appeared to be engaging in an effort by the party’s whips to dampen down public anger by issuing nearly identical cut-and-paste messages asking constituents to “rest assured” they were passing on concerns about Cummings to the “relevant colleagues”. Cummings has maintained a defiant position throughout, telling reporters outside his home over the weekend: “Who cares about good looks? It’s a question of doing the right thing.” He added: “It’s not about what you guys think.” One Tory MP who has children and has isolated from other family members said there should be an immediate investigation into Cummings. Their inbox had also been swamped with emails, many from people who had never been in contact before. They said: “If he’s found to be in the wrong and he has broken lockdown, he should resign.” However, another Tory MP in a northern seat said: “A lot of people think this is just the remainiac establishment trying to get revenge.” In terms of long-term damage at the next election, they said: “Events will overtake this and four years is a long time.” The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, tweeted in support of Cummings, saying he had given a detailed account of his actions and how he followed rules applicable to his family. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said it was time to move on from the issue and get the country back on its feet.

2020-05-25T18:55:56Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings tries to explain when and why of lockdown trip,"After more than seven weeks of refusing to give any detailed explanation about whether – and why - he had gone to Durham during lockdown, the prime minister’s special adviser Dominic Cummings took centre stage in an unprecedented press conference in the Rose Garden of No 10. Here are the key exchanges with journalists: Initial decision to travel to Durham Cummings said that on 27 March 27 his wife, Mary Wakefield, phoned him when he was at work to say she was badly ill, that she was alone in the house with their son and concerned she could not look after the child. Cummings immediately went home, famously being captured on camera running down Downing Street.
Cummings said Wakefield’s health improved, but that the couple were concerned they could soon both be incapacitated and unable to take care of their son. They therefore took an offer of help from his sister’s children, aged 17 and 20, to be available to help at Cummings parents’ farm if things got worse. The property had a number of separate buildings in which he said it was possible for the different branches of the family to isolate separately. He, Wakefield and their son travelled by car to the property late the same day, Cummings said, making no stops along the way and arriving at midnight. He got became sick the next day. In the event, no childcare was needed. Cummings acknowledged that neither he nor his wife asked anyone in London for help, arguing that the family offer more than 250 miles away presented a lesser risk and to fewer people. He did not explain why two relations of Wakefield’s who lived in the capital could not help. It was, he said, a “very complicated, very tricky situation”. Conversations with Boris Johnson Cummings said he did not consult Johnson about his decision to travel, arguing that “every day I have to make decisions about what to speak to him about” and that he did not deem his decision sufficiently important. He said he had a “million things on his plate”, but acknowledged that this could have been a mistake. He said that neither he nor Johnson had a detailed recollection of the conversation in which he told the PM that he was in Durham. Trip to hospital
Cummings revealed a previously unknown journey to hospital a few miles from his parents’ property. He said his son became ill and was taken there by ambulance, travelling along with his wife, and stayed overnight. The following day, when the boy’s condition improved, Cummings left isolation to pick both up, claiming he had no other option because there were no taxis available. He said he had stayed in the vehicle at all times. Cummings said he was feeling better by this point – although the night before he had been “barely able to stand up”. He acknowledged that the trip fell within his and Wakefield’s isolation period. Shortly after the rose Garden press conference, Prof Colin Talbot, emeritus professor at the University of Manxhester, noted: “The Cummings/Wakefield family ended up in a hospital in Durham – 260 miles from home. That is precisely the reason the lockdown told people to stay at home if they get sick. So as not to spread the virus around the country.” Walk in the woods Cummings said as he began to recover, he tried a walk in the woods owned by his father, next to the house. He said he and his family saw some people there, but had no interaction. “We had not left the property,” he added. “We were on private land.” Trip to Barnard Castle In arguably the most unusual part of his explanation, Cummings admitted for the first time that he had driven 30 mile to the town of Barnard Castle on 12 April – Wakefield’s birthday. He said this journey – with his wife and child on board – was essential as a means of testing his eyesight before embarking on the journey to London. He did not explain why such a drive would be safe if there were concerns over his ability to see, why he could not make a test journey shorter than the half hour he said it took him to get there, or why his wife and child were with him for the experiment. In Barnard Castle, he said, the family got out of the car and sat by a river for 15 minutes, where an elderly man recognised them – probably retired chemistry teacher Robin Lees, who has described seeing Cummings in the town. Wakefield wished the man a Happy Easter. But, Cummings insisted, at no point did the family break physical distancing rules. On the journey home, he stopped the car so that his son could go to the toilet at the side of the road. He said nobody was nearby at the time. On the face of it, the drive to Barnard Castle would appear to be another clear breach of the lockdown rules that were in place at the time.
Return to London and stop for petrol Cummings said that when the family left for Durham they had had a full tank of petrol, meaning there was no need to stop on the way up. He said he was “pretty sure we called in and filled up with petrol on the way back” but that he had been cleared to return to work and so was allowed to do so. But then he added that he was only “95% sure” of this account and that “it might be wrong”. Claim of additional trip Cummings firmly denied claims that he was seen in Houghall Woods – where two witnesses claim to have seen him, one saying that he remarked that the bluebells were lovely – on a subsequent occasion, after returning to London. “Photos and data on my phone prove this to be false,” he said, adding: “Local CCTV, if it exists, would also prove that I’m telling the truth that I was in London on that day. I was not in Durham.” Transparency Cummings did not apologise for any of his actions, but expressed his regret that he had not provided a fuller account of events to the public earlier, saying: “In retrospect it would have been better to set this out earlier on.” Asked why Downing Street has resisted answering media questions he claimed: “Answering a lot of these things doesn’t clear up confusion – it frequently has led to more confusion.” And he made the surprising claim that the media had been told things were wrong but “reported them anyway”. Since the Guardian first contacted Downing Street about the claims more than six weeks ago, the government has consistently refused to comment or give any background briefing. Cummings claimed articles by him and his wife in the Spectator about their experience of lockdown were justified in leaving out their location because he was concerned it would put his family in Durham at risk if they had mentioned it. He rejected the suggestion that the omission implied an understanding that it would be a controversial fact. Judgment Cummings returned to the question of his judgment repeatedly, saying: “I do not regret what I did. But he acknowledged that “reasonable people may disagree”. He suggested that while he understood public anger, such sentiments were largely the product of inaccurate press coverage. He declined to apologise, saying: “I don’t think that what I did in these 14 days was a mistake. I’ve certainly made a lot of other mistakes, I make mistakes every day.”"
2020-05-25T18:23:24Z,politics,Politics,'Beyond an insult': fury of those who stuck to lockdown rules,"As Dominic Cummings mounted a defiant last-ditch attempt to save his job, anger has continued to build among members of the public. From those mourning loved ones to parents of newborns who had found themselves unable to draw on family support, many shared stories of personal sacrifices made in order to keep within lockdown rules. All had one thing in common: intense anger at the prime minister’s chief adviser and at Boris Johnson himself. John and Fiona Hutchinson: ‘We had to stay put’ Eight weeks of being unable to see their grandchildren in Edinburgh was bad enough for John and Fiona Hutchinson, but then their son, his partner and children fell ill and they could not visit to offer care.
Thankfully, the family have since recovered. Like so many, they were not tested, but their symptoms were consistent with those of Covid-19. “We would have normally gone straight across from Glasgow to be there for them, but we had to stay put,” said John, who has asthma and had already been taking steps to protect himself because of the increased risk coronavirus poses to people with the condition. The family’s determination to abide by the lockdown rules, however, meant Fiona also did not make the trip, despite desperately wanting to help out. “We felt very, very sad but we recognised, as we thought anyone would, that it was what we had to do. Then we read about Cummings apparently disregarding the rules that were supposed to be in place for all of us,” said John. Chris Garside: ‘Beyond an insult’
His mother died of brain cancer a few weeks ago, but for Chris Garside she “was and always will be an inspiration” for the way in which she had confronted mortality with humour and “tons of love”. He recalls: “When the lockdown started we knew we would not be able to see Mum unless she was in her final hours. We knew we would lose most of those precious last days. Incredibly painful as that was my family would never put the hospice staff or patients at unnecessary risk.” Now his anger is evident as he speaks of “the drivel” which he says is coming out of Downing Street. “Our family is grieving after having to say goodbye in the most unsatisfactory of circumstances. It is beyond an insult to families like mine that supposedly serious politicians should seek to justify this for even a second. It is incredibly obvious what Cummings should be doing if he has an ounce of decency.” Ben Davies: ‘We are bringing up our baby without family support’
Ben Davies’s partner gave birth to a healthy baby daughter on 29 March, but physical distancing has meant relatives, including grandparents, have been unable to visit and meet her. On top of that came the stresses and strains of parenting a newborn without family and friends being able to help in person. He said it felt akin to being robbed of the experience they had hoped for, but they completely understood the rules and the gravity of the mounting public health crisis. “We are bringing up our baby without the support family would usually provide and it’s at a time when health services have been curtailed so, for example, support and reassurance for new families is not what it would have been as clinics are not physically open,” he said. “I am also a key worker and have to leave my partner on her own most days unable to have visitors. However hard midwives try to help remotely, the current situation has added to the anxiety we have experienced and the situation has impacted this special time.” He is infuriated by the revelations about Cummings, and asks: “How can a prime minister give a briefing where he so blatantly lies, avoids questions and blusters to protect his adviser?” Jenny McCloskey: ‘Only four people went to the funeral’
Although her mother was 95, Jenny McCloskey had not been expecting to have to say goodbye when she went into hospital on 3 March, two days before her death. McCloskey travelled from her home in Norwich to Yorkshire to organise the funeral, which many were going to attend, then returned to Norwich expecting to travel back for the ceremony on 25 March. Then lockdown began on 23 March, meaning she was unable to go. “Only four people went to the funeral, just the people who lived in my sister’s house,” she said. “No funeral tea was held, instead my sister and her daughter had sandwiches in their house. Nothing can ever compensate me for not being at my mother’s funeral and that it had to be such a miserly affair compared to the celebration which we had planned.”
The sacrifices did not end there. “We have a new grandson, our first, born on 20 May 2020, we have only seen photographs, we cannot cuddle him, we cannot go round to my son’s house and help, we can only sit here and wonder when it will be safe for us to go.” Debbie Golanzi: ‘My brother felt so desperate’ Starting a new job in the week before lockdown after struggling to find work after his graduation from university, Debbie Golanzi’s brother had been full of hope for the future. He was let go on 24 March, however, and was not able to access the government’s furlough scheme. At the end of the month, he took his own life. “We had stayed in touch daily and he had been asking us to come and visit but we knew we couldn’t under the government guidance,” Golanzi said. “None of us realised how difficult he was finding isolation in a new place with no work, no friends and higher rents that he had no way to pay.” Regulations also meant she was unable to attend her brother’s funeral, watching it instead on a remote link. “It was eight or 10 minutes long but it almost felt like we were watching something on CCTV. It even cut off before the last song was finished because they had to move on to another. “I’m so angry that people like my brother felt so desperate that they ended their lives, when according to Boris Johnson’s speech they could have broken lockdown rules by following their instincts. “How many good people have lost their lives by following the rules, and how many more will die as a result of Dominic Cummings effectively ending the lockdown with his behaviour? It feels as if our sacrifice was for nothing and it has made the grieving process even harder.” • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

2020-05-25T18:18:18Z,politics,Politics,Barnard Castle witness calls for Cummings to quit after hearing defence,"The retired chemistry teacher who first revealed that Dominic Cummings drove to Barnard Castle during lockdown has said Cummings should resign, after hearing the prime minister’s chief adviser’s defence of the journey. Robin Lees said he felt vindicated in giving an account to the Guardian and the Mirror about seeing Cummings and recording his number plate at the river Tees beauty spot. On Monday Cummings admitted he had been to Barnard Castle that day, saying he stayed only a short while. He said he was on a test drive to see if his eyesight was robust enough to make the longer journey back to London. But Lees said: “I don’t think that was in the rules.” Asked if he thought Cummings should remain in post, he said: “Personally, no.” But he added: “I don’t think my opinion matters, that’s up to him. A number of Tory MPs say he should.” Asked if he thought Cummings could have endangered lives by driving with potentially defective vision, Lees said: “I would imagine so.” Lees spoke after a second witness revealed she had called for the police to investigate Cummings over claims he had breached self-isolation rules by driving from Durham to Barnard Castle. Rosalind Evans, a retired council worker, has complained to Durham police after reporting that she saw Cummings on 12 April with a group of people walking in the town of Barnard Castle, allegedly breaking lockdown rules. Evans is the second person to come forward to say they saw Cummings in the town, which is 30 miles from Durham, where Cummings has claimed he was self-isolating after developing coronavirus symptoms. On Sunday Lees made a similar complaint to the police after saying he saw Cummings and his family on the same day walking in Barnard Castle and getting into a car. The revelations came as part of a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Mirror.
Evans called for an investigation in an email sent to Durham police on Monday. She reported the sighting and asked detectives to look into whether Cummings had breached health protection regulations. “Me and my partner Pete were out for our daily exercise and we were walking up from the river back towards our house through the marketplace when I saw a figure on the opposite side of the road with a group of people. I immediately said it was Dominic Cummings,” said Evans, 60. She added: “But at the time we doubted ourselves and couldn’t get a closer look because we were programmed not to go near anyone else, to be protective, and maintain our distance. So I put it out of my mind because there were other more important things going on.” However, since then Evans said she had been unable to shake a “nagging” feeling about the lunchtime sighting.
“When I saw the papers at the weekend I knew then it must have been him. It couldn’t have been anyone else. So this morning I felt it was the right thing to do to report it to the police. I am outraged and devastated at the same time. People have the right to know the truth,” she said. As well as the two complaints, a local councillor, Amanda Hopgood, has written to the Durham chief constable, Jo Farrell, asking for an independent inquiry into whether lockdown regulations were breached, possibly on multiple occasions. “I don’t want this to be politicised. My concern is for the health and wellbeing of those who live in Barnard Castle. Everybody has sacrificed so much during this pandemic and it is only right that we know the truth,” she said.
On bank holiday Monday, many in Barnard Castle described Cummings’s actions as making a mockery of the pandemic and the sacrifices they had had to make during the lockdown. Klara Halpin, 29, said locals had been “outraged and disappointed” by Cummings’s actions. The community support worker said her family were not able to attend her grandfather’s funeral when he died during the crisis. She said: “I have not even been able to comfort my mother through the death of her father as we live in different households. How is Cummings therefore allowed to travel 250 miles with symptoms to Durham. Then a further 30 miles to Barnard Castle … just for a stroll, against guidance. “The town has such a community spirit and the people have gone above and beyond to follow guidance and support one another. Yet we get tarnished by Cummings who risked spreading the virus through our town, which has a lot of vulnerable residents. This town deserves so much better.”"
2020-05-25T17:09:18Z,politics,Politics,"Cummings' trip could harm test-and-trace strategy, experts say","Public loss of trust in government advice after Dominic Cummings’s decision to travel to Durham during the lockdown could severely damage the test-and-trace strategy that is vital to managing the coronavirus epidemic and may lead to a new spike in infections, say experts. Scientists say people told to self-isolate for 14 days because they have been in contact with somebody with symptoms may be less willing to comply. The former chief scientific adviser Sir David King, who formed the independent Sage group of scientists, said there was now “a crisis of confidence”, which would affect compliance with policies to keep infections down.
King said: “Any opening up from lockdown requires having the test, trace and isolate policy fully in place. Anyone who is showing symptoms should be tested and if they test positive for the virus they are put immediately into isolation. Then they [contact tracers] trace all of the contacts that person has made over the previous 14 days and all of those contacts too are placed into isolation.” But Cummings’s decision to travel to Durham when his wife had symptoms, and the prime minister’s endorsement of that, would lead people to think they can decide for themselves where to spend the next fortnight, he said. “How do you maintain a policy if it is simply up to the individual? Because if people who have the virus are able to be taken by car anywhere other than their place of abode at the time that they have the virus, in isolation, that means there is a possibility of the virus spreading to other people,” he said. Robert West, a professor of behavioural psychology at University College London and a member of the government’s behavioural scientists advisory body Spi-B, said some of those who had been in contact with someone who had the virus but did not themselves have symptoms would decide not to self-isolate for 14 days. “It is not a question of whether, but of how many,” he said. “Our job now – or the job of anyone who has responsibility for this – is to minimise that and do the very best we can to restore confidence.” He said a lot of people thought contact tracing ought to be run locally, by people who knew and understood their communities and would have more chance of convincing people to self-isolate in situations where they might lose money by not being able to work, for instance. West said the government app to warn people that they have been near someone with Covid-19 was unlikely to succeed now. It is also distrusted by many over privacy issues."
2020-05-25T16:35:23Z,politics,Politics,Unions and business support Sunak's 'last resort' bail out plans,"Unions and business groups have backed the government’s plan to bail out strategically important companies whose failure would “disproportionately harm the economy”. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is exploring plans for the taxpayer to step in and rescue struggling companies to prevent a wave of job losses in sectors that have been hardest hit during the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown. Under the plan named Project Birch, the government would support companies as a last resort. Unite, the UK’s largest union, said it was welcome news that a rescue plan was “finally taking shape”, adding: “There is no more time to lose if we are to prevent a tsunami of job losses from sweeping through communities this summer.”
The government is in talks with multiple companies over possible state aid, with airlines and their aerospace suppliers saying they are under particular pressure after lockdown effectively closed the skies. Virgin Atlantic, the airline controlled by Sir Richard Branson, and Loganair, a regional carrier, have both said they are looking for government help. Virgin Atlantic plans to cut 3,000 jobs, and has asked the government for a £500m emergency loan. The Jet engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce is discussing extra government support through existing research funding programmes. The German airline Lufthansa on Monday said it would receive a €9bn (£8.1bn) bailout from its government, while Air France-KLM has received €7bn in loans and loan guarantees from the French state. Britain’s carmakers, who employ thousands of workers, are also struggling as factories reopen at slower rates. Jaguar Land Rover is in talks with the government over potential state aid of as much as £1bn, while Aston Martin has said that it is looking at options for further government funding. Tata Steel, Britain’s biggest steel producer, has reportedly asked both the Welsh and UK governments for financial aid that could run into hundreds of millions. The UK government has refused to comment on whether it would partly renationalise the companies it bailouts by demanding equity stakes in return for support. If the government did take equity, those stakes could then be sold if the businesses recover. A source with knowledge of discussions with government said business leaders had signalled that equity stakes would be acceptable if they were confined to being a “last resort” for companies for whom borrowing more was not an option. The government took equity stakes in some banks during the 2008-09 financial crisis. A Treasury spokeswoman said: “In exceptional circumstances, where a viable company has exhausted all options and its failure would disproportionately harm the economy, we may consider support on a ‘last resort’ basis. As the British public would expect, we are putting in place sensible contingency planning and any such support would be on terms that protect the taxpayer.” The government has already put in place support measures including the coronavirus job retention scheme, under which it pays 80% of furloughed workers’ wages, and the Covid corporate finance facility, which offers cheap loans to investment-grade companies. However, there have been concerns that some large employers with viable business models before the crisis have fallen through the gaps of existing government support. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said support “must be focused on retaining and increasing employment. It must also build value for our country – with companies receiving support prevented from engaging in share buybacks and dividend payments. “And it must be in line with our commitments on climate and the natural environment.” Steve Turner, assistant general secretary for manufacturing at Unite, said: “It’s very welcome news that a rescue plan for UK plc is finally taking shape. There is no more time to lose if we are to prevent a tsunami of job losses from sweeping through communities this summer.” Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, which represents company bosses, said: “If key firms do fail it could have a knock-on impact on businesses throughout the supply chain, so its important for the government to consider plans to support them, based on economic impact.” Government-funded equity could be one tool to deal with debt piled up during the crisis from both private lenders and government support schemes, he said. However, he cautioned that the government taking a stake in companies raised “its own questions”. “Deciding who receives investment won’t be straightforward, while many firms will be less than keen to cede decision-making to a state body,” Parikh said.
Economists have expressed concerns that job losses could rise significantly in the UK as the government prepares to wind down its furlough scheme, which has supported 7.5 million workers. The government is considering plans to make businesses pay for between a fifth and a third of furloughed workers’ salaries. The unprecedented support for UK companies is expected to remain in place until September. Rough estimates by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s spending watchdog, suggest the overall cost could top £84bn."
2020-05-25T16:30:10Z,politics,Politics,‘I think I behaved reasonably’: Dominic Cummings defends actions in lockdown row,"Dominic Cummings has refused to resign or apologise for driving 264 miles to Durham to isolate on his parents’ property while his wife was sick with suspected coronavirus. In an unprecedented move for a senior political adviser, Cummings addressed criticism of his actions from the rose garden of No 10 Downing Street on Monday afternoon, following an outpouring of anger among the public, MPs, bishops, police, scientists and medics. In a lengthy statement, Boris Johnson’s chief aide confirmed he had driven to Durham while his wife was unwell and that he had also taken a trip 30 miles away from his parents’ house to Barnard Castle while non-essential travel was banned. His movements during the end of March and early April were first disclosed in a joint investigation by the Guardian and Mirror.
“The rules make clear that when dealing with small children that can be exceptional circumstances and I think that was exceptional circumstances,” Cummings said. Asked why he was not resigning, he said: “There is understandable anger but a lot of that anger is based on reports in the media that have not been true. It’s extremely regrettable that the media were told some of these things were wrong and reported them anyway.” He later added: “I have not offered to resign … I have not considered it.”
The senior adviser also revealed that his son had needed to go to hospital in Durham while they were staying at a separate property on his parents’ farm. The child was taken to hospital by ambulance, along with his wife, and stayed overnight, before Cummings left isolation the next day to pick up his wife and child from the hospital. His son later tested negative for coronavirus. Cummings said he had no physical contact with his parents but they had “shouted conversations at a distance” and that he made the trip to Barnard Castle because he was trying to work out if he was fit enough and his eyesight was good enough to drive back to London that week.
But he admitted getting out of the car in Barnard Castle and sitting by a river for 15 minutes at a time when the guidelines said non-essential travel was banned and people should only be leaving the house for exercise, essential shopping and picking up medication. He said the trip to Durham was not mentioned in articles for the Spectator written by him and his wife about their lockdown experience because he was worried about his security. Cummings also said he had not told the prime minister where he was going as Johnson had “a million things on his plate” and acknowledged this could have been a mistake.
The prime minister has stood by his senior aide, giving a defiant press conference on Sunday. Johnson claimed his adviser had acted “responsibly, legally, and with integrity” and had followed his instincts as a father by travelling to seek possible backup childcare for his four-year-old son. However, more than 20 Conservative MPs have called for him to resign for breaking the lockdown, including the former ministers Tim Loughton and Steve Baker. Other Tory MPs appeared to be engaging in an effort by the party’s whips to dampen down public anger by issuing nearly identical cut-and-paste messages asking constituents to “rest assured” they are passing on concerns about Cummings to the “relevant colleagues”."
2020-05-25T15:29:54Z,politics,Politics,"Cummings' actions show government cannot be trusted, says adviser","A leading scientist from the government’s official advisory body has said there is a “vacuum in the heart of government” following Dominic Cummings’ press conference on breaking lockdown, and that “we now have to recognise that central government probably cannot be trusted to provide leadership.” Robert West, a professor of health psychology at University College London’s Institute of Epidemiology and Health, who sits on the advisory group on behavioural science for Sage told the Guardian: “From a public health perspective what we now have to recognise is that central government probably cannot be trusted to provide leadership, and other agencies, including local and regional government, are going to have to work together to make up for this. It will be difficult and maybe things will change but as things stand there is a leadership vacuum in the heart of government.” In reference to Cummings’ account of why he drove hundreds of miles to Durham during lockdown, West said: “There are so many holes in his narrative that only the most desperate people who want to believe him could do so. Not least is the idea that someone who is not an idiot would drive for 30 miles (coincidentally to a tourist attraction) with his wife and child in the car to check that he was safe to drive.” “It may sound odd but I really wanted him to find a credible and honourable way out of this mess,” said West. “But the whole thing is playing out like a Greek tragedy with the protagonists trapped by their own proclivities to self-destruct - in his case by his hubris and inability to say sorry.” West also said there had been growing unease among his advisory colleagues about a divergence between the scientific advice and the government’s approach. “Those of us on Spi-B have been increasingly concerned about the extent to which the government’s approach to the behavioural sciences and the messaging, particularly, has been at 180 degrees from the kind of advice that we have been sending into the Cabinet Office,” said West. Members of Spi-B, the advisory group on behavioural science, say their recommendations to set very clear and unequivocal messages for the public to follow have frequently been ignored by politicians. They fear Cummings’ apparent disregard of the rules will be extremely damaging. He noted that ministers got a lot of flak for changing the advisory slogan from “stay at home” to “stay alert” as they began to talk of easing the lockdown. “And rightly so, because it is exactly the kind of thing that you would have hoped they would have consulted with their scientific advisers on, in order to come up with something that would be meaningful at a really important stage of the process.” West said Spi-B was never asked about the change of slogan. “The sense is that there’s another parallel group of people who are effectively calling the shots here and have their own views on how things should go, but they are not necessarily experts in communication or behavioural science or all the things they would need to be. “They are treating the whole health crisis as though it were a political crisis. If it’s a political crisis, what you do is try to manage your reputation. If it’s a health crisis you focus on saving lives, at whatever cost to your political reputation.” He said 40 people were involved in Spi-B, the Independent Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours, which feeds in to Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. “I know [concern] is widespread among the group but not everybody feels comfortable speaking out and I completely understand that. But there has been considerable and growing unease,” West said. “The worry is that the government has said from the beginning it is following the science, and that was never true.” The group did not expect to be calling the shots, he said, “but when the government forms policy or does something that goes against the advice, they need to explain why”. He said the Cabinet Office asked the committee to provide guidance and write papers to answer questions posed by the government, sometimes at two hours’ notice. The members were working extremely hard, he said. “Then it seems to go into a black hole and we see communications that are at variance [with the advice].” He expressed sympathy for Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance, the chief medical officer for England and the chief scientific officer, who he said were “potentially in such a difficult position” attempting to champion the science with the government."
2020-05-25T15:18:04Z,politics,Politics,Attorney general faces calls to resign after she defends Dominic Cummings,"The attorney general, Suella Braverman, is facing calls to resign after she joined the chorus of Downing Street loyalists defending Dominic Cummings’s trip to Durham during lockdown. Lawyers expressed astonishment that Braverman should have joined in what opponents described as an “orchestrated political” action. Her intervention, it is alleged, undermines the independence of her office as the government’s chief legal adviser and puts her in an impossible position in relation to any subsequent police inquiry. The calls follow Braverman’s tweet on Saturday in which she quoted the full text of the No 10 statement on Boris Johnson’s chief aide in which the prime minister said he had behaved “responsibly and legally”. She added:
Braverman was one of small number of senior cabinet members, all close political allies of Boris Johnson, who retweeted the statement. Philippe Sands QC, a professor of international law at University College London, said: “The absolute integrity of an attorney general is the prerequisite for a functioning democracy. When doubt is cast over the integrity of an attorney general, that person has to go. “She must have known that the possibility could not be excluded that the Durham police would have been involved. She has completely extinguished with a single tweet her integrity.” “She’s the adviser to the prime minister on matters of law and she therefore needs to be absolutely scrupulous to maintain an independent position on legal matters. “The prime minister has expressed a view on on the legality and propriety of what Cummings has done. In expressing that view, did he seek advice from the AG? “There’s a conflict between her position constitutionally providing independent advice to the prime minister and her role as an MP tweeting political support. She can do one or the other; she can’t do both.” Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, a former judge and war crimes prosecutor, said: “Any experienced courtroom lawyer knows that there are lines of inquiry and documentary records that would prove or disprove the allegations in minutes or hours. Every lawyer knows that records can prove what individuals, with interest to serve, may obscure by lies. Ms Braverman was unwise to back words over undisclosed records. “The uncertainty and anger generated will allow others, as a minimum, to be ‘generous’ with their own understanding of the rules. That may increase the spread and lead to further avoidable deaths.” The shadow attorney general, Lord Falconer QC, wrote to Braverman on Sunday accusing her of undermining the legal independence of her office and the law. In his letter, he said: “Your tweet appears to side with Mr Cummings in the dispute with the police. It implies you are not supportive of the steps they took. “Moreover, your tweet is supportive of a statement from No 10 which disputes the handling of the case by the police. The prime minister should not be lending his authority to attacks on the enforcement of the criminal law. He should certainly not be egged on in that by the attorney general. “As attorney general you have a special constitutional responsibility for the appropriate enforcement of the criminal law and are responsible for oversight of criminal prosecutions. “It is a rigid constitutional principle that the attorney general will discharge those functions free from political considerations or influence. It looks clear that your tweet was part of politically orchestrated campaign in support of Mr Cummings and you have breached that rigid principle.” The Scottish National party spokesperson in the Commons on justice, Joanna Cherry QC, also expressed her outrage, tweeting:
Braverman’s two immediate predecessors as attorney general, Geoffrey Cox QC and Dominic Grieve QC, are widely regarded to have been removed from office because they put their office’s legal independence above party politics. In a separate post, the barrister Kirsty Brimelow QC, who has highlighted legal problems with coronavirus prosecutions, argued that there were questions over whether Cummings’ behaviour had been legal. She wrote: “There are questions to be answered as to how Mr Cummings says that he acted legally. Indeed, unlike all those people who have been prosecuted to date, Mr Cummings’ household actually did have Covid-19. “As to the responsibility of his actions, it is completely clear that Mr Cummings breached government guidance which is presumed to be responsible.” The attorney general’s office declined to comment about Braverman’s tweet."
2020-05-25T14:57:14Z,politics,Politics,"Dominic Cummings: resign or be sacked, says leading doctor","Boris Johnson should sack Dominic Cummings over his 264-mile lockdown Durham trip, according to the chair of a leading doctors’ association who has highlighted that medics are outraged at the actions of the prime minister’s top aide. Dr Rinesh Parmar, the chair of the Doctors’ Association UK – a non-profit campaigning group that represents frontline NHS doctors – said either Cummings should resign or Johnson should show him the door. Parmar said Johnson’s defence of his adviser risked undermining public trust and prompting people to use it as an excuse to break the rules themselves. One NHS doctor who works in a Covid-19 ward has pledged to resign by the end of the week if Cummings does not – warning that others may follow suit.
Downing Street is coming under increasing pressure over Cummings’s behaviour, first revealed by a joint Guardian and Daily Mirror investigation, as the adviser now faces a possible police investigation. Cummings, along with his wife and four-year-old son, travelled from his London home to his parents’ farm in Durham in late March despite lockdown rules advising people to stay at their primary residence. The couple have said they feared they may be incapacitated by coronavirus and thus struggle to look after their child. During his time in Durham, when non-essential journeys were banned, Cummings was spotted at Barnard Castle, a beauty spot 30 miles from the home of his parents, according to one witness. Having already returned to London following his recovery from coronavirus, Cummings was seen again, according to a witness, going for a walk in the north-east later in April, suggesting he made a second trip. The prime minister defended his chief aide on Sunday, claiming he had acted responsibly and legally and describing some of the allegations – without specifying which – as “palpably false”. But Parmar told the Guardian: “Boris Johnson should sack Dominic Cummings. Even better would be for Dominic Cummings to have the foresight to resign himself because of the impact of his actions on the rest of the country. Our worry is that people will think that it’s safe and perfectly legitimate to start ignoring the rules and moving around the country in the same way that Dominic Cummings has. That has a severe impact on the containment of the virus. “Doctors are thankful that the public has been fantastic in listening to the rules set out by the government so far and that is what has allowed us to get control of the virus. But having one rule for Dominic Cummings and one rule for everybody else doesn’t inspire confidence amongst the public and doesn’t give them clear guidance about what they should do.” Speaking before Cummings spoke to the press, he added: “We’ve seen on the frontline the real consequences of what happens when you don’t control the virus. That’s devastating for families who are denied access to hospitals to see their loved ones at the time when they need them the most.” “The sense of feeling is really strong amongst doctors writing to us across our social media platforms. They are outraged, given what they’ve seen and had to endure over the last few months.” Meanwhile, Dr Dominic Pimenta, a cardiology registrar who works in a Covid-19 ward, has warned he will resign by the end of the week if Cummings does not. “I found it incredibly insulting to see the whole cabinet doubling down on this issue and undermining the public who are working incredibly hard to follow the guidance, it’s a betrayal,” he said. “NHS staff have bent over backwards to meet this incredible challenge, spending hundreds of extra hours in meetings and drawing up timetables to care for patients. His comments came after he tweeted a picture of himself wearing protective equipment on Sunday, writing: “This is me right now heading back into the covid ICU I’ve worked for the last two months. This stuff is hot and hard work. Haven’t seen my parents since January. Frankly, Cummings spits in the face of all our efforts, the whole #NHS. If he doesn’t resign, I will.” The Faculty of Public Health, a UK charity representing nearly 4,000 public health professionals, said it was “deeply concerned that recent actions from government appear to undermine essential public health messaging at this crucial time,” adding in a tweet: “If there is doubt regarding the actions of those involved with government, FPH supports at the very least, an inquiry into the matter.” Meanwhile, three NHS trust chiefs publicly criticised Cummings, according to the Health Service Journal."
2020-05-25T14:53:07Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings draws condemnation from across UK society,"The revelation that Dominic Cummings travelled to Durham during the lockdown has touched a nerve with millions of people who have stuck rigidly to the governments’ rules. The disclosures provoked condemnation across society, and it grew on Sunday when Boris Johnson defended Cummings without offering a detailed explanation or agreeing to an inquiry into the matter. The political class were always going to react, but it also angered senior members of the clergy, who accused him of treating people as mugs, and scientists who said he had “trashed” their advice. Police, lawyers, medics and the media have also weighed in. Scientists “On top of all the failing to get the tests in, failing to get the PPE, where thousands of lives have already been lost unnecessarily, this on top of that is the last straw for many people … This is being perceived as extremely unfair in a situation where millions of people have made huge sacrifice.” Susan Michie, a member of SPI-B, the government’s advisory group on behavioural science “Boris Johnson has trashed all the advice we have given on how to build trust and secure adherence to the measures necessary to control Covid-19.” Prof Stephen Reicher, SPI-B member “I am sorry to have to say that as another member of SPI-B I have to agree.” Robert West, SPI- B member “It is the feeling they are taking everyone for fools and that there is one rule for them and one rule for everyone else, and it will stop lockdown being effective.” Christina Pagel, professor of operational research at University College London and member of the independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage)
Clergy “The question now is: do we accept being lied to, patronised and treated by a PM as mugs?” Nick Baines, bishop of Leeds “I find myself deeply worried by the PM’s judgment call on this one. Not from a political perspective but a moral one. His response lacks both integrity and respect.” Olivia Graham, bishop of Reading “I don’t usually tweet politics, and I have carefully steered clear during the pandemic. But tonight I must say: the PM and his cabinet are undermining the trust of the electorate and risks to life are real.” Pete Wilcox, bishop of Sheffield “It’s that sense of deception there, that we are being either lied to, or at the very least things are being hidden from us that we need to know in order that we, the people of this country, can really understand that we are all in this together,” said David Walker, the bishop of Manchester. He urged Johnson’s cabinet colleagues to tell him: “Look Boris you got that wrong … everybody can forgive a sinner who’s repentant. Say you’ve got it wrong and we can move on.” “The PM tells us that Cummings ‘followed the instincts of every father’ and that he ‘does not mark him down for that’. The point is that thousands and thousands of parents, including me, have not been able to follow their instincts because they felt they had to obey the rules!” John Inge, bishop of Worcester
Police “What the prime minister did yesterday has now made it exponentially tougher for all those people on the frontline … enforcing the lockdown. We are in the middle of a national emergency and people who make the rules cannot break the rules, otherwise we are going to have chaos.” Mike Barton, former chief constable of Durham “It makes it much harder for the police going forward. This will be quoted back at them time and time again when they try to enforce the new rules. But I think more importantly it makes something of a mockery of the police action going back when the message was very, very clear: stay at home.” Martin Surl, independent police and crime commissioner for Gloucestershire Politicians “This was a test of the prime minister and he has failed it. It is an insult to the sacrifices made by the British people that Johnson has chosen to take no action against Dominic Cummings. If I were prime minister, I would have sacked Cummings.” Keir Starmer, Labour leader
“I fear, and I say this with a heavy heart, Boris Johnson is putting political interest ahead of public interest,” said Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland. She also drew comparison with the resignation of Scotland’s chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood: “ She didn’t try to save her own skin at the expense of the public health message and I think that’s what has to happen here now with the prime minister and Dominic Cummings.” “If the prime minister doesn’t sack Cummings today, his authority to lead the country in this public health crisis will be totally undermined.” Ed Davey, acting Liberal Democrat leader “Like other MPs commenting my inbox is chockablock with emails from constituents furious about Dominic Cummings and Boris Johnson’s blasé endorsement of his actions. The hypocrisy stinks and people know it.” Jonathan Ashworth, shadow health secretary Legal “The uncertainty and anger generated will allow others, as a minimum, to be ‘generous’ with their own understanding of the rules. That may increase the spread and lead to further avoidable deaths.” Geoffrey Nice QC, former judge and war crimes prosecutor “It is very clear that there is a very significant issue as to whether Dominic Cummings has committed a criminal offence under regulation 6 of the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (England) 2020 ... ‘no person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse’.” Lord Falconer, shadow attorney general “There are questions to be answered as to how Mr Cummings says that he acted legally. Indeed, unlike all those people who have been prosecuted to date, Mr Cummings’ household actually did have Covid-19.” Kirsty Brimelow QC Medics “Frankly, Cummings spits in the face of all our efforts, the whole NHS. If he doesn’t resign, I will.” Dr Dominic Pimenta, cardiology registrar on a Covid-19 ICU ward “The sense of feeling is really strong amongst doctors writing to us across our social media platforms. They are outraged given what they’ve seen and had to endure over the last few months. Everyone has pulled together to cope through really testing times in the NHS. To many, it feels like a betrayal. The rules apply to everyone, even Dominic Cummings. When it comes to social responsibility, every single one of us in this country has had to make tremendous sacrifices for our wider community. To have individuals in power who should know better, who are privy to all the information and all the scientific evidence – which we know he was when he attended Sage - to do what he did, it’s contemptuous, it really is.” Dr Rinesh Parmar, chair of the Doctors’ Association UK
Media “He has violated the spirit and letter of the lockdown and, in doing so, he has given every selfish and reckless person in this country a licence to play fast and loose with public health … He and his master will try and brazen this out. It will not work. For the good of the government, and by extension the nation, Dominic Cummings must resign now. Or the prime minister must sack him. No ifs, no buts.” Daily Mail editorial “How many people will now use their ‘instinct’ to avoid obeying the Govt’s crucial public health guidance re Covid-19? How many of those who do will get infected by the virus & then infect others? How many people will die? This is the direct consequence of what Cummings did.” Piers Morgan, broadcaster and columnist."
2020-05-25T14:10:22Z,politics,Politics,Watchdog asks Durham police to investigate Dominic Cummings,"The police and crime commissioner for Durham has formally asked the chief constable of the force he oversees to launch an investigation into Dominic Cummings. Steve White asked the force to investigate all the claims about the prime minister’s adviser’s time in the Durham area during the coronavirus lockdown and to establish the facts. Cummings, along with his wife and four-year-old son, travelled 260 miles from their London home to his parents’ farm in Durham in late March. The couple say they feared they might have been incapacitated by coronavirus and thus might have struggled to look after their child. Many view that as a breach of the lockdown rules to stay home and have called for Cummings to resign or be sacked as chief aide to Boris Johnson.
Durham police are understood to have received further information and complaints about Cummings’s time in and around Durham since the revelations in a joint investigation by the Guardian and Daily Mirror were first published on Friday. Officers are reviewing and examining that new information. A spokesman for Durham police said: “We can confirm that, over the last few days, Durham Constabulary has received further information and complaints from members of the public and we are reviewing and examining that information.” Later on Monday, the force issued a statement amending what it had previously said about its contact with the Cummings family. Durham police said on Friday that officers had explained to the family the guidelines around self-isolation and “reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel”. However, in Monday’s statement, issued moments before Cummings gave a press conference, Durham police said it had only given security advice to Cummings’ father. “Mr Cummings confirmed that his son, his son’s wife and child were present at the property. He told the officer that his son and son’s wife were displaying symptoms of coronavirus and were self-isolating in part of the property,” the statement said. “We can further confirm that our officer gave no specific advice on coronavirus to any members of the family and that Durham Constabulary deemed that no further action was required in that regard.” Durham’s chief constable, Jo Farrell, has received a letter from White asking her to look at all the claims about Cummings’s time in Durham. That includes an alleged sighting of him in Barnard Castle on 30 April, about 30 miles from his parents’ home. The letter will say an inquiry is necessary to maintain public confidence in the force. White, in a statement on Saturday, backed the force’s handling of the matter so far. Since the Guardian and Daily Mirror first reported the story, additional allegations have surfaced. Police and crime commissioners are responsible for holding the forces they oversee to account. Chief constables maintain operational independence. In a statement issued on Monday, White said the Durham force had so far handled the matter appropriately. He said: “It is clear, however, that there is a plethora of additional information circulating in the public domain which deserves appropriate examination. I have today written to the chief constable, asking her to establish the facts concerning any potential breach of the law or regulations in this matter at any juncture. “It is vital that the force can show it has the interests of the people of County Durham and Darlington at its heart, so that the model of policing by consent, independent of government but answerable to the law, is maintained. “It will be for the chief constable to determine the operational response to this request and I am confident that with the resources at its disposal, the force can show proportionality and fairness in what has become a major issue of public interest and trust.”
The sighting in Barnard Castle was witnessed by a man who made a note of a number plate. The witness, Robin Lees, a retired chemistry teacher, has made a complaint to the police. He says he saw Cummings and his family on 12 April, walking in the town before getting into a car. At a Downing Street press conference dominated by questions about Cummings’s movements during the lockdown, the prime minister did not dispute that his adviser had made a trip to the Tees Valley beauty spot.
Police were unaware that Cummings had travelled to his parents’ farm in Durham from his London home until his father informed them. Robert Cummings asked a friend to contact police because he wanted security advice after his son, suffering from Covid-19 symptoms, arrived in the north-east in late March. Months earlier he had got advice on security for his son from Durham police, but had mislaid the contact details. On 31 March, Robert Cummings contacted someone he knew had details of a senior officer in the Durham force. That senior officer arranged for special branch to contact Cummings’s father. During that call the special branch officer gave advice on security, as well as on physical distancing. In a statement issued on Saturday evening, Durham police said they became aware Cummings was in Durham on 31 March andphoned his father the following morning, who confirmed the spin doctor “had travelled with his family from London to the north-east and was self-isolating in part of the property”. Cummings’s father was spoken to again by police earlier this month after they became aware of claims on social media – which are unsubstantiated – and inquiries from a journalist about whether his son had again been seen in the Durham area. Robert Cummings denied the claim and said his son was not present at the family farm. Police accepted his word.
Durham police have issued relatively few fines for lockdown breaches, compared with other forces. If Durham police decide to investigate, they could use automatic number-plate recognition technology to search for sightings of any car associated with Cummings, which would help in establishing his movements in the Durham area, as well as securing CCTV footage."
2020-05-25T13:36:27Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson faces renewed Tory pressure to sack Dominic Cummings,"Dominic Cummings is to give a statement about accusations he broke the lockdown, as at least 20 Conservative MPs urged Boris Johnson to make him quit or apologise. In an unprecedented move for a senior political adviser, Cummings is likely to address criticism of his actions and take questions on Monday afternoon, following an outpouring of anger among the public, MPs, bishops, police, scientists and medics. The prime minister backed his senior aide at a defiant press conference on Sunday, saying it had been within the rules for Cummings to drive his family 264 miles to his parents’ estate in Durham while his wife was suffering from coronavirus symptoms. Johnson claimed his adviser had acted “responsibly, legally, and with integrity” and had followed his instincts as a father by travelling to seek possible backup childcare for his four-year-old son. Anger among Conservative MPs is boiling over, however, and members of the public have been sending furious emails pointing out the sacrifices they have made during the lockdown.
Downing Street is still to answer questions, including whether Cummings stopped at any service stations en route to Durham, potentially infecting other travellers when the whole family should have been in isolation, and whether he later made a 30-mile day trip from Durham to Barnard Castle with his family at a time when non-essential journeys were banned. No 10 confirmed that Cummings would give a statement and take questions on Monday but did not say when. The prime minister was due to hold a cabinet meeting on Monday to discuss the lifting of the lockdown but plans to ease restrictions, such as partially opening schools from 1 June, have been overshadowed by the affair. On Monday morning, one Tory MP, David Warburton, described how his father had died alone as a result of following the rules, and said Cummings’s actions gave the impression of “double standards”. He told BBC Breakfast: “People have made sacrifices, this is a difficult time, this is a time of national crisis. “In those sacrifices there really hasn’t been the choice to use instinct. Instinct hasn’t really been part of it. We’ve been tasked with following regulations laid down by the government.”
Other Conservative MPs to speak out included Martin Vickers, the MP for Cleethorpes, who told Sky News Cummings should resign for having “undermined the government’s message”, and Tim Loughton, a former minister, who told the BBC: “Has the action of Dominic Cummings threatened to undermine the message of the government and its ability to carry on its work? I’m afraid regretfully it has and that’s got to be dealt with.” Other Tory MPs appeared to be engaging in an effort by the party’s whips to dampen down public anger by issuing nearly identical cut-and-paste messages asking constituents to “rest assured” they are passing on concerns about Cummings to the “relevant colleagues”. Cummings has maintained a defiant position throughout, telling reporters outside his home over the weekend: “Who cares about good looks? It’s a question of doing the right thing.” He added: “It’s not about what you guys think.” The prime minister’s aide faces a possible police investigation under health laws over a claim that he breached self-isolation rules by allegedly visiting Barnard Castle on 12 April. Durham police have yet to respond to the complaints from the public but the Guardian understands the force is considering whether it needs to take any further action in relation to Cummings. However, Steve White, the acting police, crime and victims’ commissioner for Durham, will on Monday ask the force to investigate all the claims about the prime minister’s principal adviser’s time in the Durham area during the coronavirus lockdown and establish the facts. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, was sent out to defend the adviser in the media on Monday morning, despite admitting he had not spoken to Cummings to find out the details of the trip. He said Johnson had been “categorically assured” that Cummings and family had “followed the guidance and … the law”. “If you have been given that absolute assurance … it seems fair to support that person,” he said.
The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has said in Johnson’s position he would have sacked Cummings and has called for a Cabinet Office inquiry. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, added her voice to the criticism on Monday. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, she said: “I fear, and I say this with a heavy heart, Boris Johnson is putting his political interest ahead of the public interest. “And when trust in a public health message and public health advice is as important as it is right now the consequences of that could be serious. I hope that the prime minister will reflect further today and perhaps come to a different conclusion than the one he made yesterday.” Some scientific advisers and Church of England bishops also expressed anger at Cummings’s actions for undermining the lockdown. Three members of SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee providing advice from behavioural scientists to the government on how the public might respond to lockdown measures, reacted with disdain to Johnson’s defence of his adviser. Martin Surl, Gloucestershire’s independent police and crime commissioner, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Cummings’s actions made a “mockery” of police enforcement earlier in the lockdown. “I think it makes it much harder for the police going forward – this will be quoted back at them time and time again when they try to enforce the new rules,” he said. “But I think more importantly it makes something of a mockery of the police action going back when the message was very, very clear: stay at home. “The police had to deliver a very harsh, very difficult message and now it appears people could act differently, so I think it does undermine the policing going back and their confidence and going forward it will be more difficult but they will cope, they always do.” Tory MPs publicly criticising Dominic Cummings Steve Baker Simon Hoare Damian Collins Sir Roger Gale Peter Bone Caroline Nokes Craig Whittaker Julian Sturdy Robert Syms Paul Maynard James Gray Robert Goodwill Andrew Jones Tim Loughton David Warburton Robert Halfon Jason McCartney Martin Vickers Peter Aldous George Freeman John Stevenson"
2020-05-25T11:25:41Z,politics,Politics,'Cummings is the real boss': world's press pours scorn on Boris Johnson,"Yes, Libération declared categorically, “the answer is yes. There really is one rule for Dominic Cummings, prime minister Boris Johnson’s special adviser, and another, quite different rule for the rest of the British public.” Yes indeed, France’s left-leaning daily repeated, “Cummings may disregard, without consequence, the lockdown imposed on the rest of the country. And yes, the real boss at No 10 is this unelected adviser, and not its current tenant, Boris Johnson.” News of Cummings’ 500-mile round trip to Durham, and of Johnson’s decision to back his controversial adviser, left much of the international media doubting the prime minister’s judgment, condemning his “shameless” response – and wondering who is really in charge in Downing St. In telling the public that “the efforts and sacrifices demanded of them - staying home, not visiting even dying relatives” simply did not apply to his closest adviser, Johnson had “confirmed the exceptional influence” Cummings exerts on him, Libération said. Italy’s Corriere della Sera agreed, saying there was “one politically untouchable man in London, and it is not the prime minister”. Johnson has “enveloped himself in unsustainable contradictions just to shield his adviser”, the paper said, but “clearly he doesn’t have the power to get rid of Cummings”. The prime minister’s personal appearance at Sunday’s briefing was preceded by a face-to-face meeting at which “it is evident that Cummings must have confronted Johnson with the reality that without him, the government is going nowhere – though now, with him, everyone is at risk of crashing to the ground.” In the Netherlands, De Volkskrant recalled that Cummings was “the architect of Brexit and of Johnson’s election victory, so Johnson does not want to ditch him just like that”. But others who broke the lockdown rules were given no option but to resign, the paper pointed out. “By insisting that Cummings had behaved ‘responsibly, legally and with integrity’, the prime minister has effectively raised the question of who exactly is the boss inside No 10 Downing St: the prime minister, or his top adviser.” The Irish Times noted that Johnson “not only exonerated Cummings, but praised him … In its shamelessness, it was a return to the playbook of his early months in office, when he gloried in the disapproval of his political enemies over his prorogation of parliament and (false) claim he would not fulfil his legal obligation to seek a delay to Brexit.” In Spain, El País said the episode showed Johnson was increasingly “losing his ability to scent what the people will and won’t put up with”. Cummings, the former Brexit guru, “seems to have become the voice that whispers advice on how to act in the face of the devastating virus crisis”, the paper said. “And for the time being, at least, Johnson is not prepared to keep him two metres away - nor to maintain the safe political distance from his adviser that many of his Conservative fellow believers are now demanding.” Le Monde confirmed the prime minister’s “preferential treatment” of Cummings was “very risky: with what credibility will his government emerge from this episode as it approaching a crucial new phase of the country’s exit from lockdown?” Continuing to defend his adviser “exposes Johnson to considerable political damage”, it said. In Germany, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said whether Johnson should fire his chief advisor had “superseded over all other coronavirus questions, bringing politics back to centre stage”. Cummings is “more than a consultant”, the paper said. “He is a symbolic figure whose loss would hit the prime minister and his agenda hard.” In a dispatch published by several German papers including the Suddeutsche Zeitung, the dpa news agency said the government’s credibility “could have been seriously damaged by the generous interpretation of the lockdown rules in Cummings’ favour”.
Denmark’s Politiken said Johnson had “so far dodged all questions about specific critical issues”, such as whether Cummings had indeed visited Barnard Castle while in self-isolation in Durham. “The question remains whether special rules apply to the prime minister’s top adviser – rules that ordinary Britons cannot invoke,” it said. The New York Times said Johnson had now “latched himself” to his chief adviser, underlining “his deep reliance on Cummings, the architect of his election victory last year and the driving force behind his ambitious post-Brexit agenda. But it is unlikely to defuse the uproar over Cummings’s actions, which critics say send a signal that Britain’s leaders can ignore the rules they impose on others.”"
2020-05-25T09:39:28Z,politics,Politics,Bishops turn on Boris Johnson for defending Dominic Cummings,"Church of England bishops have fired a volley of unprecedented criticism at Boris Johnson over his defence of actions taken by his chief aide, Dominic Cummings. One suggested the church could decline to work with the government during the coronavirus crisis “unless we see clear repentance, including the sacking of Cummings”. More than a dozen bishops questioned the integrity of the prime minister following his press conference on Sunday, in which he refused to acknowledge that Cummings had breached lockdown rules when he travelled with his infected wife and their child to Durham. The bishops said Johnson’s defence was “risible”, that he had “no respect for the people”, “lacked integrity”, and risked undermining the trust of the public. Pete Broadbent, the bishop of Willesden, tweeted: “Johnson has now gone the full Trump.”
The first bishop to go public in criticising the prime minister was Nick Baines, the bishop of Leeds, who told the Observer: “People across the country have sacrificed hugely in order to obey both the spirit and word of government advice. People have missed being with family members who have died. But, now we learn that there is one rule for the people and another for No 10 and the elite.” After Johnson’s comments on Sunday, Baines tweeted: “The question now is: do we accept being lied to, patronised and treated by a PM as mugs? The moral question is not for Cummings – it is for PM and ministers/MPs who find this behaviour acceptable. What are we to teach our children? (I ask as a responsible father.)” The Church of England could decide to review its work with the government during the pandemic, said David Walker, the bishop of Manchester. “Unless very soon we see clear repentance, including the sacking of Cummings, I no longer know how we can trust what ministers say sufficiently for @churchofengland to work together with them on the pandemic.”
The bishop of Durham, Paul Butler, whose diocese covers the Cummings family farm, said: “There will be those in Durham who defend #Boris for his standing by #DominicCummngs. But most who have worked so hard to abide by the rules and guidance of the past weeks will feel hurt, angry, & let down. Trust has been broken. For the nation’s sake rebuild it quickly.” John Inge, the bishop of Worcester, said: “The PM’s risible defence of Cummings is an insult to all those who have made such sacrifices to ensure the safety of others.” Vivienne Faull, the bishop of Bristol, tweeted: “Day 61 #livingdifferently in a nation where the PM has no respect for the people. The bonds of peace and our common life (which had been wonderfully strengthened during the testing by CV-19) have been dangerously undermined this evening.” The bishop of Ripon, Helen-Ann Hartley, said: “Integrity, trust and leadership were never there; just a driven misguided ideology of power that has total disregard for the most weak and vulnerable, and those who work to protect and care for us with relatively low pay. “My parents live in Durham, an hour away from where we live. My father finished radiotherapy treatment just before lockdown. I’ve missed his birthday, Mothering Sunday and countless other catch-ups that would have happened. And that’s a fraction of a story compared with others.”
Paul Bayes, the bishop of Liverpool, pointed out that millions of people had followed government advice, “stayed at home, coping with difficulty, did the right thing and still do. Vulnerable people are alive today because of the self-discipline of so many. I thank God for their integrity … It is not good enough to treat the people of this country like sheep who can be fooled.” The bishop of Newcastle, Christine Hardman, said: “I am deeply troubled tonight by the prime minister’s briefing. We can forgive mistakes and poor judgment and can understand and admire loyalty but forgiveness and understanding need openness and we did not see this tonight.” Pete Wilcox, the bishop of Sheffield, said: “I don’t usually tweet politics, and I have carefully steered clear during the pandemic. But tonight I must say: the PM & his cabinet are undermining the trust of the electorate and the risks to life are real.” The bishop of Reading, Olivia Graham, said she was “deeply worried by the PM’s judgment call on this one. Not from a political perspective but a moral one. His response lacks both integrity and respect and he has just made his task of leading us through this crisis much, much harder.” Philip Mounstephen, the bishop of Truro, said: “In this country, government and the rule of law depend largely and rightly on the principle of consent. But that depends in turn on the consistency, integrity & impartiality of govt and the application of the law. That is now hugely strained. A moment of real and serious concern.” Emma Ineson, the bishop of Penrith, commented: “Goodness, Dominic Cummings must be really, really valuable to Johnson to be worth what he’s just risked by backing him ie the trust of the British people."
2020-05-24T22:46:44Z,politics,Politics,'What planet are they on?': the papers on the PM's defence of Dominic Cummings,"Boris Johnson’s defence of Dominic Cummings has dominated the front pages of the UK’s media landscape, with newspapers taking varied lines on the prime minister’s decision to excuse his senior aide’s lockdown breaches. The Daily Mail – whose coverage usually backs the prime minister and his government – has taken a particularly strong line against Johnson, simply asking: “What planet are they on?” The Telegraph has stuck closer to its usual pro-Conservative position, quoting Johnson’s defence of his senior aide. The Guardian The Guardian, which revealed Cummings’s lockdown breaches along with the Daily Mirror, leads with “No apology, no explanation”, highlighting the prime minister’s refusal to back down despite public outcry over the aide’s flouting of lockdown rules.
The Daily Mirror The Mirror doesn’t hold back, labelling Cummings “a cheat” while Boris Johnson is marked as “a coward”.
The Daily Mail No holds barred from the Mail either. In a marked departure from its usual line, the paper – usually considered a staunch Tory ally – asks incredulously: “What planet are they on?”, suggesting that the government is out of touch. In a trail of its leader comment piece, the paper actually calls on Johnson to sack his aide. “Dominic Cummings has violated the spirit and letter of the lockdown,” it says. “For the good of the government and the nation, Mr Cummings must resign. Or the prime minister must sack him. No ifs. No buts.”
The Daily Telegraph The Daily Telegraph offers a more supportive headline, quoting Johnson’s words from the daily briefing where he said Cummings acted “responsibly, legally and with integrity”.
The Times The Times echoes the Telegraph in taking a milder line on the debacle, quoting the prime minister’s defence that “Cummings acted like any father”.
The Sun Never one to miss a pun, the Sun has merged two lines from the daily briefing with the headline “Backed to school”, pointing to Johnson’s promise that primary schools in England will reopen in June as well as his support for his chief strategist.
The i The i presents a picture of “Chaos in number 10” following demands from a number of Tory MPs for Cummings’s resignation.
The Daily Express The Daily Express stresses the prime minister’s loyalty to “his man”, calling him “defiant” in the face of calls to sack him.
The Financial Times The FT leads on bailout plans for debt-laden companies, with Cummings and Johnson as the second story."
2020-05-24T21:00:32Z,politics,Politics,Johnson's defence of Cummings sparks anger from allies and opponents alike,"Boris Johnson has staked his political reputation on saving the career of Dominic Cummings, amid growing anger among Conservative MPs that the No 10 chief adviser has not been forced out for breaking lockdown rules. Under intense pressure to explain why Cummings drove his wife, who was suffering coronavirus symptoms, and son 264 miles to his parents’ farm in Durham, the prime minister said on Sunday that Cummings had “acted responsibly, legally and with integrity”. “I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent, and I do not mark him down for that,” Johnson told the daily Downing Street press briefing. But within hours of Johnson’s defence of Cummings, the Guardian and Daily Mirror revealed the aide faces a possible police investigation into allegedly breaking self-isolation and lockdown rules by travelling a further 30 miles to the beauty spot of Barnard Castle. The alleged visit was reported to Durham police by retired chemistry teacher Robin Lees, it can be revealed, and is the latest in a series of Guardian disclosures that have rocked the government and left the Tory party in turmoil It comes as: The prime minister did not deny that Cummings travelled from his parents’ farm to Barnard Castle at a time when non-essential journeys were banned, insisting only that he had self-isolated for 14 days. A second passerby came forward to claim that they saw Cummings in bluebell woods on 19 April, five days after Downing Street says he returned to London and remained in the capital. Nine Tory MPs publicly called on him to go, while three members of a government scientific advisory committee criticised ministers for “trashing” their advice, eroding trust and reducing compliance with lockdown. After spending several hours with Cummings in Downing Street on Sunday, the prime minister told the briefing that his aide had travelled to “try to find the right kind of childcare” and claimed he wanted to reduce the spread of the virus. “I have had extensive face-to-face conversations with Dominic Cummings and I have concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare, at the moment when both he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus - and when he had no alternative - I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent,” Johnson said. Describing some of the allegations against Cummings as “palpably false” – but not saying which – the prime minister continued: “I believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly, legally and with integrity, and with the overriding aim to stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives.”
Three members of SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee providing advice from behavioural scientists to government on how the public might respond to lockdown measures, reacted with disdain to Johnson’s defence of Cummings. Prof Stephen Reicher, of St Andrews University, tweeted: “I can say that in a few short minutes tonight, Boris Johnson has trashed all the advice we have given on how to build trust and secure adherence to the measures necessary to control Covid-19. “Be open and honest, we said. Trashed. Respect the public, we said. Trashed. Ensure equity, so everyone is treated the same, we said. Trashed. Be consistent we said. Trashed. Make clear ‘we are all in it together’. Trashed. “It is very hard to provide scientific advice to a government which doesn’t want to listen to science. I hope, however, that the public will read our papers … and continue to make up for this bad government with their own good sense.” He was backed by Prof Susan Michie and Prof Robert West.
The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said Johnson’s decision to take no action against Cummings was “an insult to sacrifices made by the British people”. The Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon, who accepted the resignation of the country’s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, after she visited a second home during lockdown, said Johnson should follow this example. “I know it is tough to lose a trusted adviser at the height of crisis, but when it’s a choice of that or integrity of vital public health advice, the latter must come first,” she said. “That’s the judgment I and, to her credit, Catherine Calderwood reached. PM and Cummings should do likewise.” Johnson’s unexpected appearance at the press briefing on Sunday – his first in nearly two weeks - was seen by his own MPs as an attempt to protect Cummings following revelations that the adviser had broken the lockdown rules he had helped to write. Johnson did not respond to a series of detailed questions including whether Cummings stopped during the four-hour journey and whether the prime minister had known of Cummings’s trip at the time.
Senior Tory MPs said that the prime minister’s decision to attend the press conference and his inability to answer detailed questions will fuel the furore and will damage his premiership. “The PM is losing his instinct, he might be losing the plot and we could lose the country over this virus,” said one. Reacting to the prime minister’s comments, Sir Roger Gale MP said it was an “extraordinary position” for Johnson to take. “It’s up to the prime minister to exercise judgment about who he has around him,” he told BBC Radio 5 Live. Tim Montgomerie, a former Johnson adviser, tweeted: “Tonight, I’m really embarrassed to have ever backed Boris Johnson for high office.”
MPs including the former minister and 1922 Committee member, Steve Baker, and the chair of the Northern Ireland select committee, Simon Hoare, said Cummings should step aside to stop further damage to the government. Hoare said: “With the damage Mr Cummings is doing to the government’s reputation, he must consider his position. Lockdown has had its challenges for everyone. “It’s his cavalier ‘I don’t care; I’m cleverer than you’ tone that infuriates people. He is now wounding the PM/Govt & I don’t like that.” Anger and dismay was also expressed by Church of England bishops on Twitter after the prime minister’s press conference. The Rt Revd Nick Baines, bishop of Leeds, said: “The question now is: do we accept being lied to, patronised and treated by a PM as mugs? The moral question is not for Cummings - it is for PM and ministers/MPs who find this behaviour acceptable. “What are we to teach our children? (I ask as a responsible father.)” A few minutes earlier, the Rt Revd Dr Helen-Ann Hartley, bishop of Ripon, wrote: “Integrity, trust and leadership were never there; just a driven misguided ideology of power that has total disregard for the most weak and vulnerable, and those who work to protect and care for us with relatively low pay.” Following the press conference, Starmer said: “This was a test of the prime minister and he has failed it. It is an insult to sacrifices made by the British people that Boris Johnson has chosen to take no action against Dominic Cummings. The public will be forgiven for thinking there is one rule for the prime minister’s closest adviser and another for the British people. “The prime minister’s actions have undermined confidence in his own public health message at this crucial time. Millions were watching for answers and they got nothing. That’s why the cabinet secretary must now launch an urgent inquiry.”
Leaving Downing Street after about six hours in No 10 on Sunday, Cummings refused to answer questions. Earlier, police officers had visited his north London home in response to media gathering outside. A jogger reported that he saw Cummings on 19 April, five days after Downing Street says he returned to London from Durham and did not return. Ministers had denied reports in the Guardian and Daily Mirror that Cummings was seen looking at bluebells in woods near Houghall, close to his family’s property on the outskirts of Durham, that day. Our source stood by their claim, and Tim Matthews, a runner, later came forward to claim that he too may have seen Cummings later that day. Matthews tweeted a photo to a route from the running app Strava that he had dubbed “Brick Run aka Dominic Cummings Spotting Run”. It marks the area where he saw Cummings at 3.45pm on 19 April. He tweeted: “Here’s my two potential sightings Riverbanks and Houghall Woods – I’ve been banging on about them ever since.”
Meanwhile Cummings is facing a possible police investigation under health laws over a claim that he breached self-isolation rules by allegedly visiting Barnard Castle on 12 April. Lees made a complaint by email to police on Sunday after reporting that he saw Cummings and his family walking in the town before getting into a car. The alleged sighting of Cummings in the town appeared to come while he was still ill, according to his own account. Writing in the Spectator last month, Cummings said: “At the end of March and for the first two weeks of April I was ill, so we [Cummings and his wife] were both shut in together.” Johnson did not dispute that his adviser had made a trip to the Tees Valley beauty spot. Asked directly about the visit, the prime minister said: “When you look at the guidance, when you look at the particular childcare needs that Mr Cummings faced at the time, it was reasonable of him to self-isolate as he did for 14 days or more with his family where he did. I think that was sensible and defensible and I understand it.” Durham police has yet to respond to complaint but the Guardian understands the force is considering whether it needs to take any further action in relation to Cummings. As well as Lees’ complaint, the leader of the Liberal Democrats group on Durham County Council has demanded the police open an investigation into whether Cummings broke the 2020 Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations. • This article was amended on 25 June 2020 to further clarify that jogger Tim Matthews was not the source for the Guardian’s original reporting of an alleged sighting of Dominic Cummings near Durham on 19 April and that Matthews had described his as a possible sighting."
2020-05-24T19:29:27Z,politics,Politics,Defending Cummings: questions answered - and skirted over,"Boris Johnson resolutely defended Dominic Cummings when the furore over him forced an unscheduled appearance at the coronavirus press briefing on Sunday. But while the prime minister, speaking at the daily Downing Street conference, said he thought that Cummings had acted “responsibly, legally and with integrity”, he left many questions unanswered, skirted around key issues and provoked fresh fury among Tory MPs and political opponents alike.
Johnson insisted Cummings had not broken any guidelines by travelling to Durham for childcare reasons Mr Cummings did isolate for 14 days or more and the circumstances of his self-isolation were determined by the difficult childcare position that he found himself in ... the guidance makes it very clear that where you have particular childcare needs that has got to be taken into account. Johnson did not make clear which guidance he was referring to. Cummings’ home is in London, and the government rules at the time were specific – stay at home.
The prime minister himself had implored people not to travel and visit relatives. Cabinet Office advice was also emphatic: “Leaving your home – the place you live – to stay at another home for a holiday or other purpose is not allowed. This includes visiting second homes.” Asked by reporters on Saturday for her reading of the exemptions in the coronavirus guidelines, the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, suggested that an exemption would be “unless there is an extreme risk to life”. Nobody has suggested this was the case with Cummings and his family. Johnson did not explain how Cummings got to Durham in the first place. Was it by car? If so, did he stop on the way? By train? If so, was he with other passengers? Nor was there any detailed explanation for why the couple’s childcare needs could only be catered for with a 260-mile trip to Durham, rather than in London. Johnson said some of the allegations made against Cummings were false and that he had acted to stop the spread of the virus Though there have been many other allegations about what happened when he was in self-isolation and thereafter, some of them palpably false, I believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly and legally and with integrity and with the overwhelming aim of stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives. Again, Johnson did not specify which of the allegations he regarded as “palpably false”. But when he was asked a direct question about whether Cummings had taken a trip to Barnard Castle during his stay in Durham, Johnson ignored the question, and said that what Cummings had done more generally was “sensible and defensible”. He said Cummings had been in self isolation for “14 days or more” and had behaved responsibly.
But if Cummings did go to Barnard Castle on 12 April, as the Guardian reported, that would seem to be a very clear and obvious breach of the lockdown guidelines, whether or not his 14-day period of isolation was at an end.
Barnard Castle is close to 30 miles from the house where Cummings was staying. It is exactly the kind of day trip that ministers, in briefing after briefing, have urged millions of people not to make but to “stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives”. Johnson said Cummings had behaved as any parent would have done, and denied it was one rule for some and another rule for others Is this government asking you – the people, the public – to do one thing, while senior people here in government do something else?… I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent. And I do not mark him down for that.” The PM’s defence of Cummings’s paternal instincts begged an obvious question that he did not answer. Do instincts come before rules and guidelines? As the Tory MP, David Warburton, tweeted shortly after the briefing: “We’ve all been tasked with tempering our parental, and other, instincts by strictly adhering to govt guidance.” Tim Montgomerie, creator of the ConservativeHome website, went further. “In a pandemic the messages the government puts out have to respected. And if you have a key adviser flouting those rules and no apology, that is a terrible failure on the part of government. That is a terrible undermining of government communications. We have come to realise how reliant Boris Johnson is on Dominic Cummings as an adviser. I’m afraid he has chosen to stick with him. If Johnson loses Cummings, he risks losing the whole operation he has surrounded himself with.” In a tweet, the Labour MP Jess Phillips said: “The instincts of most other fathers in the country was to look after their partner and children at home.”"
2020-05-24T19:11:20Z,politics,Politics,"No dignity, no future: Boris forsakes leadership to protect Cummings | John Crace","Look on the bright side: at least we’ve had it confirmed who is actually running the country these days. And it isn’t the prime minister. Boris Johnson is no more than Dominic Cummings’s sock-puppet. A fairly shabby one at that. The reality is that without Classic Dom, there could be no Boris. All that Boris really amounts to is a parasitical ball of compromised ambition fuelled by a viral overload of neediness and cowardice. There is no substance or dignity left within the prime minister. His only instinct is his own survival. The equation was quite simple. If Dom was to be fired, then Boris would have to fire himself, because it is inconceivable that the ersatz prime minister didn’t know the de facto prime minister had broken the lockdown rules by doing a runner to Durham. But just in case Boris had been in any doubt, Dom had arrived at Downing Street four hours before the daily coronavirus press conference to remind him who was boss. There were to be no sackings and no resignations. Not yet anyway. There may be in the days to come. Not that Boris had actually wanted to front up the No 10 briefing. It was just that every other cabinet minister had phoned in to say they were self-isolating in their second homes. Or in Robert Jenrick’s case, his third home. Right from the off, Boris had looked rattled. The self-styled great communicator has lost the power of language and can now only talk in staccato bursts of incomprehensible Morse code. Even more disastrously, he is the populist politician who has lost track of the mood of the people. His survival skills have deserted him. The country is spitting blood at the arrogance of one rule for the elite and another for the rest, and Boris is totally oblivious. Breathless and pasty-faced, his eyes still bloodshot after his talking-to by Dom, Boris leapt to his boss’s defence. He hadn’t been able to throw a protective ring around care homes, but he sure as hell was going to throw one round Cummings. Classic Dom had done nothing wrong at all. In fact, he had done what any father would do and drive to his second home. Mostly because he was so short of friends that he had no one within a 260-mile radius who could leave food parcels for his child. Oddly, that was one of the few statements that sounded vaguely convincing. The rest of his opening remarks were incoherent drivel. Dom had driven the length of the country to escape the virus. Even though he was taking it with him in the car and almost certainly contracted it during the enclosed proximity to his wife. It was as though Boris thought the virus could only travel at 50 mph, so if Dom drove at 70mph up the M1, then he could outrun it. Dom had had no alternative. Indeed, if the de facto prime minister had a fault, it was that he loved his family too much. All those single mothers and workshy parents without second homes were basically heartless and uncaring for staying put and obeying the government advice on self-isolation. Dom: the man who loved too much. Boris then wittered on a bit about schools – mysteriously, he seemed to forget the dualling of the A66 that Grant Shapps had been so desperate to talk about during the morning media round – but all the questions concentrated on how and how often Dom had chosen to arbitrarily break the rules. Here Boris started to get sweaty and petulant. He was standing by Dom and that was that. He didn’t have to give a credible reason because he was the World King who wrote all the rules. Bizarrely, he even described Dom as responsible. Cummings won’t be at all happy about that. His whole self-image is based upon him being the great anti-establishment disruptor; the person to whom rules don’t apply. Not some establishment posh boy who toed the line at all times. God save the Queen! Her fascist regime. Then Boris was unwittingly making sure that both he and Dom had no future. The press conference he had hoped would draw a line under Dom’s midnight – no toilet or snack breaks – flits to his hideout merely served to ensure they would dominate the news agenda for weeks. Boris had had a chance to show genuine leadership and completely flunked it. He refused to answer any questions about whether he knew Dom had done a runner – just imagine Boris working from Downing Street imagining his host body was holed up in north London – or when he discovered that Dom was in Durham. Not because he didn’t know, but because he genuinely thought it didn’t matter. Boris is a true believer in his own exceptionalism, a trait that he graciously extends to those who are close to him. He genuinely doesn’t see a problem with not obeying a rule himself that he has asked the rest of the country to follow. So what if Dom and his family might have risked infecting a few dozen inconsequential little people? Sacrifice is what other, lesser people do. Nor was there even an attempt to answer the allegations about Dom’s other alleged extracurricular outings to Barnard Castle or the bluebell woods. In saving Dom – for the time being at least – Boris had tossed away the credibility of his own government. He has been stripped bare and exposed as not very bright, lacking in judgment and completely amoral. Within an hour, he had not only defended the indefensible, he had basically told the nation they were free to do as they please. If there is a second coronavirus peak, Boris will have even more blood on his hands. He’d even made Shapps’s TV appearances look vaguely statesmanlike. That bad. At a time of national crisis, we have a prime minister who makes Henry Kissinger look worthy of a Nobel peace prize. Satire is now dead."
2020-05-24T18:43:36Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings facing possible police investigation as pressure mounts,"Dominic Cummings is facing a possible police investigation under health laws over a claim that he breached self-isolation rules in north-east England, after a weekend of mounting pressure on the prime minister to sack his chief adviser. Retired chemistry teacher Robin Lees made a complaint to the police after reporting that he saw Cummings and his family on 12 April walking in the town of Barnard Castle before getting into a car, a joint investigation by the Guardian and Mirror can reveal. Lees’ alleged sighting of Cummings in the town – 30 miles from Durham, where the aide had been self-isolating after developing Covid-19 symptoms – appeared to come while he was still ill, according to his own account. Writing in the Spectator last month, Cummings said: “At the end of March and for the first two weeks of April, I was ill, so we [Cummings and his wife] were both shut in together.” At a Downing Street press conference dominated by questions about Cummings’s movements during the lockdown, Boris Johnson did not dispute that his adviser had made a trip to the Tees Valley beauty spot. Asked directly about the Barnard Castle visit, Johnson said: “When you look at the guidance, when you look at the particular childcare needs that Mr Cummings faced at the time, it was reasonable of him to self-isolate as he did for 14 days or more with his family where he did. I think that was sensible and defensible and I understand it.” Lees said Johnson should have provided clearer answers. In an email to Durham police sent before the Sunday press conference, he alleged a breach of health protection regulations that officers will be obliged to investigate.
It said: “At the time, I felt the three people getting in the car might be breaking lockdown rules. However, in light of recent information, I feel that as well as an important breach of the lockdown, there may also have been concerns over Health Protection regulations.” He also provided the number plate of the car he saw Cummings drive away in. The email said: “I assume you are able to view CCTV to ascertain whether this vehicle travelled locally or from further away.” Responding to Johnson’s appearance at the press conference, Lees said: “Asked directly if he visited Barnard Castle, he didn’t answer it, because now I’m totally convinced he can’t. He wasn’t clear whether Cummings had the virus or when he drove to Durham. He wasn’t clear on any details of the 14-day quarantine. He needs to be clear when symptoms started and when they finished.”
Durham police have yet to respond to Lees’ email, but the Guardian understands the force is considering whether it needs to take any further action in relation to Cummings. As well as Lees’ complaint, the leader of the Liberal Democrats group on Durham County Council has demanded that the police open an investigation into whether Cummings broke the 2020 Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations. Councillor Amanda Hopgood said she had written to chief constable Jo Farrell because there was a clear public interest in establishing the truth and seeing if lockdown regulations had been breached, potentially on multiple occasions. Hopgood said: “I have sent a letter to the chief constable asking them to see if [Cummings] has committed an offence under section 15 of the health protection coronavirus regulations. “I would hope the chief constable would investigate to see if an offence has been committed. There have been so many different versions of what has happened, an independent investigation by the police is needed.” Durham police are now expected to assess the complaints they have received and decide whether further action, such as an investigation, is needed. Among senior police figures there was ridicule of the claim that Cummings’s decision to act on “instinct” justified his actions. One source closely involved in lockdown policing said: “That is a new one on me.” One senior police figure said the rules about not travelling were crystal clear."
2020-05-24T18:06:29Z,politics,Politics,'Truth twisters': rogue civil service tweet causes storm,"It was a sentiment perhaps shared by at least some people who had watched Boris Johnson’s press conference, but not necessarily what you might expect from the official account of the civil service. “Arrogant and offensive,” read the tweet from the @UKCivilService Twitter account, which has just over 250,000 followers. “Can you imagine having to work with these truth twisters?” The tweet elaborated no further, but given that it was sent soon after Johnson had finished a sometimes extraordinary press briefing at which he had vigorously defended his under-fire chief aide, Dominic Cummings, the implication was fairly clear.
A delighted Twitter shared the message tens of thousands of times before it was deleted, leaving the civil service account to its usual, more sober stream of messages about ways for businesses to cope with lockdown and other practical issues. A government spokesman said: “An unauthorised tweet was posted on a government channel this evening. The post has been removed and we are investigating the matter.” At the press conference, Johnson had dismissed criticism of Cummings’ decision to drive more than 260 miles to his parents’ estate in Durham with his wife and young son after his wife became ill, saying Cummings had been trying to keep his family safe. “I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent,” Johnson said. “And I do not mark him down for that.” The prime minister added: “I believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly, legally and with integrity, and with the overriding aim of stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives.”"
2020-05-24T16:34:06Z,politics,Politics,Anger across Britain at Dominic Cummings's 260-mile lockdown trek,"After the Guardian and Daily Mirror revealed Dominic Cummings’s 260-mile journey from London to Durham as his wife and then he came down with coronavirus symptoms, frontline workers and bereaved relatives expressed their anger and frustration. The A&E doctor: “I became sick with Covid-19 in March. My wife was also sick. We have three kids and stayed home to look after them. Because that was the rule. Back at work I dressed in full PPE to look after the sick and dying. I didn’t do all of that so Dominic Cummings could flout the rules.” – Dr Farbod Babolhavaeji
The headteacher: “My mother died of Covid-19, alone in a care home in Sussex on 18 April 2020. I was unable to visit her during the last few weeks and days of her life because of the lockdown measures imposed by your government, advised by Dominic Cummings. It now appears that Cummings not only broke the lockdown rules himself, he did so flagrantly. His response today has been arrogance personified. “When I did, finally, make a 520-mile round trip from York to Sussex and back to see my mother, it was to bury her body. I completed the 520-mile round trip in a single day because I thought staying at my sister’s house in Sussex contravened the lockdown rules. I am sure you can appreciate why I am appalled at Cummings’s disregard for the lockdown rules he had a hand in making. Please make my story known to No 10; there are thousands of similar stories across the land.” – John Tomsett, head teacher of Huntingdon School, York in a letter to his Conservative MP.
The protester: “I’m not with any organisation or campaign, just a member of the public. I’ve been furloughed and I was just sat at home angry and frustrated. I think it’s disgusting. It’s one rule for him and the rest of us. It’s disgraceful how the government is protecting him. I’ve been at home with my wife for two months. But thinking of all the people who’ve made big sacrifices and not seen their loved ones.” – Ben, 31, marketing manager protesting outside Cummings’s north London home on Sunday. The palliative care doctor: “If Dominic Cummings isn’t gone by the end of today, @BorisJohnson is insulting every grieving relative I have had to call to explain why they can’t visit their dying loved one in hospital. Every distraught family member not at a funeral. Every frontline carer risking their life.” – Rachel Clarke The bereaved politician: “Dominic Cummings walks outside my house while I keep the rules and don’t go and see my dad in a care home in the town and he dies five days later. It’s a horror movie.” – Helen Goodman, former Labour MP for Bishop Auckland. The businesswoman: “So my partner and I both had coronavirus symptoms at the same time. We have two children. We all stayed in the flat for 10-14 days and relied on neighbours to leave food by the front door. Turns out we could have driven to Bristol and left the kids with my sister.” – Julia Bellis"
2020-05-24T16:28:14Z,politics,Politics,"Defence of Dominic Cummings is shameful, says ex-Durham police chief","The former chief constable of Durham police has launched a strident attack on Dominic Cummings and the government defending him, branding them self-privileged hypocrites who have damaged the fight against coronavirus at a time of national emergency. Mike Barton, who stepped down as chief constable last year, said the government’s defence of Boris Johnson’s chief adviser – who travelled from London to Durham after his wife came down with Covid-19 symptoms – was causing extensive damage as police try to get the public to obey lockdown rules. He told the Guardian: “It is clear he has broken the rules. It could not be clearer. I cannot think of a worse example of a breach of the lockdown rules. For it then to be defended by the government just beggars belief.” Barton said the rules were clear: that anyone with symptoms of coronavirus should not leave their home. “What is particularly sad and undermines completely the government position is they seem to be operating in a bubble of self-privilege and denial when they all should be leading by example. ‘Hypocrite’ was invented for these circumstances … Of course it is double standards.” Barton added: “It feels like feudal times. We make the rules and it is for you, the great unwashed, to follow them.”
It has emerged that police were unaware Cummings had travelled to his parents’ farm in Durham with his wife and son at the end of March, until his father informed them. Robert Cummings asked a friend to contact officers because he wanted security advice. Months earlier, he got security advice in relation to his son from Durham police, but had mislaid the contact details, it is understood. On 31 March, Robert Cummings contacted someone who he knew had details of a senior officer in the Durham force, and that senior officer arranged for Special Branch to contact Cummings’s father. During that call, advice was given by the Special Branch officer on both security and physical distancing under lockdown rules. The Durham force is understood to have been dismayed by a Downing Street statement on Saturday which wrongly claimed police had not spoken to anyone from the Cummings family about his journey from London. Cummings’s father was spoken to again by police earlier this month after they became aware of fresh claims on social media and media inquiries about whether the aide had again been seen in the Durham area. Cummings Snr denied the claim, and said his son was not present at the family farm. Police accepted his word. In a statement issued on Saturday evening, Durham police said: “On Tuesday, 31 March, our officers were made aware that Dominic Cummings had travelled from London to Durham and was present at an address in the city. At the request of Mr Cummings’ father, an officer made contact the following morning by telephone. “During that conversation, Mr Cummings’ father confirmed that his son had travelled with his family from London to the north-east and was self-isolating in part of the property.” In a statement issued on Friday, Durham police had said: “In line with national policing guidance, officers explained to the family the guidelines around self-isolation and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel.” No further action was taken. Barton attacked the government’s defence of Cummings, including the performance by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, at the daily Downing Street briefing on Saturday. “The government are coming out with weasel words and sophistry,” Barton said. “For Mr Shapps to be obviously making it up as he goes long shames the government, shames him and shames us all as a country. It is blatantly stupid what they are suggesting.” Under Barton’s leadership, the Durham force was rated as one of the best-performing in the country by official inspectors. Jo Farrell, the current chief constable, who is dealing with the Cummings allegations, was Barton’s deputy. Barton warned of wider and serious consequences, saying: “They [ministers] have driven a coach and horses through these crucial guidelines at a time of national emergency, simply to save the skin of one of their own. “This is not just Dominic Cummings. This is many members of the cabinet supporting someone who has clearly broken the guidelines, their guidelines, at a time of national emergency. I find it amazing they are changing the rules to save his skin.” The former chief constable warned it would make the police’s job harder: “I feel for the thousands of officers negotiating to get people to do what they do not want to do. This makes the job of policing the lockdown harder. It gives a green light for people to do what they want.” He warned that the Conservatives, who gained power after winning seats in Labour’s traditional northern heartlands, were damaging themselves. “They are on probation,” he said. “People who voted for them, I’m not sure they wanted to bring into power this conceited self-privilege that has been on display for the past 48 hours.” Barton said his former force had handled the matter well. Under his leadership, Durham police pioneered alternatives to prosecutions and Barton said prosecuting or fining Cummings would have been pointless. He said: “Fining people does not bring the R rate down. What brings it down is people following the rules.” Durham police tried to avoid punishing people for lockdown breaches. It has been one of the forces to issue the fewest fines, at about 137 between 27 March and 11 May, compared with North Yorkshire police’s 843."
2020-05-24T16:14:58Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson backs Dominic Cummings in face of Tory calls for chief aide to resign,"Boris Johnson has pledged his complete support for Dominic Cummings over a trip to a distant family home during the peak of the lockdown, using a Downing Street press conference to insist his chief adviser “acted responsibly, legally and with integrity”. Facing intense pressure to explain why Cummings appeared to have flouted lockdown rules by driving more than 260 miles to his parents’ estate in Durham with his wife and young son after his wife became ill, the prime minister said Cummings had simply been trying to keep his family safe. “I have had extensive face-to-face conversations with Dominic Cummings and I have concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare, at the moment when both he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus – and when he had no alternative – I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent,” Johnson said. “And I do not mark him down for that.” Calling some of the allegations against Cummings “palpably false” – but not saying which – Johnson continued: “I believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly, legally and with integrity, and with the overriding aim to stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives.” Johnson often appeared to struggle, however, when asked about Cummings’s actions, with almost every question devoted to the subject. He ignored part of a question which asked whether it was true that Cummings had been spotted in Barnard Castle, about 30 miles from Durham, during the period coinciding with his lockdown. He also said Cummings’s actions did not imply a loosening of restrictions. The prime minister insisted that Cummings’s trip was in line with restrictions on movement in place at the time, and that people could use their own discretion in similar circumstances.
“Looking at the very severe childcare difficulties that presented themselves to Dominic Cummings and his family, I think that what they did was totally understandable,” he said. “He found those needs where they could best be served, best be delivered and yes that did involve travel.” “As far as I can see, he stuck to the rules and he acted legally and responsibly with the sole objective of avoiding such contact as would spread the virus. His objective was to stop the spread of the virus and he behaved in such a way as to do that.” His comments prompted condemnation from opposition MPs. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat interim leader, said the public would be “astonished and angry at how the prime minister is now bending the rules for his closest aide”. “By failing to act, the prime minister undermines his own authority to lead the country through this appalling crisis, bringing his own judgement into question,” he said. Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, tweeted that Johnson “said Cummings was following his instincts, the rest of the country was following the rules. Where does that leave us if everyone now is to follow their instincts?”
Such a vehement and robust show of support for his powerful adviser puts Johnson on a collision course with increasing numbers of Conservative backbenchers, who have said Cummings’s actions risked losing public support for lockdown measures. MPs including the former minister and 1922 Committee member, Steve Baker, and the chair of the Northern Ireland select committee, Simon Hoare, said Cummings should step aside to stop further damage to the government. Hoare said: “With the damage Mr Cummings is doing to the government’s reputation he must consider his position. Lockdown has had its challenges for everyone. “It’s his cavalier ‘I don’t care; I’m cleverer than you’ tone that infuriates people. He is now wounding the PM/Govt & I don’t like that,” he wrote on Twitter. Roger Gale, the MP for North Thanet, joined the chorus of Tory backbenchers calling for Cummings to resign. He tweeted: “While as a father and as a grandfather I fully appreciate Mr Cummings’s desire to protect his child, there cannot be one law for the prime minister’s staff and another for everyone else.”"
2020-05-24T16:07:59Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings timeline: what we know about his movements,"When Dominic Cummings was photographed sprinting out of Downing Street on the same day the prime minister and the health secretary were reported to have developed symptoms of coronavirus, observers might have assumed he was racing to attend to vital matters of state. In retrospect, many will ask whether he was just trying to beat the traffic. Over the last 72 hours, Downing Street officials, unnamed sources and ministers have attempted to cast doubt on parts of the timeline of Cummings’s travels. But an examination of the public record, placed alongside the Guardian and Daily Mirror’s reporting, means that it is possible to lay out the significant claims and counter-claims of the period in question – and where questions still remain. Friday 27 March: Downing Street On the day Cummings ran out of No 10, his wife, Mary Wakefield, appears to have been already ill, according to her Spectator article about the experience, in which she says: “My husband did rush home to look after me.” The article did not mention that soon after he rushed home, the family went to the other end of the country. The government has briefed that Cummings travelled north before developing symptoms of the virus, which is said to have struck him over the weekend of 28-29 March. Wakefield wrote that Cummings said “I feel weird” and collapsed 24 hours after he came home to look after her, placing their journey north on Friday – perhaps trying to beat the weekend getaway – or Saturday at the latest. The details of the journey from London remain unclear. Did he drive or take the train? On Sunday, the cabinet minister Grant Shapps didn’t know. He was asked whether Cummings had stopped for a break at any point on the four-hour journey accompanied by a small child and a sick wife. Despite being given notice of the question by Sky’s Sophy Ridge the evening before, and having been in contact with Cummings, Shapps was caught flat-footed. “I’m afraid I don’t have detail to the point of what time of day, and how many stops,” he said, adding that he was “expert” in transport matters and would prefer to talk about the A66.
In its defence of Cummings, No 10 said the couple had had to travel north in search of childcare from Cummings’s sister and nieces at the property owned by his parents. The former Downing Street director of communications Alastair Campbell, among others, described this as guff. He said it was unbelievable that Cummings had to travel 264 miles to get help with childcare. But, in the end, Cummings and his wife did not need childcare, No 10 have said, instead relying on the family to deliver food to their door. Tuesday 31 March: Durham The police have said that on 31 March they were “made aware of reports” of Cummings’s presence in the area. On Friday, Durham Constabulary told the Guardian and Daily Mirror that they had then contacted the family to “reiterate the appropriate advice around essential travel”. The statement confirmed – for the first time – that Cummings had left London for the north-east. But on Saturday, Downing Street insisted the police were wrong. No 10 said that “at no stage was Cummings or his family spoken to by the police about this matter”. This version is now under intense scrutiny. Under pressure to explain the differing accounts, police issued a new statement on Saturday and stood by by the original claim. Not just that, it seems the police might have been alerted to Cummings’s presence in Durham by – his father. And that it was during this conversation that police had “reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel”. By Sunday morning, Shapps was disputing a subtly different point. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr: “For one thing the father contacted the police, not the other way round” and claiming that security was the “key thing” in the conversation. Sunday 5 April: The ‘Abba’ sighting The following days, by Wakefield’s account, were a mixture of family idyll and health nightmare, as she made a “palace out of polystyrene packaging” with their son even as Cummings’s breathing got so bad that she feared he should be in hospital. But 10 days after her husband first fell ill, she said, he began to feel better – just as Boris Johnson went into hospital. That would place the improvement in his condition around Sunday 5 April, although 10 days after the 28th – the earliest point at which Cummings was said to have been symptomatic – was 7 April. That Sunday, a passerby told the Guardian, they spotted Cummings by sheer chance. The encounter was fleeting but memorable: Cummings was standing outside with his little boy, in “dark coat and thick tartan scarf”, and Abba was playing at full blast. On the same day, the Guardian asked Downing Street about the claims. “It’ll be a ‘no comment’ on that one,” an official responded. On the Friday of the same week, after establishing further details, the Guardian asked again. Again, the response was no comment. Sunday 12 April: Barnard Castle Wakefield did not mention that on 12 April – her birthday, according to Companies House records – they allegedly made a trip to Barnard Castle, a charming town 30 miles from the Cummings’s family property, described on the English Heritage website as having “fantastic views” and “plenty to do for families on a day out”. That detail emerged in an interview with Robin Lees, a retired chemistry teacher who lives in the town. Lees, who says he has a photographic memory, told the Guardian he was “a bit gobsmacked” to see Cummings, and then was so incensed that he made a note of the family car’s numberplate and checked it online when he got home. While government officials spent weeks refusing to talk about Cummings’s whereabouts, and have since Saturday sought to dismiss the joint investigation as “fake news” and “a stream of false allegations … from campaigning newspapers”, they have not disputed Lees’s account. His account is awkward for No 10. On Saturday, Shapps – like other Conservatives who defended the prime minister’s most senior aide – repeatedly emphasised that after the Cummings family had made their journey across the country, they had “stayed put”. Not according to Lees, they hadn’t. On Sunday, Shapps appeared to change tack.
He seemed to say that this trip would have come at the end of the quarantine period. No mention, however, of the fact this trip would seem to be a clear breach of the strict lockdown rules in place at the time. Would a journey to a popular day-trip destination on a loved one’s birthday, 30 miles from the lockdown location, constitute essential travel or compliance with the government’s “stay home” instruction? That Easter weekend, a new government campaign reminded people that even at a time when people might wish to spend time together, the rules still applied. “The new campaign reinforces the importance of staying at home over Easter,” it said, reiterating the importance of “only leaving your house to buy essentials, to do one form of exercise a day, to travel into work, but only where you cannot work from home, and for any medical or social care need”. Tuesday 14 April: London The 14-day period of Cummings’s isolation would have expired on 10 April, assuming it is counted from when Wakefield appears to have first fallen ill on 27 March. . In a piece for the Spectator, the magazine she works for, Wakefield wrote: “We emerged from quarantine into the almost comical uncertainty of London lockdown.” No clarification, however, that they had actually emerged into the capital from Durham. The Guardian asked Wakefield to confirm whether the family had been in London throughout the lockdown period, but received no reply. Cummings was photographed back in Downing Street on 14 April, clutching a bag containing a carton of soup, a tangerine and a carrot. Sunday 19 April: ‘bluebell’ woods Could Cummings have then gone back to the north-east from London? Downing Street is emphatic that he did not. The denial came after another witness claimed to the Guardian and Sunday Mirror that they had seen Cummings and Wakefield on a country walk in Houghall Woods, a beauty spot near his parents’ property in Durham. According to this account, Cummings said: “Aren’t the bluebells lovely?” While Downing Street would give no on-the-record comment before publication of the new stories on Saturday, it then issued a statement. It accused the Guardian and the Mirror of writing “inaccurate stories … including claims that Mr Cummings returned to Durham after returning to work in Downing Street on 14 April. We will not waste our time answering a stream of false allegations about Mr Cummings from campaigning newspapers.” In interviews on Sunday, Shapps said he understood the sighting in the woods was false. But there has still been no direct on-the-record denial from Cummings himself. The witness who says they saw him on that day, in that place, is sticking by their story, but had nothing more to add."
2020-05-24T14:18:42Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings faces growing pressure to resign from Tory MPs,"A growing number of senior Conservatives are demanding the resignation of Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, over allegations that he broke the government’s lockdown rules on several occasions. MPs including the former minister and 1922 Committee member, Steve Baker, and the chair of a select committee, Simon Hoare, said he should step aside to stop further damage to the government over its response to the coronavirus outbreak. Party whips spent Saturday night calling backbenchers in an effort to shore up support following Guardian revelations that Cummings was spotted at a Teesside town more than 20 miles from his parents’ home in Durham. One backbencher said the calls were a “desperate measure” to garner the support of MPs to save the job of the special adviser. In an article for The Critic magazine, the former minister Steve Baker said the architect of the Vote Leave campaign should stand aside after travelling hundreds of miles with his son and wife, who had coronavirus symptoms, and then travelling to a nearby town. “Dominic Cummings must go before he does any more harm to the UK, the government, the prime minister, our institutions or the Conservative party,” Baker wrote of his fellow Brexiter. “Today’s newspapers are a disaster. Enormous political capital is being expended saving someone who has boasted of making decisions beyond his competence and who clearly broke at the very least the guidance which kept mums and dads at home, without childcare from their parents, and instead risked spreading the virus by travelling. “It is intolerable that Boris, Boris’s government and Boris’s programme should be harmed in this way,” he wrote. Baker’s comments follow disclosures in the Guardian/Observer and the Daily and Sunday Mirror that Cummings had travelled to his family’s home in Durham in breach of the lockdown rules, and was later spotted at Barnard Castle, 30 miles away.
In an analysis of Cummings’ working methods, Baker said his former colleague has revealed an arrogance that was apparent when he ran the Vote Leave campaign. “As far as I am aware, among those who work with, rather than for him, only Michael Gove enjoys Dom’s respect. “So it is hardly surprising when mums and dads were going without the childcare provided by their parents – perhaps while they were isolating for seven and 14 days with Covid-19 symptoms – that Dominic was suiting himself with a long drive, presumably with stops, to get help during his illness,” Baker wrote. Baker has been joined by Simon Hoare, the senior Tory MP from the centre of the party and chair of the Northern Ireland select committee, who has also called for him to consider his position. “With the damage Mr Cummings is doing to the government’s reputation he must consider his position. Lockdown has had its challenges for everyone. “It’s his cavalier ‘I don’t care; I’m cleverer than you’ tone that infuriates people. He is now wounding the PM/Govt & I don’t like that,” he wrote on Twitter. Sir Roger Gale, the Conservative MP for North Thanet, joined the chorus of backbenchers calling for Cummings to resign. He tweeted: “While as a father and as a grandfather I fully appreciate Mr Cummings’ desire to protect his child. There cannot be one law for the Prime Minister’s staff and another for everyone else. “He has sent out completely the wrong message and his position is no longer tenable.” Damian Collins, the former chair of the culture select committee and MP for Folkestone and Hythe, said: “Dominic Cummings has a track record of believing that the rules don’t apply to him and treating the scrutiny that should come to anyone in a position of authority with contempt. “The government would be better without him.” The chair of the women and equality select committee, Caroline Nokes, said she told the whips on Saturday that Cummings should go. “I made my views clear to my whip yesterday. There cannot be one rule for most of us and wriggle room for others. My inbox is rammed with very angry constituents and I do not blame them. They have made difficult sacrifices over the course of the last nine weeks,” she said on Twitter. Craig Whittaker, the MP for Calder Valley, said: “I totally agree that Dominic Cummings’ position is untenable. I’m sure he took the decision in the best interests of his family but like every decision we take we also have to take responsibility for those decisions. You cannot advise the nation one thing then do the opposite.” The former defence minister Tobias Ellwood also warned the government “the ship is being blown off course”. He wrote on Twitter: “Time for a formal address from the captain offering firm leadership, command and control to resolve setbacks, reunite collective resolve and rebuild mission focus.” The MP Sir Robert Syms also said on Twitter that a government adviser should not become the story. He said: “Whatever the merits of a Govt Advisor they should never be the story or it detracts from central message which is to get us out of this crisis. The advisor should go.” Meanwhile, Robert Halfon, the chair of the education select committee and a former minister, withdrew his public support for Cummings and instead said the adviser should ‘face serious consequences’ if he has broken the rules. In a supportive tweet on Saturday, he wrote: “Ill couple drive 260 miles to ensure their small child can be looked after. In some quarters this is regarded as the crime of the century.” But speaking to yourharlow.com on Sunday, he said: “I regret writing the tweet yesterday in the way I did about the No 10 political adviser and his movements. I am really sorry for it. I do not support, or condone anyone who has broken the law or regulations. ”It is important for everyone to follow public health advice, that includes members of the government and their advisers. If those regulations or laws have been breached there should be serious consequences.” Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, was sent out to defend Cummings on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show. He denied Cummings had driven back and forth from London to Durham on more than one occasion, but said he did not know whether Cummings had visited Barnard Castle. “I’m afraid I don’t know [about Barnard Castle] but if that date was true that would have been outside the 14-day period. But I’m afraid I don’t have the information on that. “But I do know it is not the case that he has travelled backwards and forwards, which seemed to be a major part of the stories I saw in the paper today.” Pressed by Marr on whether there was an “extreme risk to life”, Shapps said: “A four-year-old can’t feed themselves, a four-year-old can’t bathe themselves and change their clothes, so it is clear they wanted to put some measures in place.” On Saturday, England’s deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, said everyone should self-isolate unless there was a risk to life. Johnson pledged his “full support” on Saturday to his chief adviser, who it emerged had travelled 260 miles to the north-east in March to self-isolate with his family while official guidelines warned against long-distance journeys. Ministers insisted Cummings had stayed put once arriving at a property in Durham, where he had travelled after contracting the symptoms of coronavirus to seek the support from his extended family. Two new witnesses of Cummings’s movements in north-east england were revealed on Saturday in a joint investigation by the Guardian/Observer and the Sunday Mirror. One witness saw him in Durham on 19 April, days after Cummings was photographed in London having recovered from the virus. A week earlier, Cummings was seen by another witness in Barnard Castle on Easter Day, 30 miles away from Durham, the investigation found. The town, which takes its name from the English Heritage site at its centre, is a popular destination for days out. Robin Lees, 70, a retired chemistry teacher from the town, said he saw Cummings and his family walking by the Tees before getting into a car around lunchtime on 12 April. When Cummings was apparently recognised a second time on 19 April, he was wearing his trademark beanie hat, and was heard commenting on how “lovely” the bluebells were during an early morning Sunday stroll with his wife, Mary Wakefield. The second witness, who declined to be named, said: “We were shocked and surprised to see him because the last time we did was earlier in the week in Downing Street.” Cummings had been photographed on 14 April in Downing Street, the first time he had been seen back at work since recovering from the virus."
2020-05-24T13:44:45Z,politics,Politics,New UK legal advice could open door to Hong Kong citizens,"A UK government claim that insurmountable legal obligations to China prevent ministers offering a right of abode to tens of thousands of Hong Kong citizens has been blown apart by new legal advice handed to Conservative MPs. The advice by one of the UK’s most prominent immigration QCs is likely to shift the mood on the Tory benches in the face of a potential clampdown on Hong Kong by the Chinese government. The advice says ministers are wrong to suggest they are bound by agreements with China to refuse a right of abode to the tens of thousands of Hong Kong citizens who hold a British national (overseas), or BN(O), passport. Home Office ministers have been resisting a claim to a legal right of abode on the basis it might be in breach of the understandings the UK government reached with China alongside the 1984 joint declaration on the future of Hong Kong. The issue has suddenly regained importance after the Chinese government said it intended to impose sweeping new security laws on Hong Kong that risk its semi-autonomous status. The offer of a right of abode to BN(O) passport-holders is seen as one of the few practical steps that may be in the sole gift of the UK, the former colonial power of the city, to alleviate the plight of citizens fearing persecution by the Chinese state. A group of Tory MPs, led by Bob Seely and Imran Ahmad Khan, have seen the new legal advice and want at least a clear government statement that no legal obstacle exists to an offer of a right of abode, and any refusal to make that offer is purely a political or diplomatic choice. BN(O) passport-holders have the right to visit for up to six months, but cannot automatically work in the UK or gain citizenship. Seely said: “It would be a stain on our country’s reputation if other nations were to open their arms, metaphorically speaking, to Hong Kong BN(O) folk in their hour of need before the UK did so.” Ministers have frequently said, most recently last year, that an offer of right of abode would be in breach of the commitments made by the British and Chinese governments in memorandums attached to the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration on the future of Hong Kong. Those memorandums established BN(O) in Hong Kong as a new class of British citizens that could only be claimed by those born before the handover. But in a new opinion, Laurie Fransman, the leading QC on nationality law, writes: “Domestic British nationality law has evolved since the 1984 declaration including by giving greater extension of the right of abode to ‘British nationals’, including BN(O)s, in compliance with the expectations of international law.” British citizens, including some BN(O)s, were given a right to register, he points out, adding: “Manifestly, the UK government did not consider itself barred by the memoranda, or anything else, from taking such action.” He says he endorses those who claim BN(O)s can be given a right of abode. In making their legal case, ministers also frequently cite a report on citizenship written for the then Labour government by the former attorney general Lord Goldsmith in 2008. Goldsmith has himself written to the home secretary, Priti Patel, to ask the government to stop using him in aid of their argument. In his letter he insists he had not in 2008 himself passed any judgment on whether a right of abode from BN(O)s would be in breach of the joint declaration, adding his position had been mischaracterised by the government. He wrote that his report had merely cited, but not endorsed, the contemporary view of the Foreign Office that it may be in breach. His own subsequent independent examination of this issue, he said in his letter sent in February, found that the joint declaration was no obstacle. Goldsmith pointed out, in a view endorsed by Fransman, that the status of the BN(O)s is not mentioned in the joint declaration but in a memorandum of understanding sent by the British government on the same day. The memorandum was received by the Chinese government, but never signed or agreed. The memorandum excludes a right of abode, Goldsmith concedes, but he claims it did not bind the future domestic actions of the UK government in perpetuity. Armed with the new legal arguments, Seely and Ahmad Khan have now written to Patel, saying : “Given the deteriorating situation in Hong Kong, with the continued erosion of the rule of law, it strikes us that the government could consider reviewing its position on BN(O) passports. “BN(O) passports were always a compromise, dependent in part on the rights guaranteed in the handover settlement. The introduction of the national security legislation means that that settlement is essentially dead. As such there are clear legal and practical grounds for looking again at this matter.”"
2020-05-24T13:20:27Z,politics,Politics,How Dominic Cummings became indispensable to Boris Johnson,"In Downing Street on Brexit night, 31 January this year, while Boris Johnson sounded a gong and quaffed Chateau Margaux, Dominic Cummings reportedly wept. For Johnson, getting Brexit done was part and parcel of achieving his long-held ambition to be prime minister (the next best thing to “world king”, as the young Johnson once put it). But for Cummings, breaching the union with the EU 27 fulfilled a long-held conviction – and, he hoped, opened up a once-in-a-generation opportunity of radical political reform. The two men are very different. Johnson courts approval; Cummings disdains it. Yet the prime minister, 55, has come to rely heavily on the 48-year-old Cummings, whom he first witnessed on the political frontline during the EU referendum campaign. Indeed, there could be no stronger indication of Johnson’s fealty to his adviser than the fact he chose to throw a protective ring of cabinet ministers around him this weekend rather than demand his resignation. For much of the tight-knit team around Johnson, that referendum summer of 2016 was the defining moment of their lives – a David and Goliath struggle in which they pitched themselves against the might of a lavishly-funded remain campaign. As Paul Stephenson, Vote Leave’s director of communications, who was present at the Downing Street party, tweeted the next day: “Total outsiders in a shell of an office took on the entire establishment and won … and now the gang are making history.”
The result vindicated the team’s sense that they understood the concerns of rank-and-file British voters better than many slicker communicators – David Cameron, George Osborne – who believed themselves to be masters of the art of politics. Indeed, in temperament and mindset, the Vote Leavers had much in common with Jeremy Corbyn’s cadre of aides, as they took on Theresa May’s government 12 months later. There was an us-against-the-world sense of camaraderie, an appetite for taking risks and an almost gleeful contempt for the political consensus of the past 40 years – including the tribal party loyalties that usually demarcate Westminster politics. Eton and Oxford-educated Johnson was the Conservative mayor of London when he stepped down to join his fortunes with Vote Leave; Cummings too is an Oxford graduate, and his father-in-law owns a castle – but both believed themselves to be outside the “political elite”. And after their victory in 2016, the Vote Leavers defined themselves and others by which side they had stood on in that torrid summer, and how hard they had fought. Cummings, whose contempt for MPs is legendary, retreated to the sidelines for much of the ensuing three years, as the details of the withdrawal agreement were worked out in negotiations, and then torn to pieces again by the Tory party. But after May resigned a year ago and Johnson took over, Cummings’ appointment was one of the first he made – and sent a clear signal that his would be a Vote Leave government. With Brexit still hanging in the balance, Johnson valued Cummings’ absolute commitment to the cause. But with no majority and a deeply divided party, he also knew he would need to fight a general election in short order – and Cummings is the consummate campaigner. For Cummings, the call to Johnson’s side in Downing Street last July was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Not just to “get Brexit done”, the ringing election slogan that party legend says was first uttered by a participant in one of his beloved focus groups, but to pursue his other intellectual preoccupation – reshaping the British state. So total was Cummings’ commitment that he postponed elective surgery in order to take the job. The 2019 election manifesto was peppered with his obsessions, from ensuring government made better use of data science to rebalancing the economy away from London and shaking up “the broader aspects of our constitution” after Brexit. Other aspects of the programme, including ditching austerity, reflected long-held preoccupations of the prime minister. But it is unclear even to close colleagues what a Johnson prospectus, shorn of Cummings’ influence, would have looked like. So perhaps it is not surprising that, despite musing at last year’s Tory conference that he might not return after the general election campaign, Cummings was back at No 10 in January, seeking applications from “weirdos and misfits with odd skills” to work with him in remaking Whitehall. With a comfortable majority, there was an opportunity to pursue some of his preoccupations – including boosting state investment in science and shaking up government departments. Johnson has not always gone along with Cummings’ wilder schemes: many of the most radical plans for overhauling Whitehall were ditched in place of modest tweaks, for example. But Cummings is ever-present, and his ability to slice through the complexities of day-by-day challenges is highly prized by Johnson, who is not known for his attention to detail. And just as for Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, who served May before being ousted after the 2017 election, and indeed for Corbyn’s chief aide, Seumas Milne, too, the boss’s confidence brings with it immense power. One former cabinet minister described Cummings’ attention sweeping across their department like the Eye of Sauron, in The Lord of the Rings. When Boris Johnson carried out a ruthless reshuffle three months ago, it was an open secret that Sajid Javid, the chancellor, resigned more because he had fallen out with Cummings than over any beef with the prime minister. Javid was told he must sack his aides and instead employ a team hand-picked by Johnson (for which, read Cummings). Instead, he chose to resign. It was such an open secret, in fact, that he subsequently joked in his resignation speech about “Cummings and goings” at the heart of government. More recently, it was Cummings who sat on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) as the prime minister’s eyes and ears (and sometimes, it appears, mouthpiece). And insiders say it was Cummings, above all, who persuaded the laissez-faire, anti-nanny state prime minister to go for an all-out lockdown – not least because his focus groups were telling him the public wanted clear instructions. That now looks ironic, to say the least. • This article was amended on 27 May 2020. An earlier version said Boris Johnson had “resigned” as mayor of London."
2020-05-24T13:15:17Z,politics,Politics,Catching the travel bug: Cummings' take on virus puts Grant in hot seat | John Crace,"“Stay at home. Protect the NHS. Drive 250 miles to Durham. Pretend you’re still in London. Visit local beauty spot on Easter Day. Travel back to London. Travel back to Durham. Stay at home. Protect the prime minister. Protect his senior adviser.” Somehow the government’s lockdown slogans have got a lot less catchy over the past 36 hours. How much must Boris Johnson hate Grant Shapps? If it was a punishment beating to send Grant out to do the Downing Street press conference on Saturday, it was waterboarding to ask him to do the Sunday morning media round after, overnight, further allegations about Dominic Cummings’s cavalier approach to lockdown – Classic Dom had morphed into Classic Classic Dom – were broken by the Guardian, Observer and Daily Mirror. At best, the transport secretary could claim he had a little more expertise in his departmental brief, having been involved in three car wrecks within a day. The question on most people’s lips by the end of the morning was whether Shapps was being deliberately stupid or whether it came naturally to him. The more philosophically minded were also wondering if the two were mutually exclusive. As usual when there is a crisis in government, Boris was nowhere to be seen. His cowardice is rapidly becoming an even greater problem to him than his laziness, incompetence and lack of morality. The prime minister is paralysed with fear. Keep his senior adviser and lose the trust of the entire country and rapidly growing numbers of his own MPs. Or sack Dom and revert to his natural state as a directionless, clueless, ball of ambition laced with need. The further complication is that Boris doesn’t even know if he can sack Dom, as it’s Dom who is effectively running the show. So it was left to the hapless Shapps to defend the indefensible. First on Sky’s Ridge on Sunday and then on the BBC’s Marr Show. “Can we talk about the dualling of the A66,” Grant pleaded, somehow hoping the subject of Classic Classic Dom wouldn’t come up. ‘Er, no,” Sophy Ridge insisted. Was he still standing by the line taken by most members of the cabinet that it had been perfectly OK for Cummings to have taken his family on a moonlight flit at a time when he himself had no symptoms of the coronavirus and the official government guidelines were for people to stay where they were and put themselves in self isolation? “Oh yes,” said Shapps confidently. The government had always been very clear that no one should really pay any attention to the lockdown regulations. They had really just been a series of vague suggestions and he couldn’t understand why almost everyone had been so supine as to slavishly follow them in an effort not to spread the virus. In any case, it wasn’t as if we were talking about some chav or single mother here: Dom’s parents had their own private estate with a separate outhouse so everything was totally above board. It was all downhill from there. Even though Ridge pointed out that she had broken the habit of a lifetime in giving Shapps advance notice of the questions so he couldn’t say he didn’t know any of the answers, it still turned out that the transport secretary didn’t know anything. In fact he had gone out of his way to know nothing. He couldn’t say if Cummings had stopped for petrol or a pee on the 250-mile journey up north. He couldn’t say if Boris knew Dom was in Durham. He couldn’t say if Cummings had broken the 14-day isolation rule to go to Barnard Castle, though he could quite understand if he had because the town was a wonderful tourist attraction. “Cummings is a stickler for keeping to the rules,” Shapps said. A career-ending moment on live TV as Dom would be spitting blood to hear that. Grant would be toast. Cummings’s whole persona has been based on his being a rule-breaker, the disruptor dedicated to breaking up cosy elites. Now here he was being firmly portrayed as a fully paid-up member of the establishment. Moreover, one who was deemed so important to government that the rules that applied to the little people didn’t apply to him. Shapps begged for more time to be allowed to talk about the A66. “It really is very important,” he said. Hell, if it helped he could even talk about a new cycle path in St Albans due to open in 2023. Or a new ferry service across the Ouse. But Ridge was having none of it. She went for Shapps forensically, and time and again all he could do was smile vacantly, just playing for time knowing that at some point his ordeal would come to an end. Except it was only just starting as Andrew Marr would be covering much the same ground little more than half an hour later. If anything the outing on Sky had only left Shapps more traumatised rather than better prepared as he became more and more sweaty and less and less coherent during the course of the interview. A low bar admittedly. The Durham police were basically a bunch of liars who had been caught out telling the truth. And even if Dom had been to Barnard Castle he definitely hadn’t gone walking in a bluebell wood on a second visit to the north-east in April, because he had been assured Dom hated bluebells as they were the epitome of bourgeois remainer flowers. So if he and his family had been seen, it must have been one of the many teams of body doubles that have plagued the Cummings family for years now. In any case, even though he definitely hadn’t talked to Dom or Boris over the past day, he knew for a fact that Dom hadn’t done any of this because they had told him so directly. And if there was one thing Cummings and Boris could be relied on for it was their advocacy of the truth. “Please can we talk about the A66?” Shapps sobbed again. It would save so many lives during the pandemic on the route between Penrith and Scotch Corner. Marr looked at him with something approaching pity. The transport secretary was just collateral damage in a battle No 10 was sure to lose anyway. There was no way for the government to retain credibility with Cummings still in post. As it was, the cabinet had as good as admitted that everyone was free to interpret the lockdown however they saw fit. But on the plus side we had all learned more about the A66."
2020-05-24T13:12:14Z,politics,Politics,Did Dominic Cummings break the law on lockdown rules?,"On 23 March, the prime minister announced a nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus. “I must give the British people a very simple instruction – you must stay at home,” said Boris Johnson. Dominic Cummings certainly ignored that diktat, along with government guidance not to travel anywhere else to self-isolate. But did he break the law? On 26 March, regulations were introduced in England that made it an offence to leave home without a “reasonable excuse” and to gather in groups of more than two. The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020 gave police powers to forcibly return those who refused to comply with the lockdown to their homes and issue fines to dissenters. We know Cummings went to Durham after the regulations came into force. He was seen running away from Downing Street on 27 March and was definitely in Durham by 31 March, when officers from the local police force spoke to his father. Downing Street has not contradicted a witness who told the Guardian they also saw Cummings in Barnard Castle, 30 miles from Durham, on 12 April. Whether he contravened the regulations depends on the definition of “reasonable excuse”. The regulations do not define the term but they do provide non-exhaustive lists of reasonable excuses to be outside, such as shopping for necessities, doing exercise and travelling to and from work. Even when Boris Johnson announced a slight relaxation of lockdown in England on 11 May – when he said “you can drive as far as you like to reach an outdoor space” – that was specifically only for the purpose of exercise. Asked by reporters on Saturday for her reading of “reasonable excuse”, the deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, suggested “extreme risk to life” would fit the bill. “If you’re symptomatic, you stay at home, take yourself out of society as quickly as you can and stay there, unless there’s extreme risk to life,” she said at the daily press conference. Downing Street’s statement says Cummings travelled 260 miles north “owing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell. It was essential … to ensure his young child could be properly cared for.” The regulations are clear that had Cummings been stopped by police en route to Durham, officers could have directed him to return to London and fined him. The wording of the regulations says police only need to “consider” (ie believe) that someone had left home without a reasonable excuse in order to send them back. The government had already issued non-legally-binding guidance that said people should not leave home to isolate elsewhere: “Essential travel does not include visits to second homes, campsites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays. People must remain in their primary residence. Not taking these steps puts additional pressure on communities and services that are already at risk.” Theoretically, police could also have sent Cummings back to London using another new law, the Coronavirus Act 2020, which gave police further powers to remove a potentially infectious person for screening/assessment and also to detain them if they refuse to comply. But whether the police can retrospectively fine someone considered to have broken the rules is unclear."
2020-05-23T20:46:19Z,politics,Politics,Cummings and cabinet cheerleaders feel heat from social media fury,"A huge outpouring of anger, frustration and sadness appeared across social media on Saturday after government ministers sought to defend Dominic Cummings’s breach of lockdown rules. The prime minister’s senior adviser drove his family 260 miles from their home while infected with coronavirus, apparently to seek the support of his relatives. As cabinet ministers claimed that this showed Cummings’s compassion, many people who have been forced to endure hardship and tragedy while separated from family during lockdown shared their feelings in response. After the health secretary, Matt Hancock, tweeted that it was “entirely right” for Cummings to drive from London to his parents’ house in Durham, Jenny Dee, the director of the Chipping Norton literary festival, wrote in response: “My mum and I accepted that we couldn’t have a funeral for my dad, we accepted that at 86 and newly widowed she must spend months alone – we followed your rules, we were entirely right. Cummings’s actions and your defence of them is entirely wrong.” A nurse, David Munday, also addressed Hancock when he spoke of his own challenges isolating with the illness. “When I got it Matt, my wife and three children (9, 5 and 3) quarantined. We didn’t go out. When I went to hospital because of having #Covid-19, my wife continued to quarantine with the kids. Should we have ignored your Govt rules?” The minister for the Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, tweeted a message in support of Cummings which read: “Caring for your wife and child is not a crime.”
It received 20,000 replies, one from Helen Goodman, the former Labour MP for Bishop Auckland. “Michael, I cared for my dad,” she wrote, “but I wasn’t allowed to see him before he died in a Durham care home.” The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, tweeted: “Taking care of your wife and young child is justifiable and reasonable, trying to score political points over it isn’t.” Underneath there was a reply from Lesley Hogg of Dunfermline. “Meanwhile in the real world,” she wrote, “I wasn’t officially permitted to be with my dying father as I didn’t live in the same household, my mum was meant to cope with this alone and there could only be 10 (socially distanced) mourners at his funeral. My heart will never, ever mend.”
Many other Twitter users referenced the death of Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab from Brixton. The 13-year-old died in King’s College hospital after testing positive for coronavirus. His family were not allowed to visit him and were also unable to attend his funeral because of self-isolation rules. A Twitter user called Michelle wrote of the Cummings episode: “This is so wrong on so many levels & the support he’s getting is disgusting! Have they forgotten Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab who was laid to rest without his family because of these rules that everyone else has to follow?”"
2020-05-23T20:00:02Z,politics,Politics,MPs in growing revolt over plan for 2 June Commons return,"Boris Johnson is facing a growing revolt by MPs of all parties this weekend against plans to force them back to Westminster on 2 June and vote in person in the House of Commons. More than 70 MPs, including most chairs of select committees, have signed a letter complaining that the plans to ditch all remote voting – announced by the Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg – would also lead to queues of more than 650 MPs stretching for over a kilometre around the Palace of Westminster. They say that MPs who are shielding will be unable to vote and will therefore be excluded from the democratic process. The rebel MPs have won support from the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, who has written to colleagues saying that he would prefer to retain the system of hybrid voting, in which MPs can choose whether they vote in person or remotely, and hopes that the government can be persuaded to change its mind. Another concern being raised by MPs who live far from London is that they will have to move back to second homes they share with other MPs, breaking lockdown rules. In the protest letter, written and co-ordinated by the chairman of the standards and privileges committee, Chris Bryant, to the chair of the procedure committee, Karen Bradley, the group of Labour, Tory, Liberal Democrat, SNP and Plaid Cymru MPs state: “Voting must not increase the risk of infection. Yet if members are to queue at two metres’ distance, they will be passing in the slipstream of hundreds of colleagues in a queue that will extend for 1,300 metres, throughout most of the parliamentary estate. “All members should be treated equally and should have an equal right to participate and represent their constituents in both debates and divisions. Yet many members are shielding or have partners and family members who are shielding, or have childcare responsibilities, which would make it irresponsible for them to vote in person. Pairing means they are not participating and their constituents’ voice is not heard or recorded.” Tory MP and GP Dr Dan Poulter said: “I think it’s crazy. There are a large number of MPs in high-risk categories – the obese, those over 70 or those with serious underlying health conditions – who will have to choose to either put themselves at risk or not participate in parliament, which is not acceptable nor sustainable for them or for their constituents. It is probably through being squashed on to the green benches in parliament that both the PM and [the health secretary] became infected in the first place. MPs should be setting an example on the importance of social distancing and shielding vulnerable colleagues.” Labour MP Stella Creasy said that the proposals were unworkable and would harm democracy. “There are MPs shielding as they have longterm health conditions or their family members do, others won’t be able to get childcare and the new restrictions mean we risk a two-tier parliament where only the chosen get heard.” In an article for the Observer Bryant writes: “I would gently suggest to traditionalists in the Conservative ranks that this will bring the whole system into such disrepute that by the summer everyone will be clamouring for electronic voting to become permanent.” On 20 May Rees-Mogg announced the plan for MPs to return on 2 June, arguing that it would allow the government to pass badly needed legislation. He said that hybrid parliamentary proceedings – which involve most MPs contributing via video-link – did not allow sufficient scrutiny of policy matters. Government sources say that it will be far more difficult for the government to push for schools to reopen partially on 1 June if parliament is not prepared to set an example and return to something close to normality at the same time."
2020-05-23T18:30:00Z,politics,Politics,"In private, Tories were dismayed. In public, they rallied to save Dominic Cummings","It was Mother’s Day – 22 March – and as Covid-19 spread across the country, Boris Johnson was urging families not to mark the occasion as normal. “This Mothering Sunday,” he said, “the single best present we can give – we who owe our mothers so much – is to spare them the risk of catching a dangerous disease. The sad news is that that means staying away. This time the best thing is to ring her, video-call her or Skype her – but avoid any unnecessary physical contact or proximity.” The following day Johnson imposed a full lockdown on the country. Pubs and restaurants had to close. Johnson banned all but essential travel. The message was crystal clear, and was repeated day after day by government ministers. It was to stay at home wherever possible, however painful and difficult doing so might seem. For weeks beforehand, those suffering symptoms of coronavirus had been ordered to self-isolate, as had anyone with whom they had come into contact. The police had been given powers to impose fines on those flouting the rules. Adults up and down the country stayed away from their parents and grandparents, however old and vulnerable they were. Lockdown was a national sacrifice that had to be made – by everyone. Yet some time the following weekend – 28/29 March – Johnson’s closest adviser Dominic Cummings, his wife Mary Wakefield, a journalist who was already suffering from Covid-19 symptoms, and their young child, drove more than 250 miles from their London home to the farm where Cummings’s parents live near Durham. Over that weekend Cummings also developed symptoms and became very ill.
Without revealing their location and that they had ever left London, Wakefield would later give an account of her husband’s Covid-19 experience in an article for the Spectator. “Dom couldn’t get out of bed. Day in, day out for 10 days he lay doggo with a high fever and spasms.” Cummings wrote of his illness too saying: “At the end of March and for the first two weeks of April I was ill, so we were both shut in together.” Wakefield recalled that when they had both shaken off the virus “we emerged from quarantine into the almost comical uncertainty of London lockdown” – a statement her readers could have been forgiven for thinking meant they had never left the capital at all. Late on Friday evening, however, people learned otherwise when the Guardian and Daily Mirror jointly broke the story of the Cummings family’s trip north at the height of the lockdown. Durham police said they were made aware that Cummings had travelled from London and was in the area on 31 March. In a statement last night they said: “At the request of Mr Cummings’s father, an officer made contact the following morning by telephone. “During that conversation, Mr Cummings’s father confirmed that his son had travelled with his family from London to the North-East and was self-isolating in part of the property. “Durham Constabulary deemed that no further action was required. However, the officer did provide advice in relation to security issues.” A neighbour told the papers of the sighting. “I got the shock of my life, as I looked over to the gates and saw him. I recognised Dominic Cummings – he’s a very distinctive figure.” Similar examples of public officials flouting lockdown guidelines have led to swift resignations with senior Conservatives leading choruses of condemnation. When Professor Neil Ferguson, the leading epidemiologist, quit as a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) after admitting he had been visited by his girlfriend, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was “speechless” and made much of his willingness to help the police with any inquiries they might make. But this time if Conservative ministers, MPs and No 10 staff were shocked they tried their damnedest not to show it. They took time marshalling defensive lines to save the most powerful and feared man in Whitehall, after Johnson himself. For 14 hours after the revelations caused a storm on social media the government machine seemed stunned into silence. Only a few “friends” of Cummings tried to fight back with anonymous comments. Cummings himself can normally spin his way quickly out of the tightest of corners but even he was slow to react.
By mid-morning on Saturday, however, as calls grew from opposition MPs for him to quit, No 10 began its fightback. No, he would not resign under any circumstances. In fact the message was more that what Cummings had done deserved respect, and was well within the rules. Officials highlighted a part of government lockdown advice which said people could leave home in exceptional circumstances including to “provide care or help for a vulnerable person” – while failing to mention all the other parts which suggested they should have stayed put with their child. The evolving defensive argument was that Cummings’s child had needed to be cared for as the parents were suffering or about to suffer from Covid-19. With Labour demanding an urgent statement and clarity, the cabinet suddenly began to sing with one voice and rallied round Johnson’s man. Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove, who used to employ Cummings and defends him at every turn, spoke out suggesting those who questioned the controversial adviser were the unthoughtful ones: “Caring for your wife and child is not a crime,” he said. Fellow senior cabinet colleagues, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, also weighed in in harmony. “Taking care of your wife and young child is justifiable and reasonable, trying to score political points over it isn’t,” Sunak tweeted. The script was now decided and No 10 issued a statement saying: “Owing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for. “His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed. “His sister shopped for the family and left everything outside. “At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter, as is being reported. “His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines. Mr Cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally.” But privately many Tory MPs and ministers were dismayed. The police, while cautious in public, were in private clearly furious. Scientists were incredulous and civil servants confided fears that Cummings was completely out of control. One senior mandarin said the cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill should investigate whether Cummings had breached the civil service code by so clearly going against the spirit of government policy, at a time of and on a matter of, national emergency. “Someone should be asking if Cummings’s behaviour was consistent with the civil service code, and if not what are they going to do about it?” said the civil servant.
Durham’s acting police and crime commissioner, Steve White, whose force’s account of events was being challenged by No 10, said: “Given the whole ethos of the guidance and regulations issued from the government was to reduce the spread, regardless of reason, by travelling to County Durham when known to be infected was most unwise.” University College London professor Susan Michie, a member of Sage, told Sky News there was no question that what Cummings had done broke the guidance. “It appears that three rules have been broken. One is leaving the house when you’re symptomatic, another is travelling far distances and staying overnight elsewhere, and the third is having a person – in this case a child – go from one household to another household. The problem about having different rules for different people is that it breaks the trust of the people in those who are issuing the guidelines.” Dean Burnett of Cardiff University took a similar view. “What Dominic Cummings did was utterly reckless. He knew he could have been infected with Covid-19, yet he drove more than 200 miles to his parents’ house. They are in their 70s, the most vulnerable group. It is utterly bewildering. “This is a man who is on the Sage committee and who is influencing government policy on Covid-19 and he behaves like this. It is unacceptable. He should resign.” Burnett added that his own father had died of Covid-19 but he had still respected the rules of lockdown. “I could not comfort my father as he died and have had to grieve for him on my own. Like the rest of my family, I respected the rules of lockdown. Yet the man who has had key influence in setting up those rules seems to be quite happy to ignore them when it suits him. It is infuriating.”
In an attempt to turn the heat on to Johnson himself Labour also demanded to know who in Downing Street had known about Cummings’s progress to the north, after officials said several people in No 10 had been aware he had left London, though none had said so before yesterday. Last night as new claims emerged in the Observer about further sightings of Cummings in different locations near Durham, it is clear the prime minister and Tory ministers are united in trying to defend him and keep him in post come what may. But while it would be a humiliation and a severe embarrassment for Johnson to lose Cummings, there are big dangers in keeping him too. This weekend the police are trying to manage expected bank holiday crowds at a time when many people already believe the lockdown is effectively over. They are in danger of losing the battle as their authority has been undermined. Asked whether Cummings’s actions would make the work of officers harder, Dorset crime commissioner Martyn Underhill said: “I’m sure inevitably it will be today, because this is a breaking story and he is a very high-profile person. It is very unfortunate the timing of this, because this is going to be the busiest weekend Dorset’s seen this year in a policing sense and a tourist sense.”
More broadly there is a prospect that the whole episode will erode trust in the government, which is already on the slide, and lead people simply to ignore rules they see being flouted or bent by those at the top. In the latest Opinium poll for the Observer this weekend, the political dangers for Boris Johnson are clear. For the first time since the Covid-19 crisis began Labour leader Keir Starmer has a higher approval rating than the prime minister for his handling of the pandemic. Some 47% of people approve of Starmer’s leadership against 45% who back Johnson’s. The government’s net approval rating (when the percentage that disapprove is subtracted from the percentage that approves) has fallen from +42% on 26 March to -4% now. The government has opted to try to stand by Cummings. But as it faces the increasingly difficult challenge of attempting to ease the lockdown with more nuanced and complex messages, it will need the public’s support to do so. Nick Baines, the bishop of Leeds, told the Observer that if there was seen to be one rule for those in power and another for the rest then the trust on which leadership depends would be lost. “People across the country have sacrificed hugely in order to obey both the spirit and word of government advice. People have missed being with family members who have died,” he said. “But now we learn that there is one rule for the people and another for No 10 and the elite. Ministers have clearly been told to tweet support for Cummings. What price conscience? Or integrity? Or credibility? Or competence at a time when leadership can only be rooted in trust?” In a crisis such as the one the country is currently enduring, the last thing any government wants is to no longer be believed by the people it represents."
2020-05-23T18:30:00Z,politics,Politics,New witnesses cast doubt on Dominic Cummingsâ€™s lockdown claims,"Devastating new claims have emerged that Dominic Cummings further breached the lockdown rules, as Downing Street came under sustained pressure to fire the prime minister’s most senior adviser. The new testimony suggests Cummings left the home where he was staying in Durham to visit a town 30 miles away on 12 April.
He was allegedly spotted back in Durham on 19 April, days after he was photographed in London having recovered from the virus, suggesting that following his first trip across the country at the end of March he had made a second journey from the capital to north-east England. At the time, with the UK at the peak of the pandemic, the government was insisting that people should be staying at home. As Cummings faced calls to resign from across the political spectrum, the government was forced to defend his actions. Ministers insisted he had stayed put once arriving at a property in Durham, where he had travelled after contracting the symptoms of coronavirus to seek the support from his extended family. But the new claims would appear to demolish this defence and intensify questions over his claim that going there was permitted because he needed childcare while he was sick. The new accounts raise fresh questions about his insistence that the initial 264-mile trip to Durham was justified, and led to a new round of calls for the spin doctor to quit.
The two new witnesses were revealed in a joint investigation by the Guardian/Observer and the Sunday Mirror. One saw him in Durham on 19 April, days after Cummings was photographed in London having recovered from the virus. A week earlier Cummings was seen by another witness in Barnard Castle on Easter Day, 30 miles away from Durham, the investigation found. The town, which takes its name from the English Heritage site at its centre, is a popular destination for days out. Robin Lees, 70, a retired chemistry teacher from the town, says he saw Cummings and his family walking by the Tees before getting into a car around lunchtime on 12 April. Lees said: “I was a bit gobsmacked to see him, because I know what he looks like. And the rest of the family seemed to match – a wife and child. I was pretty convinced it was him and it didn’t seem right because I assumed he would be in London.” He added: “I went home and told my wife, we thought he must be in London. I searched up the number plate later that day and my computer search history shows that.” Asked if he thought Cummings should resign, Lees said: “Of course he should. [Catherine] Calderwood [Scotland’s former chief medical officer] resigned after being stupid by visiting her second home. [Government scientific adviser Prof Neil] Ferguson didn’t even go anywhere, it was his mistress, and he had to resign too. “They didn’t do anything nearly as irresponsible as Cummings. You don’t take the virus from one part of the country to another. It just beggars belief to think you could actually drive when the advice was stay home, save lives. It couldn’t have been clearer.” When Cummings was apparently recognised a second time on 19 April, he was wearing his trademark beanie hat, and was heard commenting on how “lovely” the bluebells were during an early morning Sunday stroll with his wife Mary Wakefield. The second eyewitness, who declined to be named, said: “We were shocked and surprised to see him because the last time we did was earlier in the week in Downing Street.” Cummings had been photographed on 14 April in Downing Street, the first time he had been seen back at work since recovering from the virus. “We thought: ‘He’s not supposed to be here during the lockdown,’” the source said. “We thought: ‘What double standards, one rule for him as a senior adviser to the prime minister and another for the rest of us.’” At Saturday’s daily Downing Street press conference, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said Cummings’s actions, first revealed by the Guardian and Daily Mirror, were acceptable because he and his family had remained in isolation after arriving at the property in Durham, rather than travelling away from the property. “The decision here was to go to that location and stay in that location,” he said. “They didn’t then move around from there.” The deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, said the aim of the advice on self-isolation was to remain “out of circulation”. Shapps said that the prime minister gave Cummings his full support. He added that he did not know when Boris Johnson became aware of the circumstances of Cummings’s decision to go to Durham. Asked whether Cummings’s claim that the police had not spoken to his family, despite an official statement to the contrary, meant that Durham constabulary were lying, he said that he was “not sure where the confusion in that comes in”. Durham police are standing by their statement issued on Friday that the Cummings family was reminded of the lockdown rules on 31 March, after he was seen in the area. After Downing Street contradicted the official police statement and said that “at no stage was [Cummings] or his family spoken to by the police”, Durham police provided details of a conversation with Cummings’s father, saying that “at the request of Mr Cummings’s father, an officer made contact” and that Cummings’s father confirmed his son had travelled to the property. Downing Street has also been accused of a cover-up after initial reports that some in No 10 knew Cummings had made the journey. Labour, the Scottish National party and the Liberal Democrats have written to the head of the civil service, Sir Mark Sedwill, demanding an inquiry into what happened. The latest claims led to fresh calls on Saturday night for Cummings to resign. The SNP’s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, called on the cabinet secretary to investigate the “rule-breaking and the Tory government’s cover-up” of Cummings’s journey to Durham. Acting Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: “If Dominic Cummings is now allowed to remain in place a moment longer, it will increasingly be the prime minister’s judgment that is in the spotlight.” Meanwhile, the cabinet’s most senior ministers were accused of placing political loyalty over public health, after they launched an orchestrated battle to defend Cummings. Michael Gove, Matt Hancock, Dominic Raab and Rishi Sunak were among those to defend the spin doctor. A Labour source, commenting to the PA Media news agency about the new allegations, said: “If these latest revelations are true, why on earth were cabinet ministers sent out this [Saturday] afternoon to defend Dominic Cummings? “We need an urgent investigation by the cabinet secretary to get to the bottom of this matter. It cannot be right that there is one rule for the prime minister’s adviser and another for the British people.” Police warned that the allegations came at a crucial moment in the lockdown, with officers attempting to enforce the rules during a sunny bank holiday. George Peretz QC, a public law barrister, also suggested Cummings could have breached laws put in place to enforce the lockdown. Downing Street declined to comment on the new claims before publication. On Saturday night, after initial online publication, it issued this statement: “Yesterday [Friday] the Mirror and Guardian wrote inaccurate stories about Mr Cummings. Today [Saturday] they are writing more inaccurate stories including claims that Mr Cummings returned to Durham after returning to work in Downing Street on 14 April. We will not waste our time answering a stream of false allegations about Mr Cummings from campaigning newspapers.”"
2020-05-23T17:12:09Z,politics,Politics,Independent Group for Change's financial records were destroyed,"Staff at the Independent Group for Change, the disbanded party established by centrist MPs in 2019, “inappropriately destroyed” financial records, a report by its auditors has found. According to the auditors, documents including bank statements and files recording details of donations to the party were destroyed by former members of staff. None of the documents, auditors said, could be “satisfactorily reconstructed”. The report, contained in accounts filed at Companies House on Friday, said the loss of the documents had limited the scope of the auditor’s review of the party’s finances.
Neil Davidson, the party’s treasurer, disputed aspects of the auditor’s characterisation of the party’s record keeping and insisted there was no impropriety in the destruction of documents. He told the Guardian the party has “absolutely nothing to hide”. Davidson, a prominent businessman and partner of the party’s leader, Anna Soubry, said the party retained “a full list of donors” and had been “fully compliant” with the Electoral Commission’s rules on vetting and recording donations. The Independent Group for Change, established as a limited company by Labour MPs in 2019, is being wound up after a turbulent year that concluded with the loss of all its remaining MPs at the general election in December. Accounts show the party received £1.6m in donations during its brief existence. The majority of the donations fell below the reportable threshold of £7,500, meaning the party was not required to disclose the donations to the Electoral Commission. The party, which underwent multiple changes to its name and logo throughout 2019, spent £780,000, almost half of its money, on campaign advertising, according to the accounts. The party’s auditors, Cox Costello & Horne, signed off on the accounts earlier this month with a qualified opinion, an option available to auditors when they are unable to obtain sufficient audit evidence. The auditors said nothing had come to their attention that suggested there were any “material errors in the financial statements”. However, as a result of the destruction of documents, the auditors were “unable to determine” whether any adjustments to financial statements “might have been found to be necessary had the scope of our work not been limited”. According to the report, the documents were destroyed “during the winding down of operations”, but Davidson said this related to actions taken by former members of staff between June and July last year. Party staff, he said, “deleted certain email accounts which contained information on donors”. He said he believed they destroyed the information for data protection reasons. Asked about the loss of bank statements, Davidson said the party “was able to produce all the downloads of the transactions” to the auditors. The former Labour MP Mike Gapes, a co-director of the company, said he had “no knowledge” of the destruction of the documents. “Everything was done appropriately,” he added, “but it’s unfortunate that things could not be found.”"
2020-05-23T14:25:12Z,politics,Politics,"Dominic Cummings clearly broke rules, says ex-police chief","The former chief constable of Durham has said it is clear that Dominic Cummings broke the lockdown rules with his trip from London to the north-east. Mike Barton’s intervention comes as Downing Street faced accusations of a cover-up over the trip by the prime minister’s top aide to Durham at the height of the national lockdown, with reports that No 10 knew he had made the 264-mile journey after developing coronavirus symptoms. Opposition parties have called for Boris Johnson to sack his chief adviser over the apparent lockdown breach, which was revealed in an investigation by the Guardian and the Mirror. Durham constabulary said it had spoken to Cummings’s family to remind them of the lockdown rules after receiving reports on 31 March that he was in Durham days after becoming ill. Barton, who stood down as chief constable of Durham last year, said it was clear the prime minister’s top aide had broken the lockdown rules. He told the Guardian: “It’s obvious to anyone this breaks the rules. So it should be especially clear to the people who created them.” Durham police tried to avoid punishing people for lockdown breaches. It has been one of the forces to issue fewest fines, at about 137 between 27 March and 11 May, compared with North Yorkshire police’s 843. Barton said: “It sounds like Durham police have taken the sensible line of providing advice. One does not need to prosecute in every case.” The acting Durham police, crime and victims’ commissioner, Stephen White, said Cummings’s trip to Durham was unwise. “To beat this crisis we need to be selfless, as millions have been,” he said. “The response by the people of County Durham and Darlington has been exemplary, which makes this most frustrating and concerning.” Downing Street and Cummings have repeatedly refused to answer questions from the Guardian over a number of weeks about his movements, but Cummings broke his silence on Saturday when he addressed reporters outside his London home. He said he had “behaved reasonably and legally” in making the trip. Opposition MPs have accused No 10 of a cover-up and called for the prime minister’s top aide to resign. When a reporter suggested to Cummings outside his London home that the trip to Durham did not look good, he replied: “Who cares about good looks? “It’s a question of doing the right thing. It’s not about what you guys think. I behaved reasonably and legally.” Downing Street used similar language in a statement on Saturday. A spokesperson said: “Owing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for. His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed. “At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter. His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines. Mr Cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally.” Durham police said on Friday that officers had “explained to the family the [lockdown] guidelines”. On Saturday the force said it was standing by its statement and had nothing further to add. The BBC reported that an anonymous source close to Cummings had claimed that a “small number of people in No 10 knew that Cummings had gone to Durham”.
This prompted the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, to accuse Downing Street of trying to suppress the story. Blackford said: “What I find interesting … is that members of Downing Street knew about this, so first and foremost Boris Johnson has serious questions to answer over what now appears to be a cover-up.” Responding to No 10’s statement, a spokesperson for the Labour party said: “The lockdown rules were very clear. If you or anyone in your household was suspected of having Covid-19 you must immediately self-isolate and not leave the house. However, the prime minister’s chief adviser appears to believe that it is one rule for him and another for the British people. “This will cause understandable anger for the millions of people who have sacrificed so much during this crisis. “No 10’s statement also raises more questions than it answers. We are still unclear who knew about this decision and when, whether this was sanctioned by the prime minister and whether No 10 is now questioning the validity of the statement from Durham police. “At this afternoon’s press conference, we will be expecting answers to these questions.” The Guardian first approached Downing Street for a comment in April after being told by a neighbour of Cummings’s parents that they had seen him at the Durham property on 5 April. No 10 refused to discuss the issue at the time. A spokesman said: “It’ll be a no comment on that one. We wouldn’t get into location of individual members of staff.” Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Blackford said: “The prime minister must explain exactly when he knew about the breaking of the rules, whether he sanctioned it, why Cummings wasn’t sacked immediately and why it appears that he tried to cover it up, not telling the public until the newspaper[s] broke the story eight weeks later last night.” Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, the union that represents senior civil servants, said Johnson had a duty to explain Cummings’s behaviour. He told Today: “I think the prime minister needs to understand how heartbreaking this lockdown has been for so many families and the sacrifices that have been made up and down the country. “I think in these circumstances, if it looks like there is one rule for those at the centre of government and one rule for the rest of the country, then really the prime minister has a responsibility, as well as a constitutional responsibility, to explain his actions. He has known about this for six weeks.” Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats have also called for Cummings to resign or be sacked. One Tory MP said: “I won’t be lifting a finger to defend him.” They suggested Cummings would find few defenders in the parliamentary Conservative party. “He isn’t popular with most Tory MPs. The radio silence on the Tory MP WhatsApp group since the story broke is pretty telling. The issue is he’s increasingly becoming the story. The cardinal sin of any Spad [special adviser].” The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, accused opponents of Cummings of trying politicise his behaviour. He tweeted: “It’s reasonable and fair to ask for an explanation on this. And it has been provided: two parents with coronavirus were anxiously taking care of their young child. Those now seeking to politicise it should take a long hard look in the mirror.” His cabinet colleague Michael Gove tweeted: “Caring for your wife and child is not a crime.” Prof Susan Michie, of University College London, who is a member of Sage, the scientific group that has guided the government’s response to the coronavirus, suggested Cummings’s trip would undermine trust in the official advice on the outbreak.
Dorset’s police and crime commissioner, Martyn Underhill, said such a high-profile breach of the rules by Cummings would make it more difficult for police to enforce the lockdown. “Here’s a very high-profile person and it’s very unfortunate, the timing of this because, this is going to be the busiest weekend Dorset has seen this year,” he said."
2020-05-23T13:07:51Z,politics,Politics,UK firms to be asked to pay part of furloughed staff's wages from August,"Businesses will have to pay at least a fifth of the wages of furloughed employees from August, it has been reported. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is expected to announce next week that employers will have to begin contributing as the lockdown is eased further, according to the Times. Employers will be permitted to take furloughed workers back part-time, and all employers using the coronavirus job retention scheme will be required to make the payments, even if they remain closed, according to the paper. The Treasury said it was “not steering away” from the story, which is understood to have been briefed by officials, and it did not deny its accuracy. A Treasury source told the Times: “We’ve got two full months of support left and afterwards the government will help to pay people’s wages, but it’s fair to everyone that businesses contribute as they get back to work.” Sunak has said the furlough scheme will be in place until at least October. Companies are to be asked to start sharing the cost from the start of August, which could in effect force many employers to assess whether certain jobs remain viable. The Financial Times quoted a business leader this month as saying: “If the furlough scheme is paying for jobs that don’t really exist, it’s better to release people into the job market to start looking for other work.” The Treasury will reportedly direct employers to cover between 20% and 30% of an employee’s wage, and firms will also pay their national insurance contributions, which to about 5% of wages. The furlough scheme pays 80% of a worker’s salary up to £2,500 a month, and is supporting about 7.5m jobs, representing about a third of the private-sector workforce. The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the scheme could cost up to £80bn. The Treasury was criticised this month after an anonymous official briefed that the nation was becoming “addicted” to the programme. The scheme is set to be closed to new applicants before the changes, to reduce the risk of fraud. As of 12 May, HMRC had received 795 reports of potential concerns from the public suspecting employers could be abusing the scheme. Although these have not yet been corroborated, HMRC said it would pursue criminal action in serious cases. “It could be that you’re not being paid what you’re entitled to, they might be asking you to work while you’re on furlough, or they may have claimed for times when you were working,” an HMRC spokesperson said. “We’re not trying to catch people out. If it turns out to be a genuine mistake then we’ll help put it right, and if it’s more serious then we’ll step in.” Data released on Friday shows that retail sales dropped a record 18.1% in April as hundreds of thousands of businesses were forced to shut up shop to help tackle coronavirus."
2020-05-23T12:49:52Z,politics,Politics,Lockdown rule-breakers: what UK ministers said,"When members of the government have spoken publicly about breaches of lockdown, their message has been consistent: obey the rules. Since the UK was told to stay at home at the end of March, several high-profile figures have been caught breaking those rules. Before this weekend, the most prominent example of a lockdown rule-breaker was Prof Neil Ferguson. The Imperial College epidemiologist, whose modelling on coronavirus risks influenced the government, was found to have been visited at his home by his lover on at least two occasions. Ferguson resigned from his position as an adviser to the government on 6 May. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he had been left speechless by Ferguson’s behaviour. “Prof Ferguson is a very eminent and impressive scientist and the science that he has done has been an important part of what we’ve listened to,” Hancock told Sky News at the time. “I think he took the right decision to resign. I think the social distancing rules are very important and people should follow them.” Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, had a similar response: “Scientists like him have told us we should not be doing it, so surely in his case it is a case of we have been doing as he says and he has been doing as he wants to. “He has peculiarly breached his own guidelines and for an intelligent man I find that very hard to believe. It risks undermining the government’s lockdown message.” A month earlier, Dr Catherine Calderwood was forced to resign as Scotland’s chief medical officer after she was found to have repeatedly visited her second home on the coast of Fife. The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Jackson Carlaw, said it was right for her to have resigned. “There cannot be one rule for the bosses and another one for everyone else,” he said. A week after Calderwood’s resignation, the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, was revealed to have visited his parents’ home in Shropshire, 40 miles from his home in Herefordshire, while also continuing to work in London. Although there was little public support for him from fellow members of the government, Jenrick’s behaviour was cleared by the prime minister, whose spokesman said: “We’re confident that he complied with the social distancing rules.” There was some criticism of Jenrick from backbench Tory MPs, who anonymously called for his resignation in the Daily Mail. More off-the-record remarks were made in the Sunday Telegraph at the beginning of this month in support of tougher enforcement of lockdown rules by police. A senior government source told the paper: “Thanks to the enormous sacrifices of the British people, we have succeeded in protecting the NHS from being overwhelmed. “The vast majority of people have followed the rules but in the next phase of our fight it will be even more critical that a small minority of rule-breakers do not put the rest of us at risk. That is why we will give the police tougher powers to stamp down hard on rule-breakers.”"
2020-05-23T12:33:53Z,politics,Politics,Johnson's promised Brexit border in Irish Sea 'will not be ready in time',"A new Brexit border in the Irish Sea will not be ready by Boris Johnson’s end-of-year deadline, according to a new analysis that warns more than 60 administrations, government departments and public bodies will be involved in overseeing the new system. Ministers finally admitted last week that there would be some checks on certain goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK from next January, when the Brexit transition period comes to an end. Johnson and others have also refused to consider extending the transition period, despite having no agreement between the EU and Britain over the practical treatment of Northern Ireland and little prospect of a trade deal being in place by the start of 2021. However, in its most forthright intervention to date, the influential thinktank Institute for Government (IfG) said the transition period must be extended or a longer implementation period agreed for the new border arrangements in the Irish Sea. It warns that many businesses are simply focused on “staying afloat” during the coronavirus crisis and cannot be expected to concentrate on new trade arrangements – and suggests the government is underestimating the complexity of the new Northern Ireland arrangements. “The UK and the EU should extend the transition period or agree to a separate longer implementation period for the withdrawal agreement,” the institute warns in a new report. “The timetable for putting arrangements in place for the Irish Sea border was very tight even before Covid-19 hit Europe. But now coronavirus has slowed the pace of negotiations on the future relationship, delaying key decisions.
“Key businesses such as freight transport associations and trading associations are focused on maintaining supply chains rather than getting ready for new border arrangements, and many businesses are focusing on staying afloat, not complying with new regulatory requirements. Against the background of a global pandemic, it is very difficult to see how preparations to implement the protocol can be completed before the end of the year – given the scale of both the decisions and practical work still required.” New arrangements dealing with goods flowing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are needed as part of the so-called Northern Ireland protocol, hammered out by Johnson and the EU in January to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. A failure to implement it by the end of December would instead lead to the implementation of a very hard border in the Irish Sea. The IfG’s stark warning comes after Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister, said last week that checks on goods heading from great Britain to Northern Ireland would be needed to maintain “disease-free status” on the island of Ireland, with border inspection posts for agrifood. It contradicted Johnson’s repeated vow that there would be no checks. The IfG, however, suggests that more sweeping changes will be needed than those admitted by Gove. “The protocol creates a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea, which the UK will be legally obliged to administer under supervision from EU institutions,” it states. “Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK customs territory but will be required to align with EU rules on customs and regulations. “The UK government must recognise the scale of the implementation task and make it a government priority even in these difficult times. The UK needs to scale up existing systems for customs administration, design and implement new systems for tariff administration and compensation and develop new capacity for regulatory checks. “With UK ministers only recently publicly stating what additional processes may be needed, progress so far has been slow. With 64 departments, public bodies and agencies across the UK with scope for involvement in the implementation of the protocol, clarity on what is required is key.” Its analysis also warns that the protocol arrangements will be voted on by the Northern Ireland assembly every four to eight years, making it a “potentially destabilising issue” for years to come."
2020-05-23T11:57:47Z,politics,Politics,Lockdown row: key points Cummings and Johnson must address,"The Guardian first asked Downing Street on 5 April about whether Dominic Cummings had travelled to County Durham during the height of the lockdown. The response was: “It will be a no comment on that one.” Over the last seven weeks, neither Cummings nor No 10 have wanted to provide any on-the-record explanation about his whereabouts. With demands growing for Boris Johnson to sack his chief aide, Downing Street finally went public to defend Cummings on Saturday, but the explanation it provided appears to leave fundamental questions unanswered. 1) Why did Cummings travel hundreds of miles to Durham when he was displaying coronavirus symptoms? Downing Street’s statement says Cummings travelled north “owing to his wife being infected with suspected coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell. It was essential … to ensure his young child could be properly cared for.” His extended family had volunteered to help, it says. That may not wash for millions of people who respected the strict lockdown in place at the time. Cummings’s home is in London, and the government rules were specific: “You should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home.” Boris Johnson had implored people to stay at home and not visit relatives. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, underlined the point during the daily Downing Street press briefing on 3 April. “I end with the advice we all know. This advice is not a request, it is an instruction. Stay at home, protect lives and then you will be doing your part.” The Cabinet Office advice is also emphatic: “Leaving your home - the place you live - to stay at another home for a holiday or other purpose is not allowed. This includes visiting second homes.” 2) Who in Downing Street knew that Cummings had travelled out of London, and had they approved his actions? Anonymous briefings reported on Saturday by the BBC suggest that senior officials knew he had gone to Durham. But who? The chief medical officer in Scotland, Catherine Calderwood, quit in early April for visiting her second home during the coronavirus outbreak. Breaking the lockdown, or appearing to do so, was – and remains – a politically toxic issue. 3) How did Cummings get to the north-east? It’s a 264-mile journey. Did he stop off on the way, and if so where? At the time of his trip north, his wife, Mary Wakefield, was displaying symptoms of coronavirus. His boss, the prime minister, had just tested positive, as had the health secretary. Under those circumstances, should he not have self-isolated immediately? Who did he come into contact with on his way to Durham? 4) The Guardian asked No 10 again on 10 April about whether Cummings was in Durham. The paper said it had established through interviews with witnesses that he was in the north-east, in a potential breach of the government’s lockdown guidelines. Downing Street again refused to comment. Why? 5) The Guardian continued to investigate in an attempt to properly verify Cummings’ whereabouts. Durham police issued a statement on Friday saying it had acted on a complaint that “an individual had travelled from London to Durham … [and] that the individual in question was present and was self-isolating in part of the house”. The complaint was received on 31 March. According to the force, officers reminded Cummings’s family of “the guidelines around self-isolation and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel”. Downing Street insists that “at no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter”, despite reports to the contrary. The police have said they stand by their statement. So who is right? 6) In late April the Spectator published articles by Cummings and Wakefield, a commissioning editor at the magazine, which described their experiences of coping with the virus. Neither mentioned their whereabouts during the period when they were ill.
The Guardian asked Wakefield to clarify whether the family were in London at the time. There was no response. Downing Street said in its statement on Saturday that “Cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally”. If that’s the case, why has he been so coy about admitting he was in the north-east? How long was he there for, and when did he travel back to London?
7) On Friday, shortly after the Guardian and the Mirror were told about the complaint to the police, Downing Street was again asked to provide an explanation, almost seven weeks after the Guardian’s first approach on the issue. No 10 indicated that it did not have enough time to respond, but anonymous sources were briefing other media. No 10 said at 7pm it had been given “insufficient notice”, but within minutes of the story breaking at 8pm, an anonymous source “close to” Cummings confirmed to the BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, that he had travelled to Durham to stay in a building at his parents’ farm. Did Downing Street sanction these off-the-record briefings, and who gave them?"
2020-05-23T11:15:26Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings profile: aide at centre of lockdown breach row,"Described as the prime minister’s “Rasputin”, Dominic Cummings is no stranger to the spotlight. In fact he has made a career out of eschewing the rules and courting notoriety. He came to the fore as a special adviser to Michael Gove between 2007 and 2013, and attracted further attention as the chief administrative mastermind behind the successful leave campaign in the 2016 referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU.
After being appointed as the prime minister’s de facto chief of staff in the summer of 2019, he became one of the most powerful unelected political figures in the country. The appointment of the abrasive former campaign director was controversial, given he had been found to be in contempt of parliament earlier in the year for refusing to give evidence to MPs investigating misinformation. A longstanding Eurosceptic, Cummings has built a reputation as someone who does not play by the rules of conventional politics, and he was once called a “career psychopath” by the former prime minister David Cameron. His appointment as head of the Vote Leave campaign was dramatised in the Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War, which played up his role in covering a bus with the disputed £350m-a-week figure, arguing that the cash could be used to fund the NHS. He was in the headlines again after he posted an advert on his personal blog for “weirdos and misfits with odd skills” to work for the government. In the post he said career civil servants and “public school bluffers” in Whitehall were ill-equipped to take decisions about complex issues. Instead, he issued a recruitment call for mathematicians and data scientists to be given more prominence in the corridors of power, shaking up the civil service. In April it was revealed that Cummings had been present at meetings coordinating the response to the coronavirus pandemic as part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). This raised concerns over a lack of breadth of expertise in the meetings and political interference in science-based advice. Cummings, from Durham, in the north-east of England, has been known to play up his northern roots. His father, Robert, was an oil rig engineer and his mother, Morag, a teacher and behavioural specialist. He went to a state primary school and was then privately educated at the £16,000-a-year Durham School. He graduated from Oxford University with a first-class degree in modern history and spent some time in Russia, where he was involved with a failed attempt to launch an airline, among other projects. After a stint as campaign director for Business for Sterling, he spent eight months as chief strategy adviser to the then Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith. He played a key role in the 2004 campaign against an elected regional assembly in his native north-east. This turned out to be precursor to the Brexit campaign, with the North East Says No team winning the referendum by latching on to the anti-establishment mood that was beginning to spread among the public. Following this success he reportedly retreated to his father’s farm in County Durham to spend some time reading. He would re-emerge in 2007 as a special adviser to Gove, who became education secretary from 2010. Cummings is married to Mary Wakefield, a senior editor at the Spectator and the daughter of Sir Humphrey Wakefield. Cummings had previously been observed failing to follow the two-metre social distancing rules as he walked along Downing Street flanked by his fellow aide Cleo Watson on 14 April."
2020-05-23T08:42:22Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings row: what ministers have said about lockdown rules,"The importance of staying at home and not making unnecessary journeys, including to older relatives, has been hammered home since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. The government’s instructions were: “Only go outside for food, health reasons or work (but only if you cannot work from home); if you go out, stay two metres away from other people at all times; wash your hands as soon as you get home.” Crucially, they added: “Do not meet others, even friends or family. You can spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms.” Announcing school closures at a Downing Street briefing on 18 March, Boris Johnson urged families not to turn to older relatives to look after children. He said: “Children should not be left with older grandparents or older relatives who may be particularly vulnerable. I know that’s going to be difficult too and I want to thank families for their sacrifice at this difficult time.” At a No 10 briefing on 27 April, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “We understand the impact of not being able to hug your closest family. It affects us all too. We just hope we can get back to that as soon as possible. The best way we can get there, the fastest way, is for people to follow the rules.” Even now that lockdown rules have been eased slightly, visiting friends or family in their own homes is still off-limits. The current guidance states: “As with before, you cannot visit friends and family in their homes.” It also says: “We are advising those who are at increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus (Covid-19) to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures. This group includes those who are aged 70 or older (regardless of medical conditions). “If you are showing coronavirus symptoms, or if you or any of your household are self-isolating, you should stay at home – this is critical to staying safe and saving lives.”"
2020-05-22T19:00:32Z,politics,Politics,Pressure on Dominic Cummings to quit over lockdown breach,"Police spoke to Dominic Cummings about breaching the government’s lockdown rules after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had symptoms of coronavirus, the Guardian can reveal. Officers approached Boris Johnson’s key adviser days after he was seen rushing out of Downing Street when the prime minister tested positive for the virus at the end of March, a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Mirror has found. There are now calls for his resignation.
At the time, the government had instructed people not to travel and to stay at their family homes. Cummings, however, was seen in Durham. A member of the public is understood to have seen him and made a complaint to the police. When asked if Cummings had been warned about breaching the lockdown, a spokesman for Durham Constabulary said: “On Tuesday, March 31, our officers were made aware of reports that an individual had travelled from London to Durham and was present at an address in the city. “Officers made contact with the owners of that address who confirmed that the individual in question was present and was self-isolating in part of the house. “In line with national policing guidance, officers explained to the family the guidelines around self-isolation and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel.” Downing Street has previously refused to disclose where Cummings was staying during the lockdown. The Guardian has also been told Cummings was spotted near the gate of his parents’ home with a young child, believed to be his son, at around 5.45pm on Sunday 5 April, five days after the complaint was made to the police. This was just over a week after he began self-isolating with symptoms of the virus. It was also less than two hours before the prime minister was admitted to hospital after his symptoms worsened. The Guardian has previously asked Downing Street about this sighting in April, but officials declined to comment. The disclosure that Cummings was spoken to by police raises potentially awkward questions for him and No 10. With the UK in the grip of the pandemic, the government’s own advice urged everyone to stay at their main homes to avoid the spread of the virus and to save lives. “You should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home,” the guidance said. “The only exception is if they need help, such as having shopping or medication dropped off.” Instead, Cummings appears to have made the trip from his home in east London to Durham at a time when Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had tested positive. Downing Street said Cummings had developed symptoms “over the weekend” of the 28 and 29 March.
When questioned about Cummings’ whereabouts during the following week, a Downing Street spokesperson said only that he was in contact with No 10. A Durham resident who lives near the Cummings family home expressed shock and annoyance after the 5 April sighting. The witness, who did not wish to be named, told the Guardian: “I was really annoyed. I thought it’s OK for you to drive all the way up to Durham and escape from London. I sympathise with him wanting to do that, but other people are not allowed to do that. It’s one rule for Dominic Cummings and one rule for the rest of us.” Tulip Siddiq MP, the vice chair of the Labour party, said of the reports: “If accurate, the prime minister’s chief adviser appears to have breached the lockdown rules. The government’s guidance was very clear: stay at home and no non-essential travel. The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings. Number 10 needs to provide a very swift explanation for his actions.” The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, tweeted: “If Dominic Cummings has broken the lockdown guidelines he will have to resign. It’s as simple as that.” Ian Blackford, the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, said: “Dominic Cummings’ position is completely untenable – he must resign or be sacked.” Breaking lockdown rules has been a resigning issue for senior officials. Prof Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling prompted the lockdown, quit as a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) for flouting physical distancing rules when he was visited by his girlfriend. After he stood aside, senior Tories insisted he had done the right thing. Hancock said he was “speechless” and added: “I think he took the right decision to resign.” The former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said Ferguson’s behaviour “risks undermining the government’s lockdown message”. Scotland’s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, was also forced to quit after making two trips to her second home during the coronavirus lockdown. The sightings raise questions about the government’s commitment to the “stay at home” message it was repeating to the public in the first stage of the lockdown. The Guardian has already revealed that the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, travelled to his parents’ home on the same weekend. Jenrick said he was delivering medicine and essential supplies. Cummings was seen running through Downing Street on 27 March after it was announced that Johnson and Hancock had tested positive for coronavirus. Cummings and his wife, Mary Wakefield, an editor at the Spectator, last month gave a detailed account of how they coped under lockdown while having the symptoms of coronavirus. Writing in the magazine, Wakefield said that Cummings rushed home to look after her when she began showing symptoms. A day later he began feeling “weird” and then couldn’t get out of bed. “Day in, day out for 10 days he lay doggo with a high fever and spasms,” she said. The article goes on: “Just as Dom was beginning to feel better ... Boris was heading in the other direction, into hospital.” This was the evening when Cummings was first seen near Durham with the child. On the same evening, Scotland’s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, was forced to resign after she was photographed visiting her second home in Fife. Wakefield’s article does not say where they were during quarantine, but it adds: “After the uncertainty of the bug itself, we emerged from quarantine into almost comical uncertainty of London lockdown.” Wakefield has been asked to clarify whether the family were in their London home at the time. In the same issue of the Spectator, Cummings wrote: “At the end of March and for the first two weeks of April I was ill, so we were both shut in together.” He described the experience as “sticky … Everything is covered in a layer of spilt Ribena, honey, peanut butter and playschool glue.”
A witness said they were going past the Cummings family home on 5 April on their regular exercise route when they heard Abba’s Dancing Queen playing loudly from the property. “I got the shock of my life, as I looked over to the gates and saw him,” they said. “There was a child, presumably his little boy, running around in front. I recognised Dominic Cummings, he’s a very distinctive figure.” Despite the mild weather that weekend, they said Cummings was wearing a dark coat and thick tartan scarf. “He must have been wearing them to protect himself while recovering from Covid-19,” they said. The Guardian approached Downing Street for comment but had not received a response by the time of publication. matthew.weaver@theguardian.com"

2020-05-22T16:14:41Z,politics,Politics,Shadow disabilities minister says Commons return is discriminatory,"The shadow disabilities minister has claimed she is being discriminated against by the government’s decision to end the virtual parliament and suggest MPs return to Westminster in person. Vicky Foxcroft, who has rheumatoid arthritis and is shielding on government advice as she takes immunosuppressant medication, said she would not be able to vote in person when parliament returns after the Whitsun recess. Instead she will be asked to “pair” with a Conservative MP so that neither cast a vote, thereby cancelling each other out. She also has significant concerns that she will not be able to take part in bill committees because no video provision will be made. The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has said he expects MPs to return on 2 June because the temporary hybrid system that allowed members to dial in by video-link is not allowing full scrutiny or lawmaking to take place. Foxcroft, who holds Lewisham Deptford for Labour, said: “I am being disenfranchised from being able to contribute to parliament. As shadow disabilities minister I know people are feeling cut off and naturally I have a lot of important matters that I want to raise about this very matter. “Right the way through this crisis disabled people have been discriminated against. They need to be at the heart of decision-making and not just an after-thought. They need to be a consideration right from the start of policymaking. The very fact the shadow disabilities minister is being disenfranchised from parliament is yet another example of poor policymaking.” Rees-Mogg has said he is continuing to work with Commons authorities to find ways for MPs to contribute to proceedings. On voting, he told MPs on Wednesday that if people wanted to make an argument for the longer term about remote voting, they were entitled to do so, but it was “an argument for another day”. Foxcroft, 42, who was diagnosed last year, said it took her a lot longer than other people to heal and there were knock-on effects from having a low immune system. For example, a common cold can last up to four weeks. Her health could be seriously endangered if she was to contract coronavirus, and like other people with certain conditions she has been asked to shield herself until 30 June. However, MPs are expected back in just over 10 days’ time. The Conservative chair of the education select committee, Robert Halfon, who has cerebral palsy and osteoarthritis, said the request for MPs to return to Westminster and end the hybrid parliament was effectively “euthanising’ some members from the Commons. Foxcroft said online voting had been a vital tool for people in her situation and there was no reason for it to be abandoned. From 2 June, any divisions will require MPs to pass through the lobbies with a two-metre distance between them. To avoid people bunching together to file past the clerks, they will be ticked off remotely by clerks using a video screen. The Commons is expected to publish a risk assessment of how parliament can return at the end of next week. Only MPs are being asked to return because their work is deemed essential. Their staff can remain working from home. A Commons spokesperson said: “The Speaker continues to be very sympathetic to those who need to stay at home because they are vulnerable, shielding or have caring responsibilities, and continues to represent the views of those MPs affected to both the leader of the house and chief whip.” Foxcroft said that throughout the pandemic there had been concerns about the way disabled people have been treated, from access to online food shopping to the significant cost of personal protective equipment they are supplying for the people who look after them. The government has said councils have dedicated Covid-19 helplines designed to offer emergency support, and the Cabinet Office Disability Unit regularly engages with a wide range of disabled persons charities and organisations. • This article was amended on 25 May 2020. An earlier version mistakenly said Foxcroft would “be asked to pair with an opposition MP”."
2020-05-22T14:42:35Z,politics,Politics,UK has too much at stake to confront China over Hong Kong,"There is widespread frustration at the British government’s muted initial response to China’s plans to impose new security laws in Hong Kong, raising the perennial questions about what the UK can realistically do to persuade China to protect the territory’s cherished freedoms. Johnny Patterson, the chief executive of Hong Kong Watch, described the UK’s response so far to the planned crackdown as “limp, inane and could have been copied and pasted directly from their previous statements”. “It was utterly inappropriate given the gravity of the situation,” he said. “Beijing’s decision to impose the worst kind of draconian legislation without consulting the [Hong Kong] legislative council is a direct breach of the handover agreement. Given Britain’s moral and legal duties as co-signatories of that settlement, the prime minister should be leading the way in calling it out and drawing together like-minded countries to coordinate a joint response.” A subsequent UK, Canada and Australia statement issued on Friday was tougher in tone. Arguably, the chances of forcing China to rethink are dependent not on the UK government – which handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 under a 50-year form of semi-autonomy known as one country, two systems – but largely on the reactions of others, notably the markets, the people of Hong Kong and the US Senate. The UK, as former colonial power and joint signatory of the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration, could seek to persuade Chinese diplomats that the destruction of Hong Kong’s freedoms will destroy its economic value to China. It could also warn that the measures will provoke the kind of street protests that forced China to shelve a clampdown the last time this was attempted, in 2003. Months of new protests would only damage Beijing’s image, already tarnished by allegations of a coronavirus cover-up and negligence. The UK Foreign Office could privately lobby the US to end Hong Kong’s preferential trading status by declaring it is no longer an autonomous jurisdiction. Moves to this effect are already under way on a bipartisan basis in the US, and could become a focus of revived plans for a G7 leaders’ meeting in Washington next month. The UK foreign affairs select committee chairman, Tom Tugenhadt, applauded the tough initial US response, saying: “Beijing is killing the one country, two systems model followed by all President Xi’s predecessors. He’s turning his back on the past.” Apart from that, the UK in extremis could offer sanctuary to as many as 150,000 British national overseas passport owners in Hong Kong – something the Home Office has resisted but which has support from the liberal internationalists on the Tory benches. But the government is leery of confronting China or enlisting in Donald Trump’s trade war on the country. At both official and business level, cooperation between China and the UK remains intense. In recent weeks the chancellor, the health secretary and the deputy national security adviser have all spoken with the Chinese ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming. The golden era hailed by the former prime minister David Cameron may be over, but the UK does not favour Trump’s economic decoupling. The UK is the number one European destination for Chinese foreign investment, which in the past five years has equalled the sum in the previous 30 years. China is also the UK’s third largest market. Trade has slumped in recent months but may rebound. Indeed Liu, speaking to 1,500 CBI members in a webinar on Wednesday, portrayed the UK and China as “the flagbearers for free trade and globalisation beyond Covid-19”, contrasting that alliance with Trump’s protectionism and flouting of a rules-based order. In the view of Nicolas Veron, of the Brussels-based thinktank Bruegel, it is almost as if the UK, weakened after Brexit, could become a site of competition or testing ground between China and the US as they each seek the UK’s allegiance. The ambassador seemed confident that the UK government was not about to turn against his country. “We heard some politicians spreading this argument for ‘decoupling’, and some even go so far as to preaching the cold war rhetoric against China, and that is very harmful. I had webinars with the Chinese business community because they are very concerned. They do not know how pervasive, how massive and how influential this rhetoric is. I had good conversations with British secretaries and senior officials, and they told me these words did not represent the UK government position, and I believe that.” He was speaking before the Chinese Communist party made its move on Hong Kong, but it was a reminder of how the UK today has more at stake than the civil rights of its former colony. It looks like the first true test of Boris Johnson’s Global Britain."
2020-05-22T14:39:15Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson may meet Donald Trump at G7 summit in US next month,"Boris Johnson may meet Donald Trump face to face at the G7 summit in the US next month, after Downing Street said it was still exploring the arrangements for the event. The meeting of global leaders is scheduled for 10 June, with Trump saying he would like it to be held at Camp David, the president’s rural estate.
He tweeted that hosting it face to face would be a signal to the world of “normalisation” amid the coronavirus pandemic and that other countries involved in the summit were starting to make their own “comeback”. The UK prime minister’s spokesperson said: “We are in close contact with the White House about the summit and we will look at the details of what they are proposing.” A physical summit was cancelled in March with the intention of it being transferred to video conferencing. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said he would consider the summit proposals but discussions were ongoing. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he was open to attending. The state of Maryland, which is home to Camp David, issued an executive order in April that residents should wear face masks in public settings. Trump and the US vice-president, Mike Pence, have been criticised for appearing in public without masks, despite health officials encouraging Americans to wear them.
Asked if Johnson would attend the event and wear a mask, the prime minister’s spokesperson said: “[Those] arrangements are a matter for the home country.” The government plans to release more details on Friday of the 14-day quarantine proposals for UK arrivals, which include some exemptions. When asked whether Johnson’s potential trip to the US would incur a two-week quarantine period on his return, his spokesman said: “You’ll see the list of exemptions later on, but the prime minister would follow the guidelines.” By hosting the event in person, Trump has raised questions over whether the typically large delegations that accompany leaders to the G7 would be attending, what physical distancing measures would be in place and how journalists from around the world would report on the summit.
Trump had intended to focus the G7 meeting on the economy, eschewing the more traditional subject of climate change. Earlier this year he had planned to host the talks in Miami, at his Trump National Doral golf resort, however this was switched to Camp David, where the president has spent several weekends during the coronavirus pandemic."
2020-05-22T12:09:18Z,politics,Politics,"Kit or miss? In these bleak times, I want to believe in the bunny that got away | John Crace","Monday Just when you think things can’t get much more surreal, we hear that Donald Trump has been dosing himself up with the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine in efforts to ward off the coronavirus that he doesn’t yet have. “I’m taking it for about a week and a half now and I’m still here, I’m still here,” he told reporters during a White House briefing. Given that hydroxychloroquine is not a vaccine, is completely unproven as a treatment for Covid-19 and can have dangerous side-effects, you can only wonder about the president’s state of mind. And that of his medical team who are happily prescribing him a drug that is far more likely to do him harm than good. Next he’ll be hooking himself up on a ventilator at night. I thought my hypochondria was bad – I’ve lost count of the number of times over the past 10 weeks when I’ve woken up with a slight headache or the merest hint of a sore throat and imagined I had the virus – but it’s never occurred to me to start dosing myself up with remdesivir. It would be like me marching into the doctor’s and demanding to be put on a course of chemotherapy on the off chance that I had cancer. Or having elective surgery to remove my appendix to ensure that I don’t get peritonitis. Tuesday Two weeks back my daughter was tidying her garden in Minneapolis when she came across a small burrow of tiny, furless animals, with their eyes shut, that were clearly no more than a day or so old. She sent me a picture and we wondered if they might be moles, before someone pointed out they were above ground, had large ears and were obviously rabbits. Anna even got round to setting up a webcam so she could check up on them at all times, and we got used to watching the mother returning from time to time to feed them and scrape her fur to keep them warm. At a time when so much else in the world seemed so bleak, they came to represent something new and hopeful. A week or so ago, we got the call that we had been dreading. The webcam had picked up a neighbour’s cat entering the burrow. When Anna went out to check up on them, there was no sign of the bunnies. Then today, Anna was looking out of her kitchen window and spotted a small rabbit at the bottom of her garden. It was almost certainly from a different burrow, but I would like to believe it was one that had escaped the carnage and come back to let us know that just occasionally the natural world can provide a happy ending. Wednesday Boris Johnson sold himself to many voters at the last election as the great communicator: the leader who could unite a divided country and get Brexit done. So it’s been a surprise to find just how invisible he’s been since recovering from the coronavirus. He’s given one confusing TV statement – with no questions allowed – and sent out junior cabinet ministers in his place at the Downing Street press conference. One explanation for his absenteeism over the last week has been that he was so wounded by his mauling from Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions that he had spent the last seven days preparing for this week’s encounter. If so, it only partially paid off: Boris was much more of his usual aggressive, unpleasant self, but the Labour leader still came out comfortably ahead on points. Not least because Boris insisted that all those overseas nationals who were working on low salaries in the NHS would have to pay a visa surcharge of £624 to access health services if they got ill while doing their jobs of trying to keep the rest of us alive. It was so obviously unjust and immoral that Boris was shamed into doing a massive U-turn the following day. There was no screeching reversal, however, on him forcing through a vote preventing MPs from accessing Commons proceedings remotely at a time when the official government policy is still for people to work from home if they possibly can. When recess ends in 10 days’ time, the only MPs able to join in the debate will be the 50 or so allowed in under the physical distancing guidelines. So MPs from constituencies remote from London will be in effect disenfranchised. Some would call it a scandal. Boris calls it taking back control. Thursday We need to talk about Kevin. Again. Last week I wrote about my friend Kevin’s experience of coronavirus testing as performance art. What neither of us had realised was that he was only in the first act of the play. Two weeks to the day after his initial test, for which he was never able to get the results, he was offered a second test. On Monday this week he went off to have that second test. The following day a result of “unclear” arrived back, so a further test was required. However, what was also unclear was whether the result was from the first or second test. Kevin rang the ironically named helpdesk which, as ever, had no information and put him on hold for several minutes. After a discussion with all of his colleagues, the adviser reported back that they had unanimously concluded that the result couldn’t have come from the second test as they had never known of an instance when the system had been that efficient. So on the basis of their absolute certainty of the incompetence of the system, they say he should ring back next Monday to find out if the series is to be extended to a third test. And the government wonders why the whole country doesn’t share its excitement when it announces a new testing programme. Friday I’ve watched more of the Downing Street press briefings than I care to remember and will have to endure many more before the pandemic is over. Though sadly I will miss Priti Patel’s outing this evening as the home secretary is such a liability she is only allowed out in public when no sketch writers are writing for the following day. Already though, there are signs that the government is regretting its decision to give the country daily updates, not least because more often than not the minister taking the press conference – Boris has long since decided these are too much like hard work and can’t be bothered to turn up – has nothing new to announce. So on Thursday we were treated to Matt Hancock running through the same slides that have been used in every other briefing for the past two weeks, before being forced to admit that the “world-beating” test, track and trace app that he had insisted only a month or so ago would be a game-changer in easing lockdown restrictions wasn’t going to be ready in time. And, in any case, it wasn’t such a big deal as all that and had only ever been intended to be an adjunct to human track and trace. Most of us would just settle for solutions that were good enough to make a difference. Still, in these days of existential despair, just occasionally something remarkable does happen. I had been checking on the status of my exercise bike I had ordered from Amazon and had been informed that the one I had ordered was now indefinitely unavailable, so I had mentally prepared myself for the likelihood it would never appear. Then, out of the blue, I got an email saying it would arrive on 3 June. Even more remarkably, it turned up two weeks early and was comparatively simple to assemble. It has been the best £229 I have spent for a long time. Nearly an hour free from anxiety about the coronavirus and thoughts of missing my family and friends. What more could anyone want? Digested week, digested: Starmer 3-0 Johnson.

2020-05-22T10:42:05Z,politics,Politics,UK and EU clash over crime-fighting database in Brexit talks,"EU officials have accused the British government of threatening to weaken security cooperation with the bloc unless the UK gets an equivalent to a major crime-fighting database. The UK is set to lose access to the Schengen Information System (SIS II), a massive EU database, where police across the continent share millions of pieces of information on criminal suspects, at the end of the year. The EU has said it is legally impossible for non-EU countries not respecting free movement of people to access the database and has proposed more basic information sharing. In the latest round of Brexit talks, UK negotiators told their EU counterparts that the offer wasn’t good enough. According to EU sources, the UK government threatened to walk away from information sharing if it could not have an equivalent to the SIS II database, which is used by British police every day. “The UK basically said it was not interested in what the EU suggested and that if they can’t have it then they would rather have nothing. So they are playing hardball,” said one EU official. “We have opened discussions on this,” said a second EU source. “They were not interested in anything that does not replicate the benefits of SIS II.” A UK government source described the EU account as “highly misleading” but did not deny rejecting the lesser offer. “What we are seeking is a future internal security agreement with the EU which provides capabilities similar to those delivered by SIS II, but I’m afraid the EU’s alternative proposals on data sharing are nowhere near reminiscent of this and are of limited operational value,” the source said. The Schengen Information System was created in 1995 by countries that had abolished internal border controls. In 2015 Theresa May, who was then the home secretary, took the UK into the database, securing an unprecedented special deal for a country outside the EU passport-free travel zone. During the EU referendum campaign experts warned Brexit imperilled access to the database and would damage the UK’s ability to fight terrorism and crime. British police and border guards are the third heaviest users of the database, making 571m searches in 2019 (a figure that includes automated bulk data sweeps) to look for wanted people or stolen goods. UK forces issued 36,680 alerts on people and 259,824 on vehicles in 2019 – essentially a request to other police to carry out checks. The government wants a system with “capabilities similar to those delivered by SIS II” meaning access to real-time data on tens of thousands of people. The EU offer, it argues, would add nothing to the UK’s law enforcement capability. EU negotiators want to maintain police data sharing with the UK, but say their hands are tied because of case law from the European court of justice (ECJ) that limits what can be offered to an outsider. European diplomats also cite political factors such the UK’s refusal to countenance a role for the ECJ and opposition to any reference to the European court of human rights (ECHR) in the EU-UK treaty. Both institutions are seen by European governments as providing crucial safeguards over the transfer of data or – in the case of the European arrest warrant – people. “We wanted of course to have an exchange of data, but it cannot be SIS as such,” an EU diplomat said, citing the absence of guarantees on the ECJ and ECHR. The Brexit clash comes after a prominent MEP accused the UK government of “behaving like cowboys” earlier this year, after a leaked EU report concluded that British authorities had illegally copied SIS II data. The report fuelled complaints that the UK wants the benefits of EU systems without offering reciprocal aid – a charge strongly rejected by the government. In 2018 the UK responded to 7,000 alerts put on the SIS II system by other countries, while it issued more than 22,500 alerts that led to responses around the EU."
2020-05-21T20:05:15Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock is not OK. Someone really ought to furlough him | John Crace,"There’s sometimes a fine line between a government reacting nimbly to events and one that appears to be totally at sea. But right now Boris Johnson is working flat out to make it abundantly clear that his government has chosen to firmly come down on the side of complete cluelessness. On Wednesday at prime minister’s questions, Boris had been clear. It was entirely right for people from overseas working in the NHS and social care sectors to pay a £624 visa surcharge to use the NHS themselves. After all, if they were going to come over here and try to save people’s lives – the prime minister’s included – then they ought to pay for the privilege. It was just common sense. People working on the front line were far more likely to get coronavirus, so they could well end up using NHS resources that should have been available to hardworking Brits who wouldn’t dream of doing such a highly skilled job for so little money. Call it the Corona Cough-Up. Midway through Thursday, though – after a lot of pushback from all opposition parties and several of his own MPs – Boris had a change of heart. NHS staff and care workers would be exempt from the surcharge. Though, needless to say, all other workers who helped keep the NHS up and running, such as delivery drivers and childminders, would still get fleeced. Because they were all still slackers and freeloaders. So you might have thought that Boris might want to use the daily Downing Street press conference as a platform to explain his unexpected fit of compassion and largesse. Or even to express his delight that the police had decided that doing financial favours for someone he had been doing IT with was no big deal. Only, Boris doesn’t do press briefings any more. Or anything much. Can’t be arsed. Why should the prime minister explain anything to anyone during the worst health crisis in 100 years? It was a nice afternoon, he was about to go on a 10-day Whitsun break with Carrie, Dilyn the dog and some baby that had mysteriously appeared in Downing Street, and he could do without the hassle. And it had been a whole two months since he’d taken 10 days off right at the beginning of the pandemic. In any case, he’d already had coronavirus, so he was just fine. Inevitably, then, it was Matt Hancock who got lumbered with the press conference. Matt gets landed with all the shit jobs right now and he’s resigned to the fact that he’s been set up as the fall guy. Old habits die hard with the health secretary. His natural demeanour as the enthusiastic class nerd, whose exercise books are full of high-school massacre fantasies, is hardwired into his personality. He longs to stand up to the prime minister, but instinctively crumbles. He justifies it as furthering his career, but there’s a tragic sadness to his ambition these days. As if he knows he ran out of road several weeks back, but can’t help himself. Matt opened by talking about mental health awareness week. “It is OK to not be OK,” he said. These were the only true and heartfelt words he said throughout the hour. Because he was talking to himself as much as anyone following the briefing on TV. Matt is not OK. He hasn’t been OK for a while. He’s become snappier, more short-tempered. He’s aged visibly over the past few months. Lines have appeared on his shiny, prepubescent face. In time, we might see hints of acne. If anyone in the cabinet really cared about his mental health, they’d put Matt on a furlough scheme for several months. After monotoning his way through a spiel about various tests that he knows no one would take seriously, as the government has failed on just about every promise it has so far made during the crisis, Matt came to the bit he had been dreading: the questions. Inevitably, first up was Johnson’s U-turn on the visa surcharge. Here was his chance to stick up for himself, to say he had never believed in it and it had only ever been some vindictive scheme dreamed up by Boris and Priti Patel to keep Brexiters happy. But Matt didn’t have the self-worth to be anything other than a lapdog. Boris had misunderstood Keir Starmer at PMQs and had imagined he was talking about the surcharge in general and not just for NHS workers. Matt was now in so deep that the lies began to slip off the tongue with increasing ease. Yes, the government was all over social care, and no person would be asked to sell their home to pay for their care. Which will come as news to my mother, who had to sell hers to pay for her care. But the health secretary’s worst moment came when he was asked about his “test, track and trace app” that only a few weeks ago he was telling the country would be key to easing lockdown restrictions, but has now gone missing in action. It was due to be launched nationwide in mid-May, but now Matt can’t even bring himself to mention it in polite conversation. Selective amnesia. What app? Oh, that app. Well, when he had said it was vital, what he had really meant was that it was utterly peripheral. In fact, in many ways it was far better that the test and track process begin without the app, as it was far better to have tracking from people who had scarcely been given any training in what they were doing. Everything was going to be fine – just not yet. After a question about restarting football from Robbie Savage – basically, just forget it – Matt slipped away. It had been an ordeal. But no worse than the one Boris probably has lined up for him tomorrow. Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair."
2020-05-21T15:50:44Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson and Jennifer Arcuri â€“ timeline,"Boris Johnson has avoided a criminal investigation into his relationship with the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri while he was mayor of London. But the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has recommended that the Greater London Authority conduct a review. Here is a timeline of the saga: March 2011 Johnson and his staff are given compulsory training on the importance of acknowledging personal friendships after the mayor was rebuked for failing to declare an interest in Helen Macintyre. She was an unpaid adviser who had an extramarital affair with Johnson and gave birth to his daughter in 2008.
13 October 2011 Johnson meets Arcuri for the first time at a summit of venture capitalists at the Landmark hotel in London. Arcuri, who was a business student at the time, later admitted blagging her way into the event by pretending to be the president of a venture capital club. Recalling the encounter, Arcuri said: “It was just electrifying to see that kind of personality change the complete energy of the room … I walked right over and I said: Mr Johnson, my name is Jennifer Arcuri. I would really love it if you’d come speak at my venture capital event.” February 2012 Arcuri meets Johnson for a second time, at Euston station, at the start of a “Back Boris” event as part of his mayoral re-election campaign. 13 April 2012 Arcuri persuades Johnson to be the keynote speaker at the launch of Innotech at the Hult business school where she had studied. Video of the event shows Johnson saying: “Viva Innotech folks, and forward with all your deliberations. Will that do Jennifer? Can I go yet?” 16 December 2012 Arcuri tells a friend she is meeting “AtheGreat” for lunch the next day. Arcuri stored Johnson’s number on her phone as “Alexander the Great” in reference to his real first name.
18 February 2013 An email from the mayor’s promotional agency, London & Partners (L&P), describes Arcuri as “close to Boris”. 28 February 2013 Arcuri tells Johnson’s communications director, Will Walden, that she “spoke to the man last night” when she appeared to be trying to book the mayor to speak at one of her conferences. Johnson’s diary for 27 February 2013 lists eight appointments, but the last two on that day are redacted because they relate to personal information about the mayor. 26 April 2013 Johnson speaks at an Innotech event at Canary Wharf. 31 October 2013 L&P sponsors an event at the World Islamic Economic Forum in London, at a cost of £10,000 plus VAT. Johnson speaks at the event, saying: “I’m always happy to hang out at Innotech.” June 2014 L&P pays £1,500 plus VAT in sponsorship for Arcuri’s Tech vs Brains event on the terrace at the House of Commons. 20 October 2014 Johnson speaks at an Innotech event at Bafta in London.
November 2014 Arcuri applies to attend a trade mission in Singapore. When she applied under her company Innotech, the application was declined. But it was approved under her new company Playbox. 1 December 2014 Arcuri travels to Kuala Lumpur with Johnson on a trade mission and meets Johnson’s half-brother Max.
11 February 2015 Arcuri attends a trade mission with Johnson in New York despite failing to meet the criteria for attendees. A Johnson aide recalled: “I never discussed Jennifer Arcuri with him except when we did a briefing for the trip to the US. When the guest list was read, he rolled his eyes because there was a kind of like ‘oh good old Jennifer’ sort of thing, and that was this.”
November 2015 Arcuri attends a trade mission in Tel Aviv alongside Johnson, again despite failing to meet the criteria for attendees. January 2019 Arcuri’s new company Hacker House is awarded a £100,000 cyber-skills grant intended for UK-operating businesses. The digital minister at the time, Margot James, later said she was “totally appalled” that the company had been given the money over concerns about its tenuous links with the UK. But a government review in October concluded that it was “appropriate”. 22 September 2019 The Sunday Times reveals that Arcuri was given tens of thousands of pounds in public funds and access to overseas trade missions led by Johnson during his time as mayor. 28 September 2019 The Greater London Authority formally refers Johnson to the IOPC to consider whether he committed the criminal offence of misconduct in public office over allegations of conflict of interest with Arcuri. 21 May 2020 The IOPC concludes that no criminal investigation is required but it says Johnson should have declared an interest in the businesswoman, after finding evidence that officials were influenced by the close relationship between the pair. The London assembly’s oversight committee announces it will resume its inquiry into Johnson’s conduct. The IOPC also recommends that the Greater London Authority conduct a review of L&P policies and processes around the payment of sponsorship money."
2020-05-21T15:45:29Z,politics,Politics,"Government will push for green coronavirus recovery, says Tory MP","The government is poised to push for a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis, one of the new Tory party MPs has said, in a way that could wipe out the mistakes made in shutting down the coal industry under Margaret Thatcher. “I very much hope we will hear about a green recovery soon from ministers,” said Alexander Stafford, who took one of Labour’s “red wall” seats in northern England in last December’s landslide election victory. “We want a recovery, we want it green, so we will work for a green recovery.” Stafford is MP for Rother Valley in Yorkshire, site of the infamous Battle of Orgreave during the miner’s strike in 1984. He said the move away from coal in the 1980s under the Conservatives had produced upheaval and job losses, which could be avoided in a green recovery if people’s skills were redeployed to renewable energy and other clean technology. “If people lose their jobs and their livelihoods, they are not going to be on board with the green message,” he said. “In the 1980s under Thatcher, the closure of the coal mines, there was a cliff edge, a cut-off, that created lots of social problems and economic problems. We need to manage the transition better. We can’t leave anyone behind. If we leave people behind, we will lose goodwill and public support.” The UK was in prime position to create a “huge bonanza of jobs” in renewable energy and other green industries, he told the Guardian. “In the 1980s there was no support for mining workers. People were not properly equipped to look to new jobs. We have to support people into jobs.” The coronavirus crisis had heightened people’s awareness of how the economy could be changed, he said. “We have the opportunity to reshape our economy.”
He contrasted the public’s willingness to look to green economic growth with the activism and civil disobedience of Extinction Rebellion. “They are extreme, and it is not working,” he said. “It needs to be done in a way that shows the economic benefits that a green recovery could bring. “Extinction Rebellion has made [the climate crisis] very visible, but they have gone far too far with their direct action, way beyond the pale, and that puts people off.” Stafford, who worked for the green campaigning charity WWF and then oil giant Shell before entering parliament, said the influx of new MPs was supportive of green measures. “This is one of the most effective internal lobby groups in the party,” he told a webinar on the green recovery held on Thursday by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a green advisory group. One of the first policies for a green recovery could be home insulation, he said. The government currently has no overarching strategy for improving the energy efficiency of the UK’s draughty homes, an omission that has caused a slump in the number of homes being insulated in the last five years. The Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory adviser, has written to the prime minister to urge measures including a boost to home insulation, renewable energy, electric vehicle infrastructure, tree planting and the restoration of peatlands, all of which it said would create new green jobs quickly and reduce the UK’s emissions in line with long-term low-carbon goals. A study by Oxford University earlier this month found that focusing on the green economy would produce greater returns for public money, in the short and long term, than pouring cash into a conventional fossil-fuelled recovery. Ministers have said little publicly on how the recovery from the coronavirus crisis might be achieved in a way compatible with the UK’s long-term goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, as attention has focused on the immediate health and economic crises. On Thursday, the business secretary, Alok Sharma, announced £40m in new funding for fledgling green startups. Earlier this week, the Labour party told the Guardian of its proposals for a “low-carbon army”, building on the plans for a “green industrial revolution” in the party’s manifesto last year."
2020-05-21T14:12:59Z,politics,Politics,Lib Dem peer says sorry for claiming furlough and Lords allowance,"A Liberal Democrat lord accused of “milking the taxpayer” by taking money from the government’s furlough scheme and claiming his peer’s allowance has apologised and said he will repay the Treasury. Lord Fox, the party’s business spokesperson in the House of Lords, has used the job retention scheme to pay himself as the owner of a strategic communications firm and claimed his £162 daily allowance for his work as a peer. The Telegraph reported he had a £100,000 cash pot in his company and owned two homes worth more than £2m. Fox said on Thursday: “I recognise my error in judgment and I apologise. I have already begun to repay the money I received as part of the furlough scheme and intend to repay the full amount as soon as possible.” The Tory MP Richard Halfon said Fox had been “milking the taxpayer at both ends” and urged him to repay the money. He said the scheme had not been intended for people of Fox’s means. Fox said he had not used the £100,000 pot because he was hoping to tide over the business and relaunch it once the restrictions around the coronavirus pandemic had eased. He also said that had it been inappropriate to draw on the money from the government then HMRC would have told him. He is the sole employee of Vulpes Advisory and had taken an initial payment from the furlough scheme for one month’s wage subsidy of around £1,000. His work on the House of Lords economic affairs committee, which is being done virtually, has involved four sessions so far, for which he was entitled to claim about £650. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “We’ve made the furlough scheme available to support all employees in the UK, should it be required. “It’s for particular individuals to explain why they have chosen to apply to the scheme for the people they employ. “Our focus has always been on the employees, and providing the support they need to keep them connected to the labour market. “From our point of view, it’s a scheme that exists to support employees across the country, should they need help – and one of the key reasons for it is to allow people to remain attached to the workplace.”"
2020-05-21T13:01:13Z,politics,Politics,Questions remain for Boris Johnson over Jennifer Arcuri,"Boris Johnson struggled to keep his private life out of the public eye even before he met Jennifer Arcuri. But his relationship with the American businesswoman has been the most awkward for him. While he has escaped a criminal investigation by the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC), he will still face difficult questions from a City Hall watchdog about their friendship while he was the mayor of London, and why he didn’t declare it. The nature of the relationship became the subject of public scrutiny after it emerged last year that Arcuri had benefited from thousands of pounds in public money, including from the mayor’s promotional agency, London and Partners (L&P). She was also given coveted places on trade missions to New York and Tel Aviv alongside Johnson, despite failing to meet the criteria for those trips. Her place on the trips was allegedly secured after intervention from the mayor’s office. Emails from officials about Arcuri’s place on those trips was among evidence examined by the IOPC before it decided to take no further action. One, from February 2013, described Arcuri as being “close to Boris”. Another said Arcuri had been “speaking to Boris” and one of his officials about her being in New York at the time of the trade mission, and they were “both apparently happy with that”. Those emails are now likely to form a key part of an investigation by the London assembly’s oversight committee, which had put its inquiry on hold in deference to the IOPC. While deciding against a criminal investigation, the IOPC’s 112-page report did conclude that Johnson should have declared an interest, and that this failure could have amounted to a breach of the Greater London assembly’s code of conduct. It said his failure to ensure a “complete separation between him and this decision-making” over places on trade missions “cold be construed as a breach of the broader Nolan principles in the sense that he could see that Ms Arcuri was obtaining a networking opportunity via the mayor’s own business enterprise agency (L&P)”. It also found “evidence to suggest that those officers making decisions about sponsorship monies and attendance on trade missions thought that there was a close relationship between Mr Johnson and Ms Arcuri, and this influenced their decision-making”. Johnson has maintained that he had no interest to declare over Arcuri, but she says otherwise. After the pair met in 2011 at an “electrifying” encounter in October 2011, the then mayor made up to 10 visits to her home office in Shoreditch, she has said. And he spoke for free at four events hosted by Arcuri and her start-up company, Innotech.
Johnson was aware of how the relationship would be construed, according to Arcuri. And she was frustrated by his unwillingness to officially acknowledge what she later described as a “very special relationship”. However, there was no mention of Arcuri or her company in the mayor’s official list of interests, and his official diary made no mention of her. It recorded only two of the four Innotech events where he spoke. On 28 February 2013, Arcuri told Johnson’s communications director, Will Walden, that she “spoke to the man last night” when she appeared to be trying to book the mayor to speak at one of her conferences. Johnson’s diary for 27 February 2013 lists eight appointments, but the last two are redacted because they relate to personal information about the mayor. Johnson refused to answer Arcuri’s calls as news of their friendship broke in the Sunday Times last year. It was this that appears in part to have motivated her to give several broadcast and print interviews. “Why should I remain silent if you can’t even speak to me?” she told Johnson through an interview with the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire show. She complained that she had been “fed to the lions”.
Arcuri has repeatedly insisted that she secured funds and favours on merit, but she acknowledged that Johnson should have been transparent about the relationship. “He knew there was a potential for conflict, and this is why he never did anything,” she told Bloomberg. By contrast, Johnson has insisted that he had nothing to declare and had acted with “full propriety”. However, he could not claim ignorance of the rules. Months before Johnson met Arcuri, he and his staff were given compulsory training on the importance of acknowledging personal friendships. The training was insisted upon by City Hall’s standards committee after it rebuked Johnson for failing to acknowledge his personal relationship with Helen Macintyre, an unpaid adviser who gave birth to his daughter in 2008. Judging by Arcuri’s account, the training had little effect. She told ITV: “He used to always get worried[, saying]: ‘People are going to question about my interest’. And I say: ‘No they won’t, because I’m here because of my own right’.” While Johnson has always been reluctant to acknowledge their friendship, Arcuri has conversely been boastful. “I’ve got Boris wrapped around my little finger,” Mike Butcher, the editor of Tech Crunch, recalls her saying at the time. She listed Johnson as “Alexander the Great” on her phone, in reference to Johnson’s first name. In December 2012, she told a friend she was seeing “AtheGreat” for lunch. She had a cake made for one of the events where he spoke that included three icing figurines of Johnson, which she later ate for the camera. Johnson’s friendliness with Arcuri was plain to see in video footage of his Innotech appearances. “I’m always happy to hang out at Innotech,” he told an event in 2014. At a launch event for the company in 2012 he said: “Viva Innotech, folks, and forward with all your deliberations. Will that do, Jennifer? Can I go yet?” Announcing the resumption of the London assembly inquiry, Len Duvall, a Labour member who chairs the oversight committee, said: “Everyone who holds public office, whether you’re the mayor of London, or indeed the prime minister, is expected to adhere to the principles of public life – including integrity, selflessness, openness and honesty, to name a few. “Our investigation will consider whether Boris Johnson conducted himself in a way that’s expected from anyone in that position. It’s important we get those answers, because Londoners deserve to have their politicians held accountable.”"
2020-05-21T12:00:34Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson will not face criminal inquiry over Jennifer Arcuri,"Boris Johnson has avoided a criminal investigation into his relationship with the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri while he was mayor of London. But he will face a further investigation into his conduct when he was mayor, after the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found evidence that officials were influenced by the close relationship between the pair. Johnson was formally referred to the watchdog in September because he was the head of the mayor’s office for policing and crime at a time when Arcuri received public money and access to trade trips led by him when he was mayor. Arcuri was awarded thousands of pounds in public money, including £11,500 by the mayor’s promotional agency London & Partners (L&P). Johnson’s office also intervened to give her a place on trade missions to New York and Tel Aviv with Johnson, after she was initially turned down because she failed to meet the criteria. The IOPC concluded that no criminal inquiry was required following an eight-month scoping exercise into whether Johnson should be investigated for misconduct in public office over his friendship with Arcuri. But its 112-page report did say Johnson should have declared an interest in Arcuri. And that his failure to do so could have amounted to a breach of the London assembly’s code of conduct. Its director general, Michael Lockwood, said: “We found no evidence to indicate that Mr Johnson influenced the payment of any sponsorship monies to Ms Arcuri or that he influenced or played an active part in securing her participation in trade missions.” But he added: “While there was no evidence that Mr Johnson influenced the payment of sponsorship monies or participation in trade missions, there was evidence to suggest that those officers making decisions about sponsorship monies and attendance on trade missions thought that there was a close relationship between Mr Johnson and Ms Arcuri, and this influenced their decision-making.” Decisions about whether Arcuri should attend the trade mission were discussed with an official in Johnson’s office referred to in the report only as ‘Mr I’ understood to be Johnson’s director of communications Will Walden. The official told the inquiry he was aware of rumours about the closeness Johnson to Arcuri. But he said: “you don’t ask your boss if they’re having an affair.” Mr I also said: “It was raised with me that she didn’t qualify to come [on a trade trip to New York], which was something that I probably should have asked her questions [on] but I never did.” The IOPC noted that Johnson has never publicly accepted he had an affair with Arcuri, but has not denied it either. Arcuri refused to discuss her private life with IOPC but she told them there were “always whispers about me from day one.” The IOPC recommended that the Greater London Authority conduct a review of L&P policies and processes around the payment of sponsorship money. The London assembly said it would resume its investigation after the decision, with Len Duvall, the Greater London Authority’s oversight committee chair, saying: “The IOPC was looking specifically at whether he committed a criminal offence. That’s not our remit and their decision doesn’t have any real bearing on our investigation, which will focus on his conduct as mayor of London.” A spokesman for the prime minister said: “We welcome the fact that this politically motivated complaint has been thrown out. Such vexatious claims of impropriety in office were untrue and unfounded.” Referring to a report that cleared the culture department of any wrongdoing in awarding Arcuri’s company Hacker House an £100,000 grant last year, he added: “An independent review by the government internal audit agency similarly showed the claims made by the Labour party were false. “This was not a policing matter, and we consider this was a waste of police time.” Arcuri has said that she was given no favours by Johnson, but she conceded that the then mayor should have declared their friendship. The IOPC repeatedly insisted that it had been under no pressure from the government over the decision, which was expected before last December’s general election, or over its timing. The IOPC has a duty to investigate any alleged criminal offence committed by a figure in charge of policing, whether or not they are still in office. The IOPC’s view that prime minister does not have a criminal case to answer will come as huge relief to Downing Street. But now the City Hall watchdog will take up scrutiny of the matter. The oversight committee had put its inquiry on hold at the request of the IOPC. Duvall added: “Everyone who holds public office, whether you’re the mayor of London, or indeed the prime minister, is expected to adhere to the principles of public life - including integrity, selflessness, openness and honesty, to name a few. “Our investigation will consider whether Johnson conducted himself in a way that’s expected from anyone in that position. It’s important we get those answers, because Londoners deserve to have their politicians held accountable. “The oversight committee will take into account the current emergency when looking at the timetable for the investigation.” The committee has threatened to use its power to summon Johnson to answer questions as it did over the “garden bridge” fiasco. The oversight committee works to a lower standard of proof than the “beyond reasonable doubt” threshold required for criminal action, but cannot apply any sanction other than a public report."
2020-05-21T08:07:41Z,politics,Politics,Scotland bans Covid-19 support to firms based in tax havens,"The Scottish parliament has voted to block companies based in tax havens from using millions of pounds in coronavirus relief funding, in emergency legislation. MSPs approved measures on Wednesday night brokered by the Scottish Greens to prohibit firms or individuals who are registered in tax havens, or are a subsidiary of an offshore company, from getting support grants. The vote follows similar decisions by the Welsh government last week and by other EU member states, including Denmark and France, but ministers have yet to say how much Scottish government spending will be affected or how it will be enforced. It is thought it could prevent companies with offshore links from applying to a new £120m enterprise resilience fund that provides grants for small- and medium-sized firms, and a £30m creative, tourism and hospitality bailout fund for firms that cannot get business rates relief.
The measures, which were also backed by the Conservatives, were supported by the Scottish National party after ministers asked for them to be restricted to grants instead of including loans after advice from government lawyers. Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green party co-leader, said: “Any company which avoids its responsibility to contribute to society should not be getting handouts when things go wrong. That’s why many European nations and Wales have already made this commitment. “I’m delighted that ministers finally saw sense on this basic issue of fairness. This move isn’t the final word, but it marks the beginning of a new approach to tackling the companies which shamelessly avoid paying tax, and we will continue to build on what’s been achieved today.” In other measures, MSPs were given extra powers to: take over badly run care homes where there was a threat to life; give £19.2m extra for carers; and, in a surprise defeat for the government, extend the life of pop-up cycle lanes and wider pavements to support physical distancing measures. However, the SNP voted with the Tories against measures to freeze rents for two years to protect those on low wages or in arrears during the post-pandemic economic recovery.
Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said the Scottish Green proposals were flawed and could have unintended consequences. The tax haven vote will renew the focus on the Scottish government’s use of offshore companies, which are set up legally in the UK and pay all the taxes they are expected to pay, in other situations. An investigation by the Guardian and the Ferret website in 2018 found that companies based in the Channel Islands, Dubai and the Cayman Islands had substantial stakes in 47 private finance schemes to build Scottish motorways, schools, hospitals and colleges. The analyst Dexter Whitfield found that offshore firms and investors were involved in about 60% of those Scottish government-backed schemes, which will cost £2.7bn to build but will cost taxpayers nearly £8bn in total once the borrowing, interest, management fees and running costs are paid off. The Welsh government blocked companies with headquarters in a tax haven from accessing its £500m economic resilience fund on 15 May. Ministers in Cardiff said last week it would affect a small number of companies. Rebecca Evans, the Welsh finance minister, said: “We have put in place the most generous business support package in the whole of the UK. It is only right that businesses which are not contributing tax payments to our economy should not benefit from this scheme.”"
2020-05-21T06:24:56Z,politics,Politics,Ministers overruled permanent secretaries 11 times during coronavirus pandemic,"Ministers responding to the coronavirus pandemic have on 11 occasions ordered their departments to override formal objections from their most senior civil servant, a report by Whitehall’s spending watchdog has found. In its first assessment of the government’s finances since responses began four months ago, the National Audit Office (NAO) disclosed that permanent secretaries challenged extraordinary spending pledges because they were conducted quickly and without the usual “value for money” checks. Secretaries of state issued ministerial directions to force the spending pledges through and made themselves solely accountable for the decisions, auditors said. There have been only 75 such directions in the past 30 years, according to the Institute for Government. “Ministerial directions have been sought and granted to exceed departmental expenditure limits authorised by parliament for 2019-20 to support urgent spend; and because it had not been possible for departments to carry out as full an appraisal of the value for money of some schemes as would usually be undertaken,” the report said. A report released on Thursday found that the government had pledged more than £124bn in extra spending to tackle the virus and its economic consequences. A week ago, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent body responsible for forecasting the public finances, said the measures would total £123bn, up from £103bn in late April. Auditors found that ministers made more than 500 announcements between 31 January and 4 May on its response to the pandemic. Of the £124.3bn of programmes, initiatives and spending commitments, £111.3bn was for grants and other payments, £5bn for loans, and £8bn for increases to benefits. The figure does not include the loss of receipts to the Treasury worth an estimated £4.4bn, most of which takes the form of deferred tax payments. Among the spending commitments made by the government was £6.6bn for health and social care measures, which was dwarfed by a promise of £82.2bn for businesses. Another £19.5bn was pledged to support individuals through measures such as benefits, and £15.8bn for other public services. Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: “The scale and nature of the Covid-19 pandemic and the government’s response is unprecedented in recent history. This report outlines the range of measures taken by government to date and where financial support has been targeted. “It also forms the basis for a substantial programme of independent reports from the National Audit Office to parliament and the public on how the money has been spent and the lessons learned.” In a separate development, figures released on Wednesday showed the number of people claiming unemployment benefit increased to 2.1 million in April. The rise of 856,500 claims in April reflected the impact of the first full month of lockdown, the Office for National Statistics said."
2020-05-21T05:00:46Z,politics,Politics,No-deal Brexit 'would overwhelm local emergency teams',"Preparing for the impact of a no-deal Brexit later this year would overwhelm local emergency response teams exhausted by the Covid-19 pandemic, a leaked Whitehall report has warned. A review by a committee set up to review the response to coronavirus said failing to seek an extension to Brexit negotiations threatened to “compound Covid-19 with a second UK societal-wide, economic and social, chronic threat”. The government made it clear that it will not seek an extension to the Brexit transition period on 31 December – but the leaked report, published by the Municipal Journal, said this threatened to “overwhelm” local disaster planning capacity.
One respondent said: “We are currently in an unprecedented national emergency that will have health, economic, social and political impacts for years to come. The responder community is exhausted – floods, Novichok, terrorism, Brexit preparations, etc. The last thing we need is a no-deal Brexit. “If we are to do recovery properly we do not have the space to start scaling-up a Brexit response too. This needs to be fed into HM government thinking now. This isn’t pro/anti-Brexit – it is about being sensible for the recovery process and the health and wellbeing of our responders.” Another said: “Dare I mention Brexit and the likely LRF [local resilience forum] role – there is a real danger of LRF burnout.” The 76-page report marked “official/sensitive” was drawn up by the C-19 Foresight group, a cross-government team which supports local resilience forums in England and Wales. The 42 regional LRFs are tasked with planning and responding to major incidents and catastrophic events. The Brexit warnings came out of broader discussions with over 200 local police, fire, NHS and council services around whether LRFs could effectively manage the pandemic if the country was hit by a simultaneous emergency on a large scale, such as major flooding.
One contributor to the review said: “A concurrent emergency of any nature would overwhelm resources, albeit I have no doubt we would endeavour to continue delivering, but at what cost?” Another warned: “This could be a real challenge given the public may expect our ‘typical’ level of response to a major incident yet we may be operating under strict social distancing and PPE [personal protective equipment] requirements - both of which may hinder our ability to provide our usual standards of service in relation to incident response.” There was a widespread feeling that LRFs must be properly funded by the government and could no longer rely on the goodwill of local partners alone. There was frustration that during the current crisis they had been at the back of the queue for key resources. One respondent said: “The NHS are understandably a priority, but other key agencies, particularly those attending deaths in the community (police, fire, medics, funeral directors) have had difficulties in accessing PPE. It’s not just PPE, there has been a critical shortage of body bags, with suppliers providing them at 10 times the normal price.” The review expanded on concerns over the government’s controlling approach and failure to communicate vital Covid-19 information and intelligence to local response teams, which first emerged in a shorter version of the report highlighted by the Guardian last week. It said LRFs felt isolated from national decision-making and were unable to effectively plan their response, adding: “Where there was sharing of data and guidance from central government, the way in which it was managed appeared to create additional confusion.” There was frustration that local emergency teams often only found about government plans when they read about them in the press. One respondent said: “Government needs to actually consult about what is planned, not simply announce something at a press conference and expect it to work the next day.” A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Councils, local resilience forums and other local partners are doing invaluable work in their communities across the country with support from government. They are a highly trusted and valued community which has regular contact with ministers and officials. “We share information from across government along with key data on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with them to understand any pressures they are facing in their important work so they can make the appropriate plans for their local areas. “We left the EU with a deal on 31 January this year. We have worked closely with local resilience forums and local government to ensure a smooth transition and we are well prepared to support them as we look towards the end of the transition period.”"
2020-05-20T18:50:58Z,politics,Politics,Coronavirus test delays ‘could jeopardise UK tracing system’,"The coronavirus test-and-trace system could be jeopardised by delays in obtaining test results, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned, as the government’s scientific advisers prepare to assess its effectiveness. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is expected to grill the test-and-trace boss, Dido Harding, on Thursday amid concerns about whether the system will be robust enough to check the spread of the disease and allow the easing of lockdown measures from 1 June. Hunt, who has repeatedly called for “test, track and isolate” to be implemented, warned that a well-functioning system required test results to be rapidly obtainable. “For test and trace to work, you have to get the test results back quickly, and that will mean ironing out a lot of the problems that currently exist, with people waiting too long for their test results,” he said. The Department of Health and Social Care says 97% of test results are obtained within 48 hours. But health and care providers complain of much longer waits – in some cases a week or more.
A spokesperson for the National Care Forum said this week: “The speed at which test results are returned varies widely. For the majority of testing routes for staff and residents, this is between 24 hours and six days. The NHS Providers chief executive, Chris Hopson, has described testing availability as a “patchwork quilt”, saying it has improved significantly, but some trusts are still reporting delays of five days – or in one case as long as 13 days. Boris Johnson announced on Wednesday that 25,000 contact-tracing staff would be in place by 1 June, when the government hopes to be able to move to the next phase of its reopening plan. “I have great confidence that by 1 June we will have a system that will enable us, help us, very greatly to defeat this disease and move the country forward,” the prime minister said.
But insiders confirmed that the NHSX contact tracing app is not due to be rolled out nationally until early June at the earliest. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had said it would be ready to be deployed in “mid-May”. A team of 50 developers have been working to iron out a range of technical issues, the most important of which is said to be the core algorithm, which will determine who to alert if somebody reports feeling unwell, based on how much time and how physically close nearby people were. They insist they are still wedded to a centralised model in which information about who a person’s phone has been close to is uploaded to a special database. Apple and Google released their alternative, decentralised version on Wednesday, which they said had been taken up by 22 countries on five continents. The two companies also said they were working with the UK, which was described as evaluating a number of alternative models. But NHS sources said they had no plans to change direction for now. Harding, a former chief executive of the telecoms firm TalkTalk, was appointed this month to oversee the app and the tracing system as a whole. She is also the chair of the watchdog NHS Improvement. It is understood that Sage experts have modelled the parameters for an effective test-and-track regime in detail, and the impact it would have on controlling future outbreaks.
No decision is expected to be made by the experts until next week about whether they can recommend a move to phase two of the government’s lockdown lifting plan, under which schools will be encouraged to welcome more pupils, and some non-essential shops will reopen. But the decision is contingent on the availability of robust control measures, including a functioning track-and-trace system. The deputy chief scientific adviser, Angela McLean, said on Tuesday: “Scientists have been clear in our advice that changes to lockdown as we modelled them need a highly effective track, trace and isolate system to be in place.” Sage is also preparing to publish more papers in the next fortnight. The chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, who chairs the committee, is keen to improve transparency around decision-making. Vallance has repeatedly promised that scientific evidence about the safety of reopening schools to more pupils will be published. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, wrote to Hancock on Wednesday urging him to set out more details about how the test and trace system will operate. He questioned whether the 25,000 people hired in recent weeks would be enough.
“We must recruit enough tracers to succeed. We’re pleased the government has accepted our argument that 18,000 tracers were never going to be enough. Experts have suggested 50,000 or more would be most effective,” he said. Ashworth said the government should provide for “widespread, regular community testing”. He called for local directors of public health to be put in charge of the system, which should be “properly integrated with local primary care services” so that GPs can order and carry out tests for their patients. At prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, challenged Johnson over the government’s failure to track the spread of the disease after mid-March. “That’s nearly 10 weeks in a critical period without effective tracing. That’s a huge hole in our defences, isn’t it prime minister?” he said."
2020-05-20T18:07:14Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: official death toll rises by 363 to 35,704 – as it happened","Hereâ€™s a closing summary of the main developments today: Johnson pledges UK-wide coronavirus tracing by 1 June Boris Johnson has pledged to have a UK-wide tracing operation to tackle coronavirus in place by 1 June run by 25,000 contact tracers. His commitment at prime ministerâ€™s questions in the Commons came as the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said there had been no effective tracing in the country for 10 weeks. Johnson said: â€œI have great confidence that by 1 June we will have a system that will enable us, help us very greatly to defeat this disease and move the country forward.â€� Record number of tests conducted A record 177,216 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning. The figures were announced after Johnson restated his ambition to get the daily total up to 200,000 by the end of this month. The figures have often been criticised as misleading. Statistics on the Department of Health and Social Careâ€™s website show that although there were 177,216 tests, only 60,744 individuals actually got tested during this 24-hour period. The figures now also include tests carried out for survey purposes, including antibody tests to see if people have had the disease. These survey tests account for 23,601 of the daily total. UK death toll rises by 363 A further 363 Covid-19 deaths were announced in the UK, taking the total to 35,704. The number of coronavirus patients in hospital in England had fallen below 10,000 for the first time since March. Government wants tourism to resume in July The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, has said the government plans to allow tourism to begin in July. Speaking at the daily Downing Street briefin he said: â€œI would love to get the tourism sector up as quickly as we possibly can. Weâ€™ve set this very ambitious plan to try and get it up and running by the beginning of July. Dowden also announced plans to up a taskforce to help people in the recreation and leisure industries get their sectors back to work again. Bereavement scheme extended The government has bowed to pressure to give families and dependants of migrant NHS support staff who die as a result of contracting coronavirus will be granted indefinite leave to remain. The move follows criticism that care workers, cleaners and porters had been left out of the scheme, which only applied to certain occupations including nurses, biochemists and radiographers. Announcing the move, the home secretary, Priti Patel, said: â€œWe are extending the scheme to NHS support staff and social care workers. We want to ensure families have the support they need and so this will be effective immediately and retrospectively.â€� EU response chief warns of second wave The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments â€“ including the UKâ€™s â€“ on disease control. â€œThe question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,â€� said Dr Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In an interview with the Guardian she added: â€œItâ€™s not the time now to completely relax.â€� Rolls-Royce plans to cut 9,000 jobs The Derby based engineering firm Rolls-Royce has announced plans to cut at least 9,000 jobs â€“ almost a fifth of its workforce, with UK factories set to be hardest hit. Negotiations are beginning with trade unions before any figures for job losses in the UK are agreed but Warren East, the companyâ€™s chief executive, said most of the cuts would be in its civil aerospace business. Demand for aircraft, and the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce, have slumped across the world in large part due to the coronavirus pandemic. Northern Ireland set to track and trace for at least a year Stormontâ€™s health minister, Robin Swann, has announced the contact-tracing programme for Northern Ireland is set to last for at least a year. He said a pilot programme that began at the start of April to track contacts associated with all confirmed cases of Covid-19 would be ramped up to a seven-day operation and would last for at least a year. Five more people were reported to have died of coronavirus in Northern Ireland taking its total to 494. Wales rules out setting â€˜arbitraryâ€™ date for reopening schools The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, has said she will not set an â€œarbitraryâ€� date for when more children will return to school. She said more evidence â€“ and more confidence in the evidence â€“ on Covid-19 was needed before schools would open to more children. Public Health Wales has announced 14 more deaths from coronavirus, taking the total in Wales to 1,238. Sturgeon denies cover-up over early cases Nicola Sturgeon has denied the Scottish government tried to cover up coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February. In angry exchanges at first minister questions, Sturgeon accused the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Jackson Carlaw, of unfairly impugning her integrity and that of health officials by suggesting this early outbreak was hushed up. Last week it revealed that there were multiple transmissions of coronavirus in Edinburgh on 26 and 27 February, well before the first confirmed case in the country on 1 March, but that this was not disclosed to the public. A total of 2,184 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, an increase of 50 since Tuesday. UK universities facing Â£760m hit British universities face a potential Â£760m blow to their funding after about one in five students said they would not enrol in the next academic year if classes were delivered online and other activities curtailed. A survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than 20% said they were willing to delay starting their courses if universities were not operating as normal due to the coronavirus pandemic, which would mean there would be 120,000 fewer students when the academic year begins in autumn. A number of universities including Cambridge have said they will conduct all lectures online throughout the 2020-21 academic year. Outsourcing firm apologises for sharing details of hundreds of contract tracers The outsourcing firm Serco has apologised after accidentally sharing the email addresses of almost 300 contact tracers. The company is training staff to trace cases of Covid-19 for the UK government. It made the error when it emailed new trainees to tell them about training. Serco said it had apologised and would review its processes â€œto make sure that this does not happen againâ€�. Labour said the breach raised serious questions for the government about the capability of Serco to command public confidence. MoD set to scale down size of Covid support force The Ministry of Defence is poised to announce a reduction in the numbers of military personnel ready to tackle the coronavirus crisis in the UK to 7,500 from 20,000. These are soldiers and other members of the armed forces â€œheld at readinessâ€� so they can be deployed quickly if needed by civilian authorities, but with only 4,000 currently being used and the national situation slowly improving it has been decided fewer troops are required on standby."
2020-05-20T17:47:41Z,politics,Politics,Police watchdog to announce decision on Johnson-Arcuri inquiry,"Boris Johnson will find out on Thursday if he faces a criminal investigation into his relationship with an American businesswoman while he was mayor of London. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is to reveal its long-delayed decision on whether to investigate him for possible criminal misconduct over his friendship with Jennifer Arcuri. The watchdog will make the announcement at noon, after spending months on a scoping exercise into whether the prime minister has a case to answer. Johnson was formally referred to the watchdog in September because he was the head of the mayor’s office for policing and crime at a time when Arcuri received public money and access to trade trips led by Johnson when he was mayor. Arcuri was awarded thousands of pounds in public money, including £11,500 by the mayor’s promotional agency, London & Partners. Johnson’s office also intervened to give her a place on trade missions to New York and Tel Aviv with Johnson, after she was initially turned down because she failed to meet the criteria. The IOPC has repeatedly insisted that it has received no pressure from the government over the decision, which had been expected before last December’s general election, or over its timing. The watchdog has a duty to investigate any alleged criminal offence committed by a figure in charge of policing, whether or not they are still in office. That assessment has now concluded almost eight months after it was first referred to the IOPC. Johnson has insisted that he acted with “full propriety” and claimed he had no interest to declare in Arcuri, who has said she was given no favours by Johnson. Arcuri has conceded, however, that the then mayor should have declared their friendship. In response to a freedom of information request, the IOPC said earlier this month that it was still conducting its scoping exercise. In a letter to the social policy and transparency thinktank Society Syndrome, it said: “We are aware of the public interest in this matter and once a decision has been made, we will make a further statement.” It has strenuously denied delaying the decision to spare the prime minister potential embarrassment before the last election. The watchdog is understood to have reached its decision believing that whichever way it goes, it may face a legal challenge, such as a judicial review, from those who disagree with it. If it decides against a criminal investigation, it will not be the end of the matter. A special committee of the Greater London Authority will pick up the allegations, its chair told the Guardian. Len Duvall, chair of the oversight committee and a Labour member of the London assembly, said: “We’ve been waiting for the IOPC to finish. If they come back with a negative conclusion [not to investigate], it comes back to the oversight committee. We will look at the evidence and come to a conclusion.” The oversight committee works to a lower standard of proof than the “beyond reasonable doubt” threshold required for criminal action, but cannot apply any sanction other than a public report. Earlier this year, critics accused the IOPC of dragging its feet over the decision. Siân Berry, the Green party co-leader who is standing as the Greens’ candidate in next year’s mayoral election, said in January: “This has gone on too long.” She added: “They should have made a decision before the general election. When there are big issues about someone’s conduct in public life and they are up for election for the most senior post in the government, there’s no real justification for delay.” Siobhan Benita, the Liberal Democrat candidate for London mayor, said: “It’s already outrageous this whole episode was effectively sat on during the general election when there was sufficient evidence for an investigation to proceed.”"
2020-05-20T17:36:56Z,politics,Politics,What checks will there be on goods crossing Irish Sea?,"The government has finally conceded there will be extra checks and paperwork on some goods trade across the Irish Sea after Brexit. So why, on what, and when will they begin? Why will there be checks? They were agreed by Boris Johnson and the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at a meeting in the Wirral last October. Although controversial and vehemently opposed by the Democratic Unionist party, they were cemented into law when they became part of the withdrawal agreement approved in January by parliament. They were proclaimed as the breakthrough to remove the need for checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which could have risked the continuing peace process. Didn’t Boris Johnson say there would be no checks? Yes. His statements during the election campaign confounded the EU and fuelled fears that the UK would try to wriggle out of the Northern Ireland protocol and push the border back to the land frontier with Ireland. What has changed? Reality has prevailed. The checks were legally agreed and, on Wednesday, Michael Gove confirmed them for the first time in a 23-page document. When will the checks be imposed? From 1 January next year, whether the UK strikes a trade deal with the EU or not. They will hold for at least six years under the withdrawal agreement. What will be the main checks? Checks on all live animals and on agrifood entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain will be conducted in airports and ports. This is to ensure the island of Ireland remains one epidemiological unit, minimising the prospect of disease being “imported” from Britain. Will there be any other checks? There should also be regulatory checks on the standards of goods. This is to ensure no sub-EU standard phones, TVs or toys, for instance, that could be permissible in the UK post-Brexit, enter the European single market (the Republic of Ireland) via Northern Ireland. The UK has said such checks will not be done at the border but in the market with spot checks in shops and warehouses, for example. What about tariffs? The government has said there will be no tariffs on goods entering the region from Britain but remaining in Northern Ireland. It has also said there will be no new customs posts or officials. This is a unilateral interpretation of the Northern Ireland protocol and remains to be discussed in detail with the EU. Anything else? Yes, the government has said there will be no exit or entry declaration forms. These are normally required for trade between EU and third countries and were identified as necessary by the former Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay shortly after the Wirral breakthrough summit. It remains to be seen if the EU will agree. How will it work in practice? Gove has said HMRC will be giving “extensive support” to businesses in the coming week and months and that dedicated teams are in place to work out the IT systems needed for the new VAT, excise and customs regime."
2020-05-20T15:53:22Z,politics,Politics,"This time, Boris is better prepared – but the QC still gets under his skin | John Crace","We haven’t seen much of Boris Johnson over the past week. In fact we haven’t seen him at all; not even for a single Downing Street press conference. Far too much like hard work. He’s even making the notoriously lazy David Cameron look industrious by comparison. And Dave wasn’t prime minister during the worst global health crisis in 100 years. Now, though, things have become a little clearer. In between taking Dilyn for a walk in the park and avoiding changing his baby’s nappies, Boris has been breaking the habit of a lifetime by actually doing some preparation. After two weeks of humiliation at the despatch box during prime minister’s questions, Boris had been taking lessons in how not to appear like a total car crash in front of a top QC.
The message that Boris appeared to have been given was for him to be more himself. The downside to this, though, is that the real Boris is actually rather unpleasant. The popular, fun-loving image has only ever been a veneer. Deep down, Boris is needy and insecure. Character traits that he hates in himself and finds impossible to accept, so his first instinct when cornered is to lash out. So that was the Boris we got at this week’s PMQs. Pugnacious, ungracious, blustering, and not totally coherent. For the extra Tory backbenchers who had been bussed in for the occasion – the party high command feel Boris performs best when there is a home audience – this was an undoubted improvement on what had gone before when only a surly incompetence had been on view. But it was still a long way short of what most people in the country would have wanted from their leader at such a time. Even when he is being himself, Boris just isn’t that good when up against someone like Keir Starmer, who is used to building a case based on the evidence. The Labour leader began on care homes. How did the government square its insistence that it had “thrown a protective ring around care homes” with the evidence given to the health select committee by the chief executive of Care England that countless patients had been booted out of hospital without any testing for the coronavirus?
“As he knows full well, er, the, er, dist … ” Boris began, struggling to complete a meaningful sentence. We never did get to find out what the “dist” was. His language was as much of a mess as his hair. But just as it seemed the prime minister was reverting to one of his other default settings of winging it, he glanced at his notes for a better line of attack. Aha, he said. No one had been released into care homes without a clinician signing them out. Here we got a first view of the government’s defence in the coming public inquiry. The government had never intended the wrong people to be released from hospitals and if they had been, then it was all down to doctor error. In five years’ time it will turn out that all the excess care home deaths were down to one doctor who has also conveniently died of the coronavirus, and nothing to do with any decisions the government had made. There were times during the following exchanges when Starmer appeared rather unsettled by this new bullish, sollipsistic Boris – it was the height of cheek to accuse Starmer of feigning ignorance, when the prime minister was so busy feigning intelligence. At one point Matt Hancock started joining in – “and you bought your mum a £10m donkey sanctuary, so there” – before the Speaker invited him to either shut up or sod off. Matt slumped into a five-year-old’s strop and stared angrily at the ground. Not that Boris appeared particularly grateful for the health secretary’s intervention – he dislikes toadies as much as those who stand up to him – as he promptly threw him under a bus by insisting that the test and trace programme would be fully operational by 1 June. There was no word on whether Matt’s App would also be up and running, but given that the government has missed almost every deadline it has set for itself – and lied about the ones it has met – no one was holding their breath. Boris had yet again set himself and his health secretary up to fail. Although Starmer wasn’t getting things all his own way, there was no doubt he was still getting the better of every argument. There’s something about the poise and command of the Labour leader that seems to get under the prime minister’s skin. As if he knows that he will never come close to having his integrity or intellect. At one point Boris nearly lost it completely by demanding that Keir stop being so negative. How about some applause for the people who hadn’t died? “I’m sorry, but 34,000 dead is negative,” Starmer observed. Especially as the real figure was north of 50,000, many of which were totally avoidable. One could forgive a lot if Boris was even able to come close to an apology, but now he can’t even admit that there is a correlation between an effective test-and-trace system and a further easing of lockdown measures. There again, he can’t bring himself to say how many children he has, so what hope is there? It was with the last two questions that Starmer left Boris hopelessly exposed. How did the government justify the £624 visa surcharge on so many overseas workers who had done so much to keep the NHS running more or less smoothly? Boris merely shrugged. They were a useful source of revenue. Besides, they were lucky to have a job in which some of them could say they had been able to save the life of the prime minister. Put that way, Luis and Jenny should have been thanking him for fleecing them for more cash rather than the other way round. Such is his narcissism, Boris had no idea how petty and spiteful he sounded.
The rest of PMQs was something of a non-event. Boris had clearly come prepared to see off Keir and only had bog-standard, drivel-strewn non-answers for everyone else. He left the chamber with a swagger. Before he had twice lost on a knockout; now he had just been comprehensively outclassed on points. And back in Downing Street, Classic Dom would be telling him that was another overwhelming victory. • This article was amended on 21 May 2020 to correct the figure for the NHS surcharge levied on migrant workers from outside the European Economic Area."
2020-05-20T14:49:46Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Gove confirms plans for checks on goods crossing Irish Sea,"The government has confirmed for the first time that there will be Brexit checks on animals and food goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK from next January. The announcement, detailed in a 23-page document released by the government on Wednesday, comes months after Boris Johnson pledged there would be no checks on trade crossing the Irish Sea – telling businesses that if anyone asked them to fill in new paperwork, they could “throw it in the bin”. Despite that pledge, Michael Gove said on Wednesday the checks would be necessary to ensure the entire island of Ireland maintained “disease-free status”, with border inspection posts for agrifood arrivals at Belfast port, Belfast international airport, Belfast City airport and Warrenpoint port. There would also be “expanded infrastructure” at some of these sites, with Larne port, where checks on live animals are already carried out, designated as the principal port for livestock after Brexit. The arrangements have been put in place as part of the deal struck between Boris Johnson and the EU in January to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. The effort to minimise the checks as set out by Gove will provide reassurance to some business and political leaders opposed to such controls, primarily the Democratic Unionist party, but is likely to spark a fresh row over the Irish border with the EU. One senior EU official expressed satisfaction that the government had U-turned on Johnson’s claims that there would be no additional customs controls on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. “It could be a great deal worse,” the source said of the British proposals. “It is a good first step when you strip away the rhetoric around it.”
According to the statement, there will be no customs fees payable on goods remaining in the region. Neither will there be security certificates for goods going in either direction. These are the so-called exit and entry declaration forms that the former Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay revealed would be needed for goods traded in both directions. Under a four-point plan, Gove pledged: Trade going from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK would “take place as it does now”. Tariffs would not be levied on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. There would be “some limited additional process on goods arriving in Northern Ireland” from Great Britain. Trade to and from Northern Ireland from third countries outside the EU would be handled under the agreements the UK secures for the country as a whole. Gove’s pledge not to apply tariffs on goods transported to Northern Ireland from Great Britain complies with the spirit of the deal struck between Johnson and the EU. But it could set him on a collision course with Brussels, which had envisaged that customs controls would apply to all goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, with rebates on tariffs for goods that did not go on to the Republic of Ireland. Sources say the government has come under pressure from big supermarket chains among other businesses who have argued that if they are delivering consignments to shoppers in Northern Ireland, a tariff-charge and charge-back arrangement would lead to costly and unnecessary paperwork. Gove promised the checks would involve “the minimum possible bureaucratic consequences for business and traders, particularly those carrying out their affairs entirely within the UK customs territory”. The government has said, however, that “some new administrative process” will apply for traders because the deal requires the UK to apply EU customs rules to goods entering Northern Ireland. # The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, welcomed the plan, revealing discussions on agrifood had been “difficult and sensitive”. But she warned the UK deal must ensure it “does not saddle individual Northern Ireland businesses with further costly administrative burdens”. Claire Hanna, the Social Democratic and Labour party MP for Belfast South, said Gove had “finally confirmed there will be a large increase in the amount of red tape” for businesses and warned that “castles in the air” such as trade deals with the US would lead to increased checks in the Irish Sea. Sinn Féin said the checks showed the “forked tongue” approach of the UK government. Discussing the papers in the Commons, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, said: “We welcome the statement today but it does expose the broken promises made by the prime minister ... Even now, many fear that the government are not willing to admit the full extent of those. We have seven months to get this right and we must.” Business leaders also gave the plan a cautious welcome. Seamus Leheny, the policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland, said it was a “positive step that the UK confirms there will be some controls”, but that the language was so “loose” in areas that it was effectively putting the ball back in the EU’s court. Aodhán Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said it was a good start but questions remained. “The UK government has acknowledged the need to deliver upon their obligations under the Northern Ireland protocol. This acceptance of the hurdles that need to be overcome is a good starting point, but there are still many questions that are left unanswered.” An EU spokesman said the commission welcomed the proposal and would study it in detail. “We have said we can provide certain flexibilities in terms of customs checks, but they have to fit with the union’s customs code, because the Irish border is the EU border, so the union customs code applies,” a second EU official said. The document emerged as the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier warned the government that the next round of negotiations on the future relationship must bring “new dynamism in order to avoid a stalemate”. He was responding to a letter from his UK counterpart David Frost , who accused Brussels of treating the UK as an “unworthy” partner. Frost’s letter went down badly in Brussels, where EU officials said it would have been better to save such conversations for the privacy of negotiations. In a pointed criticism made in his own reply - by letter - Barnier said an exchange of letters was “not necessarily the best way to discuss on substantial points”. One EU diplomat said Frost’s letter was “petulant” and “not helpful”, although added some of Barnier’s comments were “not very helpful either”, referring to Barnier’s recent remarks where he accused the UK of not engaging in the talks. “We would agree with [Barnier] in substance but we don’t necessarily think that the tone of these comments has been very helpful,” the diplomat said."
2020-05-20T14:42:54Z,politics,Politics,"Commons return will ‘euthanise’ MPs, Jacob Rees-Mogg is warned","Jacob Rees-Mogg has been told by a senior Conservative backbencher that an attempt to return to a “physical” parliament will in effect “euthanise” MPs who are sick, shielding and self-isolating. After the leader of the house confirmed the government planned to end the virtual parliamentary proceedings and force MPs to return to Westminster in early June, the former minister Robert Halfon said the proposals would discriminate and threaten the lives of some MPs. “Is it really morally just to say in effect to MPs, because you are not Tarzan-like and able to swing through the chamber, beating your chest shouting to your constituents: ‘Look, I am here!’ that you are effectively euthanised from the Commons? “MPs who are disrupted by this awful pandemic are not just old horses to be sent to the knackers’ yard,” he said. Parliament is due to go into recess for two weeks for the Whitsun holiday on Wednesday. Since the coronavirus lockdown was introduced in mid-March, members have been encouraged to work virtually, with only 50 MPs in the chamber being treated the same as up to 120 MPs appearing virtually. MPs have only been called to speak if listed. Rees-Mogg said if schools and other businesses were reopening on 1 June, MPs should too when the Commons returns the day after. “We have to recognise that if we persist with the present arrangement it will become harder to make progress in a timely fashion,” he said. “That is why, in line with government advice for those who cannot do their jobs from home, I am asking members to return to their place of work after Whitsun,” he said. Opposition MPs failed in an attempt to take control of the Commons agenda to enable a vote on how the chamber operates after the Whitsun recess. Their amendment to the Wednesday timetable motion was not selected, although they continued to raise their opposition. The Liberal Democrat Alistair Carmichael, who represents Orkney and Shetland, said he found the virtual arrangements “stilted and artificial”, but added: “If it’s a choice between that and putting the safety of members, their families and staff of the house at risk, then that is no choice at all and it should only end when safe to do so.” He said it has been reported the motivation for the MPs’ return is to “get a support act” behind Boris Johnson at prime minister’s questions. Opposition MPs forced a vote on the original timetable motion but it was approved by 350 votes to 258. Karen Bradley, the Conservative chair of the procedure committee, said the Commons “needs to be in agreement” with the way it conducts business and asked Rees-Mogg to “reflect” on the issue. Some MPs wrote on Wednesday to the Speaker saying Rees-Mogg’s proposals could create a two-tier House of Commons. A letter signed by 35 MPs, including the Conservative chair of the women and equalities select committee, Caroline Nokes, and the Labour MP Stella Creasy, argued that a return to a “physical” parliament could mean that those in high-risk categories including BAME MPs, older MPs or those who are pregnant will be disproportionately restricted.
“As social distancing measures are reduced in a phased manner this summer, we are concerned that there is a risk of creating two tiers of MPs: those who are able to attend and those who mostly cannot given the ongoing challenges of lockdown and their own personal circumstances. “Given what is known about the nature of this virus, and who is a high risk, it is likely that this will mean those MPs who are BAME MPs, older MPs or who are pregnant will be disproportionately restricted,” the letter says.
Rees-Mogg has agreed that MPs’ staff and parliamentary workers can continue to work from home, amid concerns they would be put at risk, following a meeting of the Commons commission on Tuesday. Unions expressed their concern about Rees-Mogg’s proposals. Garry Graham, the Prospect deputy general secretary, said: “It is incredibly disappointing that the government has chosen to ignore the voice of staff and impose a full return to parliament in two weeks, including physical voting, that will mean hundreds of people packed into parliament’s narrow corridors putting MPs and staff at risk.” ."
2020-05-20T12:37:22Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson pledges UK-wide coronavirus tracing by 1 June,"Boris Johnson has pledged to have a UK-wide tracing operation to tackle coronavirus in place by 1 June run by 25,000 contact tracers. His commitment at prime minister’s questions in the Commons came as the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said there had been no effective tracing in the country for 10 weeks. Johnson said: “I have great confidence that by 1 June we will have a system that will enable us, help us, very greatly to defeat this disease and move the country forward.” Johnson also said the controversial NHS surcharge for staff from outside the European Economic Area who work in healthcare would remain in place, explaining that despite giving it some thought he believed it was important because of the money it made for the NHS. The fee is due to rise from £400 to £624 in October, although doctors, nurses and paramedics are exempt from the payment for a year. Care workers are not included in the exemption.
Starmer said there had been no effective tracing system in place since 12 March, when the government decided to drop the strategy, unlike in Germany and South Korea, which have had much lower death rates. “That’s nearly 10 weeks in a critical period without effective tracing. That’s a huge hole in our defences, isn’t it prime minister?” Starmer asked. Johnson said during the exchange that he had growing confidence that England would have a test, track and trace operation that would be “world-beating” by 1 June. “There will be 25,000 trackers. They will be able to cope with 10,000 new cases a day. “That’s very, very important because currently new cases are running at 2,500 a day. They will be able to trace the contacts for those new cases and to stop the disease spreading,” Johnson said. Despite the social distancing in the chamber, it was a more rowdy PMQs than in recent weeks. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, frustrated the Speaker, who warned him to “stop advising the opposition” or leave the chamber. He had been heckling Starmer from behind the prime minister. Labour is calling for the government to drop the NHS surcharge for all health and care workers indefinitely and is due to table an amendment to the immigration bill to exempt them from the charge.
Starmer asked the prime minister if he thought it was right that care workers coming from abroad working on the frontline should pay a surcharge to use the NHS themselves. Johnson said: “I’ve thought a great deal about this. I do accept and I do understand the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff. I’ve been the personal beneficiary of carers who come from abroad and, frankly, saved my life … so I know exactly the importance. “On the other hand we must look at the realities. This is a great national service, it’s a national institution. It needs funding and those contributions actually help us to raise about £900m and it’s very difficult in the current circumstances to find alternative sources. “With great respect to the point he makes, I do think that that is the right way.” Johnson was recently treated in intensive care for coronavirus by a nurse from New Zealand, whose citizens have to pay the surcharge if they come to work in the UK."
2020-05-20T09:29:26Z,politics,Politics,Petition calls for key workers to be exempt from London congestion charge,"The government and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, are being urged to exempt key workers from the reimposed and increased congestion charge amid warnings it will penalise those serving the public during the pandemic. An £11.50 daily charge was reintroduced this week as a condition of a £1.6bn government bailout for Transport for London (TfL).
As part of the deal the cost will rise to £15 from 22 June. The charge, which had been suspended during lockdown, will also be extended from weekdays to the whole week and for longer hours. Critics say the plan runs counter to pleas by ministers for commuters to use cars if they can to relieve pressure on the transport network. NHS and care home workers will be be entitled to a refund if their employers are based in central London. A TfL spokesman said: “The rationale for the exemption is a recognition of the essential role they are playing in responding to coronavirus, and the fact that they could come into close contact with a large number of people who have coronavirus, and could infect people they come into contact with.” But he confirmed all other workers including teachers, police officers, firefighters, and transport workers would have to pay the increase charges in full. The Metropolitan Police Federation chairman, Ken Marsh, said officers should not be “penalised” for trying to keep London safe. “Since the beginning of this pandemic, police officers in London have worked tirelessly to keep the public safe at no little risk to themselves,” he said. “To be told that they now have to pay the congestion charge when other key workers retain an exemption is a slap in the face to our brave colleagues. At a time when we are being discouraged from using public transport to get to our places of work, this seems to go completely against government guidelines.” More than 3,000 people have signed a petition calling for a full exemption for all key workers. The petition, by Lee Steery, an emergency worker from Thurrock in Essex who works outside the NHS, said the changes would “cost thousands of hard-working people who need to drive into London for work, hundreds, possibly thousands of pounds, a year extra”. He added: “This will affect key workers, who will be the ones impacted the most due to being shift workers, unable to use public transport at all hours, with no other means of transport, who are the people keeping the currently moving during this pandemic. “I, like thousands who work for the emergency services, will find it impossible to get to and from work from currently paying barely anything a month in congestion charge to potentially having to pay £75 per five-day working week.”
Lisa Elliott, the Royal College of Nursing’s London director, said: “No one should be financially penalised for working to keep people safe. With 70% of London’s nursing staff living and working in different boroughs, it is only right that nursing staff should exempt from the congestion charge. RCN London are clear that this [exemption] must be a permanent measure.” The former Labour minister Dame Joan Ruddock tweeted that the new charge was a “kick in the teeth” for low-paid key workers. She also claimed the conditions imposed on the bailout were designed to discredit Khan.
One commuter, Kath Stirling, told London’s deputy mayor for transport, Heidi Alexander, it would cost key workers an extra £57.50 a week for following official advice to travel by car.
Another asked Boris Johnson: “How are we meant to maintain social distancing when you … @SadiqKhan are reinstating the congestion charge forcing us all back onto public transport.” The GMB union, whose members includes couriers, and bus and minicab drivers, said it had “legions” of emails and calls from members worried about costs that could put some of them out of business. Steve Garelick, its London regional organiser, said: “Those who are carrying out private hire work are now seeing a further increase in the cost of work during an incredibly austere period. They have got to find a way of covering this extra costat a time when there is little or no work. Private-hire drivers feel like they have been sold down the river. Thousands of people feel hurt and angry about this. “If you are a courier having to deliver into central London, you’re suddenly having to pay a congestion charge, which is taking money off your bottom line. The government needs to put a halt to this until we have come out of the crisis, and then reconsider how and who pays for such a charge.”
Joseph Onyegbule, a private-hire driver, said: “The increase of the £15 congestion charge is more than any of us can bear. I am already having to work a minimum of 14 hours a day.” He fears the fee increase, which will cost him an extra £6,000 per year, will force him out of business. He pointed out that for a typical fare to central London he would make £8 or £9, but it would now cost him £11.50 and from next month £15. “I’ll be working below the minimum wage and I’ve got a mortgage to pay,” he said. • Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"
2020-05-19T23:01:10Z,politics,Politics,UK government's new counter-terrorism bill: the key measures,"The government has unveiled a new counter-terrorism bill. Here are some of the key measures to be introduced in the legislation: New sentencing regime Terrorism offenders will be sentenced under the following terms: A life sentence – where the offender spends a minimum period or “tariff” before being considered for release by the Parole Board. The offender may never be released. If released, offenders will spend the rest of their life on licence and can be recalled to custody. Serious terrorist sentence – a new term for the most dangerous offenders, where there is a likelihood of multiple deaths, which carries a minimum 14-year sentence with an extended licence period of seven to 25 years. An extended determinate sentence (EDS) – if this is handed out when the offence carries the maximum penalty of life, the offender will be required to spend their entire sentence behind bars with no prospect of early release. For other offences, someone given an EDS faces an extended licence period after release of up to 10 years. A sentence for offenders of particular concern (SOPC) – for adult or youth offenders, under which they would spend two-thirds of their sentence in custody before being able to apply to the Parole Board for release. Following release they will have a mandatory licence period of 12 months. Longer sentences The bill increases the maximum penalty from 10 to 14 years for a number of terrorism offences, including membership of a proscribed organisation, supporting a proscribed organisation and attending a place used for terrorist training. Longer licence periods Offenders will spend longer under supervision in the community, with a minimum period of 12 months on licence for all terrorism offenders, and adult offenders on parole will be required to take polygraphs, or lie detector tests. Tougher tools for monitoring suspects The bill expands and toughens the power of terrorism prevention and investigation measures (Tpims) by lowering the standard of proof for imposing the measure, removing the maximum length they can last and adding extra measures."
2020-05-19T23:01:10Z,politics,Politics,Unconvicted terrorism suspects face indefinite controls under UK bill,"Terrorism suspects who have not been convicted of any offence face expanded and potentially never-ending measures to control their lives under proposed counter-terrorism laws unveiled by the UK government. Ministers want to weaken the burden of proof for terrorism prevention and investigation measures (Tpims) to be imposed on people suspected of terrorist activityand remove the two-year cap on their use.
Tpims are controversial and resource-heavy measures – usually based on secret intelligence – for controlling the risk presented by terrorism suspects at large where criminal prosecution is not an option. Civil liberties campaigners said the changes posed “a threat to fundamental pillars of our justice system”. The Home Office said the proposals “support the use” of Tpims, which would continue to be used only when “necessary and proportionate”, but would not comment on whether the proposals would lead to an increase in their use. The changes to Tpims come under the counter-terrorism and sentencing bill, which includes a new “serious terrorism sentence” with a 14-year minimum jail term and up to 25 years on licence for the most dangerous offences, broadly defined as featuring a likelihood of multiple deaths. The bill scraps the statutory deadline for the independent review of Prevent, the government’s divisive anti-radicalisation programme, in a move likely to anger human rights campaigners.
And the legislation will allow judges to consider if any serious offence is terror-related, such as an offence involving firearms where there is a proven terrorist link, and allow tougher sentences to be imposed. The legislation builds on the response to terrorist attacks in the last 12 months – at Fishmongers’ Hall in the City of London and Streatham High Road in the south-west of the capital – which led to the ending of automatic release at the midway point of a term for terrorist offenders jailed under standard determinate sentences. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said: “The shocking attacks at Fishmongers’ Hall and Streatham revealed serious flaws in the way terrorist offenders are dealt with. We promised to act and today we are delivering on that promise. Those who senselessly seek to damage and destroy lives need to know we will do whatever it takes to stop them.” As well as lowering the standard of proof for suspected terrorist activity from “balance of probabilities” to “reasonable grounds”, the bill will introduce additional measures that can be used to control subjects.
There are already 14 measures that can be imposed, including overnight residence requirements, relocation to another part of the UK, police reporting, an electronic monitoring tag, exclusion from specific places, limits on association, limits on the use of financial services, and use of telephones and computers, and a ban on holding travel documents. New measures may include requirements for mandatory drug-testing and attendance of drug-treatment programmes, as well as accounting for all electronic devices in a household, not just their own. Breach of any Tpim measure is a criminal offence and can be punished with a prison term. The maximum length for which a Tpim can be imposed is currently two years but the bill will remove this limit so it can be renewed indefinitely. Jonathan Hall QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said he was uncomfortable with the “big changes” to Tpims. “I think what parliament will want to consider is: what is the operational case for these changes?” he said. “I’m going to release some technical analysis of the changes over the coming days, but overall, I am uncomfortable with getting rid of protections for individual rights that don’t appear to have caused any real problems for the authorities to date.” Rosalind Comyn, Liberty’s policy and campaigns officer, said the proposed changes to Tpims would see the return in all but name of control orders, the more restrictive predecessor that was abolished by the coalition government. She said: “Control orders allow people to be placed on indefinite house arrest without trial and this can happen based on suspicion rather than charges, evidence and proof. Control orders were abolished by the coalition government as a stain on our human rights record and that’s where they should remain. “This bill also threatens our safety. Without an evidence-based approach, the government is failing to address the root causes of these incidents and therefore failing to stop them. The fact this bill is being issued during a pandemic, when parliament is not operating at full capacity or able to deliver normal levels of scrutiny, should be a cause of concern for all who care about the future of our democracy and justice.” The legislation will end early release for terrorism offenders who receive a specific type of jail term, known as an extended determinate sentence, where the maximum penalty was life, and force them to serve their whole term in jail. The bill will also increase the maximum penalty from 10 to 14 years for a number of terror offences, including membership of a proscribed organisation, supporting a proscribed organisation and attending a place used for terrorist training. Rachel Logan, Amnesty International UK’s legal expert, said: “It was never right to drastically curtail people’s liberty on the basis of secret, untested evidence using control orders or Tpims – and we seem to be diving headlong into that territory where the standard of proof is extremely flimsy and people’s liberties can be curtailed on an indefinite basis. “Rushing this bill out while parliament is still operating under Covid-19 constraints suggests the government could be trying to minimise scrutiny for significant legal changes. We’ll scrutinise the bill in full as soon as possible, and we’ll be urging the government to adhere to the tried and tested principle that people reasonably suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activities should – if the evidence is there – be prosecuted in a court of law.”"
2020-05-19T21:00:08Z,politics,Politics,TUC boss calls for new council to build fairer economy after Covid-19,"The leader of the Trades Union Congress has declared “the state is back” as the UK’s biggest unions urged the government to form a national recovery council in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The TUC, which represents 48 unions in England and Wales, has called in a report for the establishment of the body, which it argues would bring together government, unions and employers to create a greener and fairer economy. In an interview with the Guardian, the TUC general secretary said there could be no return to business as usual after the pandemic. “We’ve got to get that safety net strung again, we’ve got to invest in our public services, which may have to build resilience for a long time to come,” Frances O’Grady said. “Unions are back … but the state is back too.” Launching the report alongside the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, on Wednesday, the TUC is calling for a return of the unity shown in the years after the second world war, arguing that the post-conflict decade of social investment created growth of 3.3%, but a decade of austerity after the banking crash resulted in growth of 1.9%. “This can’t be about working people paying the price again,” said O’Grady. “I think there is a real sense that this has got to be a people’s effort. It can’t just be left to employers or politicians, we’ve got to step up too.” The TUC, which represents 5.5 million members, is also calling for an overhaul of the UK’s business model – which it argues is based on low-paid, insecure jobs and the exclusion of workers from decision-making. It has called for an increase in the minimum wage to £10 an hour, a public sector pay rise, a ban on zero-hours contracts and a job guarantee scheme – particularly for young people facing a bleak future.
In the far-reaching document the TUC argues that systems for trade and finance damage the interests of poorer countries and drive unfair pay, and calls for changes to international rules and institutions, as well as a plan to tackle discrimination faced by black and minority ethnic people, women and disabled people. It praises the government’s “constructive” work with unions on the creation of the job retention scheme, adding that the ability of local authorities to take homeless people off the street, the emergence of mutual support groups and the adaptability of the workforce, as well as government interventions, “show the speed and scale of what can be done when it is necessary”. It adds that the same commitment and urgency must be applied to tackling the climate emergency. “We’ve run out of excuses about creating a carbon-free economy,” said O’Grady. Industry bailouts and any state investment in the next few months must come with an “Olympics-style plan” for jobs and a minimum requirement for the use of UK products and services to rebuild UK manufacturing, says the report. With unemployment levels set to increase dramatically, it argues jobless people should be given a “funded individual learning account” to learn new skills, with the promise of a job at the end of training. “We’ve got to build back brick by brick, but it has to be fair, decent rewards, fair taxes – all of that has got to be back on the agenda,” said O’Grady. “I think the centre of gravity has shifted and people are remembering why equality matters.”"
2020-05-19T21:00:08Z,politics,Politics,Frances O’Grady: 'this crisis has made us question everything',"Boris Johnson has made much of being at the helm of a supposed “wartime” government during the coronavirus crisis. The enemy is deadly, he tells us, and we have all been enlisted in the fight.
Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, has had enough of the bombast. “But if we’re using war analogies,” she says, “there have been times during this crisis which have had the feeling of the first world war, with the army generals camped hundreds of miles from the front line ordering troops over the top.” In O’Grady’s view, it is the collaboration and progressive spirit of the post-1945 years that provides a better model. To that end, on Wednesday, alongside the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, she will call for a “national recovery council” of unions, government and business. The next few years must see an increase in the minimum wage, a ban on zero-hours contracts and a job guarantee scheme – particularly for young people facing a bleak future, she says. “The big challenge is what happens next and it’s important to have representatives of the workforce at the table to figure that out,” says O’Grady, speaking exclusively to the Guardian. “We can be architects, I think, of the next stage.” This has been an extraordinary time for the TUC, which since the crisis struck has collaborated with the government to an extent unimaginable a few months ago. But with teaching unions in a deadlock with ministers over the proposed limited return to schools at the start of June and employees who can’t work from home already told to return to their workplaces, does she worry unions could be used as a scapegoat for the UK’s stilted exit from lockdown? “I think the public trusts us and our members trust us,” she says. “Our first duty of care is to working people, and there is nothing more fundamental than people staying healthy and safe.” O’Grady is insistent that “there can be no going back to business as usual” when the crisis passes and the fallout begins. Cuts to the welfare state and public services over a decade of austerity left the UK unable to deal with the seismic shock of a global pandemic, she argues. Black people in England and Wales are more than four times as likely to die of coronavirus, with poverty and health inequality mooted as possible reasons. “We now know the real price of inequality,” says O’Grady. “This time working people can’t pay the price for recovery. People will not put up with that. I think the big issue is how do we grow our way out of this and what kinds of industries and jobs will help us do that.” Rebuilding will require investment, not cuts – and that will have to mean fairer taxes, she adds. “We’ve got to get that safety net strung again, we’ve got to invest in our public services, which may have to build resilience for a long time to come,” she says. “Unions are back … but the state is back too.” The need for “a healthy, secure and green economy” with quality skilled jobs is “not a pipe dream, it’s a necessity,” she says. “We have built hospitals in days, have had to radically transform the way we live and work within days. I think we’ve run out of excuses about creating a carbon-free economy.”
In practice that will mean building domestic supply chains, expanding renewable power, manufacturing batteries for electric cars, she says. If critical industries like aviation need bailing out, there must be strings attached. As firms slash entry level jobs by a quarter , job guarantee schemes – “proper ones, not Mickey Mouse schemes” – particularly for young people, will have to be put in place. It should mean, she adds, an increase in the minimum wage to £10 an hour, plus an end to zero-hours contracts and “false” self-employment where workers have no rights. TUC analysis shows women make up three-quarters of key workers, who are worse paid, on average, than those in other sectors (four in 10 key workers earn less than £10 an hour, compared to three in 10 non key workers). In social care – where one in four workers are on zero-hours contracts – that figure rises to seven. “These are people doing some of the most valuable work in society for the least money, who are still even today wrapping themselves in bin bags because of a lack of PPE,” says O’Grady. “What does that say about us?” O’Grady is not a tub-thumper. But asked to rate the government’s performance so far she is quietly damning. “I think there have been a string of failures,” she says. “We were late on lockdown, late on mass testing [and] PPE. We’ve got the highest number of deaths in Europe. This was not a success and they’ve got to learn lessons.” There is still no plan for the mass provision of PPE for a workforce, a significant proportion of whom have already been sent back to work. “It is going to have to happen fast or it will slow the recovery down quite badly because safety must come first,” she says. “It is possible to rebuild and to be safe. I don’t think it’s too much to ask to protect livelihoods and lives.” O’Grady says the prime minister was “clearly irresponsible” to tell those who could not work from home to return to their workplaces without a clear plan in place. There was a worry among unions and business leaders in the week leading up to 10 May, that he might make a “cavalier unilateral announcement,” she says, but there was still shock when it appeared that people had been told to go back to work with 12-hours notice.
“I can only assume that this was an attempt to appease the laissez faire advocates on his backbenches and no doubt in cabinet too,” she says. “But it was counterproductive and backfired big time. “It would be bad enough to gamble with the safety of any particular group of workers – but this is actually about public health. If it winds up with a group of workers unnecessarily exposed to the risk of infection, the likelihood is that it will spread to public transport workers, families and communities. You know, I really hope that [decision] hasn’t jeopardised people’s health.” The TUC were critical of draft post-lockdown workplace rules, and after weeks of intense negotiations with business secretary Alok Sharma, civil servants and business leaders – although not the prime minister himself – O’Grady broke ranks, saying there were “huge gaps” over protective kit and testing. There have since been significant improvements, she says. Companies have been told to publish risk assessments, the Health and Safety Executive has been given a £14m funding boost while employers have been told they are responsible for providing PPE if physical distancing is not possible. But there is a long road ahead. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has publicly rejected a return to austerity, telling parliament that the government’s “levelling-up” agenda would take priority. O’Grady insists unions want to work with the government, and have demonstrated they are constructive and useful, but asks those at the top to show some humility and accept that they might not have all the answers. “This crisis has made us question everything,” she says. “It’s shown that we are going to look after our families, but we want to look after our neighbours too. We have to shift the balance of power. It can’t just be a case of the boardroom says, and everybody else does. I think we’ve learned [that] social solidarity matters.”"
2020-05-19T18:27:21Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: George Eustice urges furloughed workers to pick fruit; death toll rises by 545 – as it happened,"UK Covid-19 death toll riseS by 545 to 35,341, according to latest figures Speaking at Downing Streetâ€™s daily press conference, the environment secretary, George Eustice, urged Britons to apply for jobs as fruit pickers to compensate for the fact that only a third of the eastern Europeans who normally come to the UK to do this work are expected to arrive. The UK is facing a â€œsevere recession the likes of which we havenâ€™t seenâ€�, says Rishi Sunak Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee earlier today, the chancellor said that by the end of the year he expected the percentage of the population in unemployment to be in double figures. It is not obvious that there will be an immediate bounce back, he added. â€œWe are likely to face a severe recession, the likes of which we havenâ€™t seen, and of course that will have an impact on employment,â€� he said. Number of people claiming unemployment benefits surged in April as lockdown hit economy, figures show The UK claimant count jumped by 69% during the month, as 856,000 more people received universal credit and jobseekerâ€™s allowance benefits in April. That lifted the claimant count to nearly 2.1 million people, from 1.24 million in March. In the south-west, the claimant count almost doubled during the month. Meanwhile, more than 2m households have applied for universal credit, the UKâ€™s main social security benefit, since the coronavirus lockdown started to hit the economy in mid-March, according to the latest figures from the Department for Work and Pensions. Excess deaths in UK reached almost 55,000 in early May, according to Office for National Statistics Nick Stripe, the head of the health analysis and life events division at the ONS, told the BBC the total number of excess deaths in the UK - the number above what might be expected at this time of year, judged by a five-year average â€“ was just under 55,000 by early May. Scientists, and ministers, have repeatedly said that the excess death figures will ultimately prove the most reliable guide as to how badly the UK has been hit by coronavirus. Three Premier League football clubs hit by positive Covid-19 tests before top-flight return Half a dozen people from three Premier League football clubs have tested positive for Covid-19 in two days. With hopes of top-flight football resuming next month, the Premier League announced six players or staff returned positive results in its first two days of testing. Health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, pressed over governmentâ€™s â€˜slowâ€™ handling of impact of pandemic in care homes Facing an urgent question from the shadow minister for social care, Liz Kendall, Hancock defended the governmentâ€™s approach, saying deaths in care homes were falling. Kendall highlighted that more than 23,000 more people had died in care homes in the first four months of this year compared with last, accusing ministers of being â€œtoo slowâ€� to tackle the impact of the virus in social care. Commons science and technology committee criticises government for â€˜inadequateâ€™ coronavirus testing capacity throughout pandemic The group of MPs identified several lessons to learn from the UKâ€™s handling of the outbreak, and criticised a lack of transparency over some crucial decision-making. They called on the government to â€œurgentlyâ€� build up capacity for contact tracing, a key tactic in helping ease existing lockdown measures."
2020-05-19T17:45:11Z,politics,Politics,Labour to move autumn conference online amid pandemic,"Labour’s annual autumn conference in Liverpool has been cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak, with an online event planned to replace it. The party conference, which would have been the first with Sir Keir Starmer as leader, was to be held at the ACC convention venue in mid-September. The Liberal Democrats are also expected to replace their conference with a virtual version. A Labour spokesperson said: “Our priority is the safety of members, staff and visitors to our events and the need to protect the public’s health. In light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, we have therefore decided to postpone this year’s annual and women’s conferences.” Plans for the online conference would be released at a later date, the party said. The decision was made by members of Labour’s national executive committee during an online meeting on Tuesday.
Members had told the Guardian they were anticipating friction between Starmer’s supporters and those loyal to his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, on the party’s left. One Labour source said Starmer had a lot to lose if the conference did not take place. “It’s the first time for him to rally and show he’s the members’ choice,” they said. “It’s also a place where there’s things that could revive [unsuccessful deputy leader candidate] Richard Burgon … all those leftwing events. With no conference there’s fewer opportunities for the socialist campaign group. You’d also have the media looking for disgruntled members asking: ‘What does the new leader stand for?’” One MP said cancelling the conference meant a loss of income for the party and a missed “opportunity for our new leader and shadow cabinet to present a fresh start to the country”. The Conservatives say planning for their conference is still under way but is being regularly reviewed. A report by the Lib Dem federal conference committee to be presented to the party’s board suggests the event in Brighton from 26-29 September be cancelled and plans made for an online format instead. The pandemic has thrown the annual political fixtures, which attract thousands of people, into doubt owing to the current ban on mass gatherings and suggestions from the government to prepare for physical distancing to be in place for some time.
The Lib Dems have investigated various software packages to make a virtual conference work. Current advice to members is to not book accommodation or transport for the event, and registration is closed. As well as being a focal point for developing policy with rounds of voting and speeches by senior party members, the Lib Dem conference hosts niche events, such as its popular Glee Club, and generates between £400,000 and £500,000 a year. A Conservative party spokesperson said its event, scheduled for 4-7 October at the Birmingham International Convention Centre, was still going ahead. “At present, planning for the party conference is continuing. We will keep this under review in light of the outbreak of coronavirus. Any decisions taken will be guided by the latest science and medical advice and government guidance,” the spokesperson said."

Head meet sand. What contact tracing app that was supposed to be the key to ending lockdown? Oh that one! We never meant to imply it was that important. Or that it would necessarily be ready when we said it would. Rather it was just an adjunct to some other measures that we haven’t yet thought of. So we are in a game of musical chairs for the morally bankrupt. Which means that Michael Gove is in with a definite chance of winning. Gove is the ultimate shapeshifter. The politician who, more than any other, bends reality to suit his needs. Tonight, Matthew, he will be whoever he wants to be. All failures and shortcomings rewritten as outstanding successes. His two attempts to become party leader? Massive triumphs. Listening to the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster – there is no Brexit secretary any more – answer an urgent question on the third round of Brexit talks that had ended in deadlock you would have had no idea the UK was in the middle of the biggest public health crisis for a century. Or that the economy was contracting by the day and that there were now 10 million people on the furlough scheme, many of whom could be out of a job within months. Rather it was as if the clock had been rewound six months to the Brexit culture wars of late 2019. There wasn’t even a nod to the fact that it might be prudent to even consider the idea of extending transition by a short period, just to see what kind of state both the UK and the EU might be in come December. And whether we might cooperate with one another. Rather, we were fighting an ideological war in which everything Brussels did or said was bad and independence day couldn’t come soon enough. How dare the EU insist on making the demands it had always said it would make and had been largely agreed in the political declaration of the withdrawal agreement? And how dare Brussels demand we keep a level playing field on standards, hygiene and workers’ rights when ours were already far higher than the EU’s? Apart from the ones we were were going to lower to get a free trade agreement with the US. Labour’s Rachel Reeves did try to talk Mikey down. Though appealing to his reason is never the best tactic, as the Govester isn’t strong on rationality. She rightly observed that seven months wasn’t long to try to iron out all the remaining details – the cabinet can’t even agree among itself whether customs and border checks will be needed between Great Britain and Northern Ireland – and that adding to the uncertainty in such uncertain times was potentially catastrophic. Gove had no answer other than to accuse Labour of having no clear plan and that he was sticking to his own regardless. Get Brexit Done. Which had been rather Reeves’s point all along. That not having a clear Brexit plan and hedging your bets over the length of transition was the only sensible option under the circumstances. In the end the Speaker had to interrupt Mikey mid-rant but Gove continued in much the same vein for the rest of the half-hour session. Why were people so obsessed with the coronavirus? It was just an EU plot to thwart Brexit. The people had voted for Brexit and that was what they were going to get. Regardless of how many people had to die or lose their jobs in the process. As if to reinforce the idea that the government was fed up with everyone going on about the coronavirus – what was the big deal about 50,000 deaths and the disappearance from public view of Boris Johnson? – the environment minister, George Eustice, was sent out to take the Downing Street press conference. Because no one is more likely to make people reach for the off button than the most forgettable of cabinet ministers. More so even than Thérèse Coffey, who at least has some unintended comedy value. Earlier in the day she had unwittingly told the BBC that there were plenty of unfilled jobs. I guess she had the Cabinet in mind. Eustice did the prime minister proud by giving a masterclass in banality. He had come with nothing to say and was determined to make sure he said it. So he raced through the same slides that have been shown at every other press conference, before lamenting there were no foreigners to pick soft fruit these days – who would have guessed? – and begging Brits on furlough to support the national effort. It still hasn’t dawned on the government that EU workers were quite handy for doing the low-paid work Brits couldn’t be bothered to do. Within minutes the minister had put almost his entire audience to sleep. That meant few heard him saying it had been a brilliant idea to stop testing and tracing in March because it made the current levels of testing look all the more impressive. And it had been absolutely right to fill care homes with residents who hadn’t been tested because zzzzzzzzz take back control zzzzzzz making our own laws zzzzzzzz and they would have died sooner or later anyway zzzzzzzz. Come the end, I couldn’t even be sure if Eustice was still awake. Another day had passed in which no one had taken responsibility for anything."
2020-05-19T17:27:25Z,politics,Politics,Brexit talks: Britain accuses EU of treating UK as 'unworthy' partner,"Britain’s chief negotiator, David Frost, has accused Brussels of treating the UK as an “unworthy” partner by offering a low-quality trade agreement that he says would force the country to “bend to EU norms”. In an extraordinary letter to the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, the prime minister’s envoy says Brussels’ proposal that EU state aid rules be part of British law is “egregious” and “simply not a provision any democratic country could sign”. He further accuses Barnier of demanding unprecedented oversight over British laws and institutions through “novel and unbalanced proposals”, in an intervention that will heighten fears that the talks are now destined to fail. The letter, sent shortly after the publication of the UK’s draft trade and security treaty, highlights the tension at the heart of the negotiation over Britain’s future relationship with the EU after a series of poor rounds of videoconference talks. The British negotiator seeks to reassure Barnier that he is not trying to negotiate with the member states through publication of the legal text but to “clear up any misunderstandings about the purpose and effect of what we have put to you”. Frost says the EU demands would tie the UK to Brussels’ labour, environmental and social standards while offering a trade deal that fails to match those signed with others in reducing barriers to trade in animal products, motor vehicles, medicinal products, organics and chemicals. He writes that the UK government’s proposed free trade deal is very close to that signed with Canada. The draft fisheries proposal is akin to that between the EU and Norway, he claims, and on aviation he says the UK is not seeking more than that given to other non-EU countries. “Given this reality, we find it perplexing that the EU, instead of seeking to settle rapidly a high-quality set of agreements with a close economic partner, is instead insisting on additional, unbalanced and unprecedented provisions in a range of areas, as a precondition for agreement between us. Overall, we find it hard to see what makes the UK, uniquely among your trading partners, so unworthy of being offered the kind of well-precedented arrangements commonplace in modern [free trade agreements].” In response to the EU argument that proximity and levels of trade require the UK to remain close to Brussels rules, Frost says Britain is less integrated than Switzerland, Norway or Ukraine and the argument on geography “amounts to saying that a country in Europe cannot expect to determine its own rules … and that it must bend to EU norms”. Earlier in the day, Michael Gove had said that success in the fourth round of the talks starting on 1 June depended upon “the EU recognising that the UK is sovereign”, after a notable lack of progress in last week’s talks. Barnier, in turn, welcomed Downing Street’s “transparency” after being blocked by the British government during the recent negotiations from sharing the text with the member states, adding that the bloc had already made its text public “over two months ago”. Pedro Silva Pereira, who is part of a cross-party group of MEPs overseeing the talks on behalf of the European parliament, said the negotiations needed a “political wake up call”. “And it is Boris Johnson who needs to wake up”, the Portuguese MEP said. The last chance to agree an extension to the transition period will come in June but Frost writes that the government does not believe it would be in British interests to stay in the customs union and single market after the end of the year.
Without a replacement deal, both sides will fall back on the World Trade Organization’s most favoured nation tariffs, which means duties on everyday food items from cheese to beef of more than 40%. The UK’s 291-page draft comprehensive free trade agreement was among the multiple Brexit papers made public by the government covering everything from aviation and fisheries to social security coordination and law enforcement. On level-playing-field provisions, so central to the EU’s proposal, the UK text contains a cut-and-paste from the EU’s trade deal with Canada stating merely that it would be “inappropriate to encourage trade or investment by weakening or reducing the levels of protection” in current labour laws and standards.
Neither the EU or the UK could “waive or otherwise derogate” from its own laws if the motivation is to win an economic advantage but there is nothing to prevent Britain from lowering its standards if it wished to do so. On state aid, a significant interest within the EU, the UK’s paper simply affords Brussels the right to “express its concerns” and request consultation. “The responding party shall afford full and sympathetic consideration to that request,” the document says."
2020-05-19T11:28:59Z,politics,Politics,Failure to explain UK's halt to mass Covid-19 testing in March 'unacceptable',"The failure to explain why the government took the significant and consequential decision to drop community testing at the start of the coronavirus outbreak is unacceptable, MPs have said in a damning letter to Boris Johnson. The science and technology committee’s investigation into the early handling of the pandemic calls for Public Health England to explain the scientific reasoning behind abandoning mass testing to concentrate instead on testing limited numbers in its own laboratories. The letter to the prime minister urges the government to learn from its experience. It states: “The decision to pursue an approach of initially concentrating testing in a limited number of laboratories and to expand them gradually, rather than an approach of surging capacity through a large number of available public sector, research institute, university and private sector labs is one of the most consequential made during this crisis. “From it followed the decision on 12 March to cease testing in the community and retreat to testing principally within hospitals. “Amongst other consequences, it meant that residents in care homes – even those displaying Covid-19 symptoms – and care home workers could not be tested at a time when the spread of the virus was at its most rampant. “The failure of PHE to publish the evidence on which its testing policy was based is unacceptable for a decision that may have had such significant consequences.”
The letter also criticises the government for a lack of transparency on the scientific advice it receives, and calls for a full list of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) participants to be updated regularly, including with the number of meetings they attended. One investigation finding was that “the transparency around scientific advice has not always been as clear as it should have been”, and the length of time it has taken to publish scientific papers on the government’s website was highlighted. All but two of the Sage members’ names have been published, and the committee suggested those who are not identified should instead disclose the disciplines that they work in, to give greater transparency around decision making. The MPs also found that it has not been clear why a nationwide sampling study for the virus could not have been instigated by the government at a much earlier stage. They suggest that had this been in operation even a month earlier, many of the decisions to be made on social distancing could have been made earlier and with more detailed data.
The UK’s national statistician, Sir Ian Diamond, told the committee he had been asked to set a study up on 17 April – more than three weeks after the country went into lockdown. The committee chair, Greg Clark, said the findings and recommendations were devised to be constructive. The MP said: “Greater transparency around scientific advice; putting capacity in place in advance of need, such as in testing and vaccines; collecting more data earlier and learning from other countries’ approaches are some of the early lessons of this pandemic that are relevant to further decisions that will need to be taken during the weeks and months ahead. “We hope the government will act on these recommendations which are offered in a constructive spirit based on the evidence we have taken so far.” The letter to Johnson follows six public evidence sessions. The inquiry continues."
2020-05-19T08:16:14Z,politics,Politics,"China presents itself as rival to democracy and plays UK, says Labour","China’s authoritarian rulers are presenting themselves as a viable rival to democracy and have played the UK economically, Stephen Kinnock, Labour’s foreign policy spokesman on China, has said. In a significant hardening of the party’s stance towards China, he also described David Cameron’s golden era of engagement with China as “an abject failure”, adding the UK has been naive about China’s intentions. Kinnock called for what he described as a “respect-based realism” towards China, and said he feared at present the UK had insufficient strategic independence from China to stand up to the country’s intimidation. The UK, he said, “had rolled out the red carpet for China and got very very little in return”. He pointed out that the UK is running a £22bn annual trade deficit with China. “It feels like it has been one-way traffic on the economy,” he said. “You can have a debate about trade figures but I think to a large extent we have been played … by a narrative that there was going to be an alignment of the international rules-based order, that there was going to be a slow but steady alignment with democratic norms. That clearly has not happened and the relationship has been too one way.”
Kinnock also proposed smarter and beefed-up takeover rules to protect UK firms by including new national security criteria. He called for a reset based on mutual respect and questioned whether China at present had any respect for the UK. He revealed he had recently met China’s “wolf warrior” diplomats at the Chinese embassy in London and found them to show very little respect and instead be largely aggressive. Kinnock has recently been appointed to the opposition frontbench by Keir Starmer, and his remarks are understood to be part of a Labour review of its stance on China and mirrors a similar shift in thinking on the Conservative benches. Speaking to the Radix UK thinktank on Monday night, he said that “managing the rise of China is the number one geopolitical challenge the world is facing” and added there was no single global challenge that can be handled without engagement with China. “All roads lead to China,” he said. But he said there was very little evidence that the west was exacting influence over China’s political trajectory. “If you look at the increasingly hard line they take on human rights issues, the Uighurs, what has been happening in Hong Kong or the position on Taiwan, there is very little evidence of any kind of success in terms of exerting or projecting our influence,” he said. He warned China was increasingly a systemic rival, seeing “its model of responsive authoritarian government becoming something that it sees as a viable alternative to democracy. “That is a message that is being consistently pumped out. Particularly after what has been a quite messy response to managing the coronavirus issue, China is putting itself forward as ‘look, our model of governance is the one that the world should be adopting’,” he said. He insisted that his criticisms did not detract from his admiration of China’s remarkable achievements over the past 30 years, or his call for mutual respect, adding: “There is a big question whether it is mutual and I am forced to draw the conclusion that, as things stand at the moment, it it not. I have had a conversation in recent days with someone that might be described as a wolf warrior diplomat and I would say there was very little respect in that conversation. There is a tone of what I would say was real aggression coming forward.”"
2020-05-18T19:16:27Z,politics,Politics,"Ready and preparing to be ready, Matt Hancock pleads for a last chance | John Crace","You can’t fault Matt Hancock’s Stakhanovite work ethic. Barely a day has gone by without him being sent out on to the government frontline. But the effort is clearly beginning to take its toll. In the past few weeks his normal Tiggerish enthusiasm and goodwill to all has given way to something rather more vulnerable. A man who feels himself not just under attack from a country that wonders why the health secretary hasn’t done rather more to protect the nation’s health, but also from the prime minister and cabinet colleagues who have been lining him up as the scapegoat in the inevitable public inquiry. The initial sign that Matt was not coping so well was in his snappiness. His tetchiness with MPs and members of the media whenever his version of events was challenged. Now though it’s looking as if Hancock is moving through the denial and anger stages of grief toward the bargaining and depression stages. There’s still a way to go before he comes to any form of acceptance but now there is a discernible sadness to his public performances. An emotional fragility that can barely be kept at bay. Other people’s anger he can just about deal with. It’s their compassion that will get him in the end. The Dear Matt text in which he is dumped with the words, “It’s not you, it’s me.” For his Commons coronavirus statement, it was all Matt could do to hold it together for an hour. Hardly surprising as he knows better than anyone that much of what he’s saying is pure fantasy. Though the truth might set him free, he’s just not quite ready for the admission of failure. So he began as if the coronavirus was a mild inconvenience, rather than the worst public health crisis for 100 years. We’d passed the peak – please, no one tell him about the probability of a second wave – and by and large everything was totally in control. The government had done brilliantly, hospitals had coped and NHS mental health services were there for anyone who needed them. Provided they were able to wait six months without falling apart completely for a referral to a professional. Care homes had had a protective ring thrown round them from the very start of the pandemic. As a description of the government’s handling of the crisis it could hardly have been more inaccurate. But this wasn’t about the public. It was about throwing a protective ring around Matt’s psyche. This was as close to reality as he could bring himself to get. There were a few new announcements. From now on anosmia – a lack of smell or taste – would be added to a persistent dry cough and high temperature as coronavirus symptoms. And anyone with any of these symptoms could now get a test if they could log on to the NHS website and find a testing station with capacity to see them. Best of all, Matt was able to report that he had beaten his target of recruiting 18,000 tracers – he didn’t know if they were yet trained – and now had 21,000 people on the books. Though given Hancock’s dodgy record on false accounting, it was quite possible that some of the new recruits may have been counted twice. Some politicians believe you need to be cruel to be kind. Labour’s shadow health secretary, John Ashworth, takes the opposite view and is kind to be cruel. He’s long since stopped being angry with Hancock over the government’s mishandling of the crisis and now just talks to him like an awkward teenager in whom he’s disappointed. It had been a bit late to include anosmia, hadn’t it? There hadn’t always been a protective ring around care homes, had there? And what was the point in easing lockdown restrictions before there was a comprehensive test and trace system up and running to replace them? Matt was now on the verge of breaking down. His eyes bloodshot as he tried to hold it together. Pleading for one last chance to make the relationship work. There was definitely a protective ring around care homes. Things would change. Get better, he promised. Having already forgotten that his new test and trace operation was supposed to have kicked in two days ago. Just one last chance, he pleaded. “We are ready and preparing,” he said, apparently unaware that the two were mutually exclusive. You’re either ready or you’re preparing. A few Tory backbenchers tried to put a socially-distanced arm around him and reassure him he was doing OK, but most just melted away. Matt left the chamber alone. Hopefully to have a long sob in private. He might just find it cathartic. Fifteen minutes later, Priti Patel made a rare public appearance as she reintroduced her immigration bill. Most of us have long since concluded that the home secretary has been kept hidden because she is fundamentally useless. But now some MPs were wondering if she might not also have had the coronavirus. Because there was a total lack of taste in announcing plans to keep low-paid overseas workers out of the country, when they are doing more than most to keep the NHS, care homes and food deliveries running. Still, Patel did want to pay a small tribute to those doing jobs she considers unskilled. Not least because she has also proved that being home secretary is low-skilled work. So, as a compromise, she proposed that everyone should continue clapping key workers at 8pm on a Thursday. Just to help them on their way to the deportation centre. She’s all heart, Priti."
2020-05-18T18:22:26Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: daily death toll rises by 160 to 34,796 — as it happened",Weâ€™re closing this UK liveblog now. You can follow the Guardianâ€™s global coverage here
2020-05-18T15:21:23Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus testing extended to anyone over age of five,"Coronavirus testing is being extended in the UK to anyone over the age of five with symptoms, Matt Hancock has announced, as it emerged that the national rollout for the government’s new test and track response appears set to be delayed to June. “Today, I can announce to the house that everyone aged five and over with symptoms is now eligible for a test,” the health secretary said in a statement to the Commons. “Anyone with a new continuous cough, a high temperature or the loss or change of sense of taste or smell can book a test.” Until now, eligibility had been limited to a series of groups including key workers, those aged over 65, people who could not work from home, or people who lived with someone from one of these groups. Those with symptoms can use the gov.uk website to book home test kits or appointments at drive-through centres across the country. The expansion follows a period in which the UK’s capacity for testing had exceeded the number of people seeking it. The most recent daily update showed that while there was capacity for almost 118,822 tests, 91,206 had been carried out. It comes amid confusion over the rollout for the NHS-designed track and test app, which along with a planned contingent of 18,000 contact-tracers is seen as key to plans to ease restrictions by alerting authorities to any localised outbreaks of Covid-19 and allowing them to be tackled. The app is being tested on the Isle of Wight. Last week, Hancock said the trial was going well and that the national rollout would happen “in mid-May”. Earlier on Monday, No 10 said only that it would happen “in the coming weeks”. Asked by his Labour shadow, Jonathan Ashworth, about the seeming delay, Hancock said the government was “ready and preparing for rolling out that system”, but gave no date. However, Hancock did say that the target for contract-tracers had been met, with more than 21,000 recruited.
Asked about the trial, Boris Johnson’s spokesman had said: “The pilot is ongoing in the Isle of Wight. The residents have been hugely supportive, with around 60,000 downloads on the island. Their feedback is vital in helping us to look at how the app is being used and how it can work with testing and contact tracing. And it remains our aim to roll out the app across the country in the coming weeks.”
Asked about the apparent change in the timeframe, the spokesman said the only commitment for mid-May had been to recruit the 18,000 contact tracers. “It is possible to do track and trace work separately to the app, and that’s obviously something that happened previously. And it’s perfectly possible to do that again,” the spokesman said when asked whether the system was dependent on the app. He also indicated it was possible the second phase of relaxing the lockdown, during which some schools and shops would open, could happen without the track and trace system operational.
Asked whether this was necessary, the spokesman said: “What we have said in relation to step two is that we will only move forwards if it is safe to do so, and that we will need to look at the five tests, which the government has in place, and we will need to study carefully both the R rate and the rate of new infections.” R is the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to, and needs to be kept below one in order to control the spread of the virus.
On Sunday, it emerged that one of the private-sector companies handling the recruitment for trackers had sent emails that said the process was on hold while the government considered an alternative app. The Department of Health and Social Care said the email was “wrong and could cause confusion”, and recruitment for both the online and phone-based contact-tracing service was continuing “at pace”. Asked whether the NHS app was working, Johnson’s spokesman said: “We are closely studying the first phase of the rollout and expect to be able to improve the app based on user feedback from the Isle of Wight. As with any tech project of this size, you would expect us to keep all options under review to make sure the app is as effective as possible.”"
2020-05-18T06:20:25Z,politics,Politics,Coronavirus: contact-tracing applicants in England wrongly told hiring paused,"Ministers have been accused of “misstep after misstep” after applicants to become contact tracers for the NHS in England were told recruitment was on hold while the government considered an alternative app. After struggles with sourcing personal protective equipment and building up sufficient testing capacity, track, trace and isolate is the latest major challenge for the government. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, insisted on Sunday that the track and trace scheme would be ready to launch nationwide by the end of the month, with “just over 17,000” contact tracers already hired. But emails seen by the Guardian, sent this weekend by one of the private-sector companies handling the recruitment process, Kent-based HR Go, said hiring had been paused.
“Thank you for your online application for this role. Unfortunately earlier today the roles were put on hold. This is due to a delay in the launch of the ‘Track and Trace’ app itself while the government considers an alternative app,” the emails said. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said the email was “wrong and could cause confusion”, and recruitment for both the online and phone-based contact-tracing service was continuing “at pace”. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said: “Test, trace and isolate is fundamental to managing and controlling this virus and safely easing lockdown – yet the government’s approach has been increasingly chaotic, with misstep after misstep.” The government is battling to maintain public trust for the difficult second phase of managing the crisis after replacing the blunt “stay at home, save lives” message with the more nebulous “stay alert”. Boris Johnson acknowledged on Sunday he could understand the public’s frustration. He wrote in the Mail on Sunday: “I recognise what we are now asking is more complex than simply staying at home – but this is a complex problem and we need to trust in the good sense of the British people.” The NHS’s digital arm, NHSX, has developed its own coronavirus tracking app, which will hold data centrally, instead of opting for an alternative from Google and Apple that operates in a decentralised way. If a user becomes unwell with symptoms of Covid-19, they can choose to let the app inform the NHS. They will be offered testing, and an anonymous alert will inform other app users with whom they spent time over the previous few days.
Thousands of contact tracers, many of them working from home, will work alongside the app, speaking to Covid-19 sufferers about whom they may have been in contact with, and giving advice – for example, urging them to self-isolate. Ministers want to be able to use the data gathered to analyse the spread of the virus. They hope this will allow them to reimpose lockdown conditions in local areas where a new outbreak is detected – a process Johnson has described as “whack-a-mole”. But the app is working against constraints in modern smartphones that only Google and Apple can work around, as well as arriving burdened with privacy concerns that could deter some members of the public from using it. People who had applied for contact-tracing jobs through the government’s gov.uk website were told this weekend: “As and when the app (or an alternative) goes live, we will reconsider those applications already received, however please be aware that we have received an unprecedented number of applications for this role and therefore not all suitable candidates will be able to be put forward.” Confronted by the Guardian about the claim in the email that an alternative app was being considered, a spokesperson for HR Go confirmed it had sent the emails, but insisted: “What has been said is a miscommunication and false. We are not aware of any reason why Track and Track [sic] would not being continuing as it should. We will be communicating with the applicants directly to correct that once we have completed our internal investigations.”
The DHSC spokesperson said: “The NHS contact-tracing app is not on hold and it would be completely wrong to suggest otherwise. There is no alternative app and the NHS continues to work constructively with many other organisations that are helping to develop and test the NHS Covid-19 app.” The Guardian revealed last week that the app’s advisory board was split over whether it had the authority to tell the government to ditch its version and switch to the Apple and Google version. After a meeting on Thursday, it emerged that members argued their role on the board was limited to providing guidance on ethical questions, and not to branch out into a broader discussion of whether the app is the right tool for the job. Some government officials believe the NHSX app may not survive in its current form after trials on the Isle of Wight. Software for a decentralised version by Apple and Google is expected to be released on Tuesday. The government gave up trying to track every UK case of Covid-19 in March, when the virus began circulating in the community. The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said at the time: “There comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention.” But Ashworth and the health secretary Matt Hancock’s immediate predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, have repeatedly called for community tracing.
If the track and trace system is ready to roll out by the end of month, it would be in time to provide reassurance to parents and teachers that individual cases in English schools could be identified and isolated if they reopen to more pupils from 1 June, as the government is demanding. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, suggested last week that just 1,500 contact tracers of the 18,000 promised by Hancock had been hired, but government sources now say that number was out of date. Appearing on Sophy Ridge on Sunday on SkyNews, Gove heaped praise on Hancock, amid reports of a testy relationship between the health secretary and No 10. “We’re on course to meet that target. It’s more evidence that we have, in Matt, an energetic and determined health secretary who is throwing everything into the fight against this virus,” Gove said. • The headline on this article was amended on 19 May 2020 to clarify that the story was about the contact tracing operation in England, not the UK as stated in an earlier version."
2020-05-17T23:01:13Z,politics,Politics,Despite UK furlough scheme 6 million fear losing their job – study,"As many as 6 million people in Britain fear losing their job within six months as the coronavirus outbreak causes the biggest economic shock in living memory, a study has warned. With much of business and social life at a standstill despite gradual steps to reopen the economy, the Centre for Labour and Social Studies (Class) said workers feared the coronavirus recession would be worse than the 2008 financial crash. As many as one in five people in a survey of 2,000 workers by Survation for the leftwing thinktank said they were worried about losing their jobs, despite government efforts to cushion the blow using its wage subsidy scheme.
Extended by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, until October to avoid spiralling job losses this summer, the government is subsidising about 7.5m jobs at almost 1m companies through the furlough programme. After just two full days of its operation more than a million self-employed workers made claims for over £3bn in emergency support through a similar scheme for people who work for themselves. However, the survey found that 60% of workers are just three months or less away from defaulting on their rent or mortgage, suggesting the scheme has not stopped people feeling that they are perilously close to disaster. The report follows evidence that almost a third of Britain’s lowest-paid workers have lost their job or been furloughed in the past two months, while job losses are starting to rise for those missing out on the government support schemes. Surveys from the Office for National Statistics also indicate more than 80% of the public expect their financial situation to deteriorate or stay the same in the next year, as the pandemic triggers the worst global recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s. Class urged the government to launch a job creation scheme and substantial spending stimulus to refocus the economy, calling for Britain to grow its way out of the slump with well-paid green jobs. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said the survey highlighted how stressful life was on low wages and with insecure work. “Life has become harder still in the Covid-19 crisis – especially for those on the frontline. “Although the problems these workers face have existed for many years, the Covid-19 crisis has laid them bare for all to see. And it has intensified the injustice.”
The trades union-funded thinktank also found widespread public support for giving key workers, including NHS staff, care workers, shop workers and delivery drivers a pay rise. At the same time 69% of those polled supported taxing the wealthy more to help pay for the crisis. Faiza Shaheen, director of Class, said: “Protecting workers now requires us looking past emergency measures to a recovery plan. Coronavirus has put society in an X-ray machine to reveal its structural weakness and is now magnifying existing inequalities. “It is up to the chancellor to seize this opportunity, to build a bridge from the furlough scheme and unemployment benefits to green jobs and a fairer society.”"
2020-05-17T23:01:12Z,politics,Politics,Keeping schools closed in England will widen inequalities – study,"Keeping schools closed to tackle the coronavirus pandemic is almost certain to increase educational inequalities between children from the richest and poorest families, according to a study, as debate intensifies over the government’s push to reopen schools in England. Survey data from more than 4,000 families in England analysed by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that by the end of this month, children in better-off families will have received a week and half more home learning than children in the poorest households during the closures. The government is pressing for primary schools in England to reopen for some year groups from 1 June. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, said on Sunday: “The clear scientific and clinical advice is that it is safe to have schools reopen, accompanied with social distancing.”
He said schools could implement staggered lunch breaks and arrival times, seat children at individual desks, and teach them in classes of 15 at most, each class supervised by one adult. Asked on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show what he would say to local authorities that have questioned the plan, Gove said: “I respectfully ask them to think again. If you really care about children, you’ll want them to be in schools. You will want them to be learning. You will want them to have new opportunities. So look to your responsibilities.” Teaching unions and headteachers as well as senior opposition politicians implored the government to release in full the scientific advice used to make its decisions. At a meeting to explain the advice last week, the unions received a commitment from Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, to publish the advice as a priority, but as yet no date has been set. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: “We urge the government to publish the science, and to ensure the test, track and isolate is in place.” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told members he had been reassured by last week’s science briefing, and the union was “able to support the government’s ambition” with caveats. But Barton also said the union would continue to stand by headteachers who were unable to reopen their schools by 1 June. The IFS survey highlighted a string of advantages enjoyed by children from affluent families at both state or independent schools, including easier access to computers and the internet at home, more private or family tuition and the use of their own study space. “These differences will likely widen pre-existing gaps in test scores between children from different backgrounds,” said Lucy Kraftman, a research economist at the IFS and one of the report’s authors. But the survey showed little enthusiasm among parents for a return to the classroom: just 39% of primary school parents and 45% of secondary school parents said they would send their children back if they had a choice. While the governments of Scotland and Wales have ruled out reopening on 1 June – other than to children of key workers and vulnerable pupils – the Westminster government showing few signs of backing away from the date announced by Boris Johnson. Slough council because the latest local authority in England to downplay 1 June as a start date for their maintained schools, echoing councils in Hartlepool, Gateshead and Liverpool. In a message from Slough’s head of children’s services, seen by the Guardian, parents were told: “Many schools in Slough have said they will not be welcoming more children into school until 8 June at the earliest. Please do not send your children to school unless your child’s school has contacted you directly to offer a place.” The IFS survey found that children from better-off families were spending 30% more time each day on educational activities – including 75 minutes a day on average more on school work – compared with those from the poorest fifth of households, with the gap widening to 90 minutes among primary school pupils. Across primary and secondary schools, children in the richest 20% of households have been spending 5.8 hours a day on what the IFS defined as learning activities, while those in the poorest quintile are spending 4.5 hours a day. Jules White, the headteacher of Tanbridge House school in Sussex, described the IFS’s results as “powerful but completely unsurprising”. He said: “If government and other groups are so worried about the disproportionately terrible effects of the lockdown on vulnerable children and families, why isn’t there a complete focus on getting these children back to school first? “Schools have been looking after the most disadvantaged families with scant support for years. We are not about to stop now. Let us get on safely and intelligently for every child and every family.” Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “This is an important study. Lockdown has provided a unique opportunity for policymakers to reboot their attitude to disadvantage and equality of opportunity. The disadvantage gap was huge before lockdown. Schools have taken action since to ensure that any further disadvantage has been minimised. “Without doubt, education plays a key role in navigating a route out of poverty, but a lack of education does not in itself cause poverty. Other social factors do that, and to date they have consistently worked against schools efforts. We need to rethink of how we tackle inequality in this country.” The IFS also offered a “stark warning” to the government in how it handles reopening schools. Parents on higher incomes were the most willing to send their children back into the classroom when the lockdown ends, rising to around 50% in the wealthiest quintile. But only a third of those from the poorest 20% of households were in favour. “This risks leaving the children least able to cope with home learning remaining at home even as their better-off classmates return to school,” said Alison Andrew, a senior IFS researcher and one of the authors. The survey was completed by more than 4,000 parents of children aged between four and 15 at school in England, between 29 April and 12 May. Johnson’s announcement that primary schools could reopen from 1 June for reception, year 1and year 6 classes was made on 9 May, although the date had been reported widely the week before."
2020-05-17T19:00:07Z,politics,Politics,UK to publish draft treaty in effort to reboot Brexit process,"British negotiators fear Michel Barnier has been unable to get EU leaders to focus on Brexit trade and security talks as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, as Downing Street prepares to publish a draft treaty this week in an effort to reboot the process. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, believes his EU counterpart recognises the need to budge on key issues, including fisheries, over which France, the Netherlands and Spain have imposed a tough line. Barnier said on Friday that he expected both sides to shift from their “maximalist” stance on access to British waters by June. It is hoped in Whitehall that laying out legal text will prompt EU states to become more engaged with discussions over all aspects of the future relationship.
The UK document in treaty form will lay bare the stark differences between the two sides on key areas after what both agreed had been another disappointing round of talks last week. Downing Street believes the British position has so far been mischaracterised, and a UK source close to the negotiations described the EU’s attitude to date as bewildering. Senior government figures are convinced that part of the problem lies in European governments being distracted by the pandemic. On Friday, Barnier accused the British negotiators of again seeking to cherrypick membership of the bloc by seeking minimal obligations on standards in the trade in goods and maximum rights. “We have been clear that we are not looking for that,” said one UK source close to the negotiation. “Anyone who thinks this government has got nostalgia for 2018 or Chequers has an imperfect understanding of UK political developments in the last couple of years.
“The only explanation I can find is that their arguments on the merits are not working and they are reaching for some of the old script. But it doesn’t fit the actual situation we are now trying to negotiate.” Boris Johnson resigned from his post as foreign secretary in Theresa May’s government in July 2018 following publication of a vision of a trade deal agreed by the cabinet at the prime minister’s Chequers retreat. It outlined a close trading relationship based on alignment between EU and UK laws. UK sources said the requests Barnier cited as evidence for his claims, including freedom of movement for short visits and recognition of professional qualifications to enable British lawyers, accountants and auditors to work in the EU, were all included in previous free trade deals. With British negotiators determined to energise the talks, the forthcoming legal text will highlight a series of areas where there are mutual interests, including the maintenance of the British car industry and its supply chains. For vehicles exported to the EU from the UK to receive preferential tariff rates it would have to be shown that at least 50% of their components were British-manufactured.
The UK government wants to include EU-derived components in that 50% through so called “third-country cumulation”, a proposal that Barnier had not embraced in full, Whitehall sources said. Barnier’s team has also rejected the UK’s proposals to reduce the administrative burden of sanitary and phytosanitary checks at borders to protect human, animal and plant life, it is claimed. The UK is seeking equivalence between EU and British rules and the legal text is expected to detail how that might work. EU sources have said that on fisheries they were encouraged by the provision last week of a framework agreement on how the UK intends to open its waters to European fleets. “I think the UK has moved since the beginning,” one EU official said. “Originally they said they didn’t want an agreement on this, but since then they’ve expressed a wish to discuss fisheries and get an agreement.” British sources said it remained the case that the UK would not allow the continuation of the common fisheries policy in which historical patterns of catches determine today’s hauls. The UK’s proposal is expected to be part of the documents made public. The pressure is on both sides to find common ground as the point by which any extension to the transition period would have to be agreed looms. Under the withdrawal agreement, an extension of “up to one or two years” must be agreed by 1 July. The two teams will restart talks in the first week of June. EU officials said there was no other legal avenue to an extension. “We have seen in the last days several articles and reflections [asking] is this the only way,” the official said. “This is the last moment to ask this question of the transition period.” A UK spokesman said: “We intend to make public all the UK draft legal texts during next week so that the EU’s member states and interested observers can see our approach in detail.” One UK source close to the negotiation said Barnier was “doing a good job with the hand he has been given” but added that the mandate handed to him by the EU capitals was “unnegotiable” in key areas."

2020-05-17T06:00:51Z,politics,Politics,Who'd be a health secretary? Five former incumbents on the toughest gig in politics,"One effect of the unprecedented socioeconomic impact of Covid-19 has been to catapult the secretary of state for health and social care to the forefront of British politics. For the long month of April, with the prime minister either in intensive care with the disease or recuperating in isolation, there was no one with a more prominent government profile than Matt Hancock. It was, to say the least, an unusual predicament for a health secretary. Since the controversy around the target of 100,000 daily coronavirus tests and Boris Johnson’s return to work, Hancock has taken a small step back from the limelight. But if, in the final analysis, he is adjudged to have had a good pandemic, he could well be seen as a leader in waiting. On the other hand, if the UK’s death count ends up the highest in Europe, as it currently stands, and the reports continue to mount of shortages in protective clothing and problems with testing and tracing, then history’s equivalent of a surgical waste bin may well await him. Glory or infamy – those are the grand stakes in this unparalleled peacetime civil operation. Yet any halfway ambitious politician would relish the chance to be in Hancock’s shoes right now. And it’s rare that that can be said about the occupant of his office. Come the casino hour of our parliamentary system – the cabinet reshuffle – very few politicians entering No 10 hope to be named health secretary. It’s a post with no visible upside. When anything goes wrong in health, someone usually dies. And things always go wrong. On top of which, the terrain is knee-deep in well-organised interest groups, all demanding more of everything. A widespread wariness about the job was most memorably captured in the response of the pugnacious Labour politician John Reid when appointed in 2003 by Tony Blair. “Oh fuck,” he’s supposed to have said, “not health.” Kenneth Clarke, who was health secretary in the last couple of years of Margaret Thatcher’s premiership, says that over the years he has issued a warning to various successors, both Labour and Conservative: “You’re going to a political graveyard. If you can survive it, then you’re ready, really ready, for the heat of frontline politics.” Clarke describes the role as one of constant bombardment, unrelenting demands to do what others say, ceaseless criticism in the press, from opposition and interest groups, repeated declarations of a crisis and almost universal unpopularity, including among your cabinet colleagues. It sounds, I say, like the job from hell. “I thought it was just immense fun,” says Clarke.
He’s not being ironic. He really did savour the challenge. The key thing, he says, is that you have to be prepared to “roll your sleeves up and defend yourself”. If that conjures up an image of the health secretary working in a bare-knuckle boxing ring rather than a government department, then Norman Fowler makes a similar observation. “In my day,” he says, “the most important quality [of a health secretary] was an ability to fight your corner in the public spending battles.” As a belligerent spirit was the signature style of the first modern health secretary, Aneurin Bevan, perhaps it should be no surprise that, like ministerial red boxes, it has become part of the job description. The machismo might explain why the health ministry has been largely a male preserve. There have only been three female health secretaries, beginning in 1974 with Barbara Castle, who, it must be said, was no shrinking violet. (Virginia Bottomley and Patricia Hewitt were approached for this piece, but both declined to speak.) Although there has been some kind of minister for health dating back to the mid-19th century, it was not until a hundred years later, and the arrival in 1945 of Bevan, that the role we recognise today first took shape. A former miner who left school at 13, Bevan was a renowned political bruiser who drove through the National Health Service Act with unyielding determination.
He had to overcome opposition from his own Labour benches as well as from within the Conservative party and the British Medical Association (BMA), whose members disparaged him as the “Tito of Tonypandy”. But facing down his opponents, Bevan created a free-at-the-point-of-delivery health service for all, one that opened its doors on 5 July 1948. By the time he died 12 years after the NHS’s birth, Bevan had become a national hero. That can’t be said of any of his often unloved successors, although each of them has played a part in developing an NHS that has grown far beyond what Bevan envisaged. “The budget was £200m the year Nye Bevan introduced the NHS,” says Alan Johnson, health secretary under Gordon Brown. “It was £110 bn when I left the job.”
It is currently £140bn. Even accounting for inflation, that’s an extraordinary increase; yet whatever the figure, it’s never enough. The NHS is the fifth-largest employer in the world. It’s a gargantuan operation that necessarily contains large inefficiencies and daunting shortages. But we pay less per head of population for our health system than any other major western nation. That’s one reason the NHS is perennially viewed as underfunded – even though health is about the only government department whose budget has never been cut. Nearly all governments are accused of shortchanging the NHS, but in particular Conservatives, who have traditionally been seen as, at best, reluctant supporters of the NHS, and more often as would-be privatisers. All the Conservative former health secretaries I spoke to think this accusation is unfair and inaccurate, and bemoan the fact that they had to spend rather too much time in office contesting a falsehood. Nonetheless, Margaret Thatcher was once keen to see the UK adopt a US-style private insurance-funded health service. And from time to time, a Conservative thinktank or backbench ideologue will revisit the proposal, to keep the dream alive. Fowler, who served as health secretary for six years under Thatcher, accepts these points. “But,” he protests, “the significant thing is that those ideas have never got anywhere. And if they didn’t get anywhere under Margaret Thatcher, they’re not likely to get anywhere under any other prime minister.” Matt Hancock’s immediate predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, complains that whatever he did in the job, he always faced the same charge of having a secret agenda. “I was accused of starving the NHS of funds as a way of persuading the public that the only option was privatisation,” he says. “I then secured a £20bn rise in budget and the very same people said on Twitter: ‘Ah, he’s fattening the NHS up for privatisation.’” In fact, Conservative spending on health was limited for most of Hunt’s time in office and during that of his predecessor, Andrew Lansley, at least by comparison with the boom times of the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. In large part this was due to the austerity measures that the Coalition and Conservative governments imposed, following the 2008 financial crisis. Some critics have suggested that the shortfall in protective clothing for NHS staff witnessed in this pandemic is in part a legacy of underfunding during Hunt’s tenure. “I felt throughout my time as health secretary that it did need more resources,” Hunt concedes. “There is more you can do on efficiency, but in the end only so much, and it needed more resources.” In 2016, while Hunt was still in office, Exercise Cygnus was conducted to test how the UK would respond to a pandemic. According to leaked sections of the report, which has never been published, it was found that the country was not ready to cope, particularly in the area of social care. Hunt still maintains that austerity was the right policy to put the economy back on its feet, but he adds: “I don’t want to minimise the fact that this was a very tough period for the NHS.”
Hunt is now chair of the Health and Social Care select committee, in which position he has questioned some of Hancock’s decisions during the pandemic, such as prematurely discontinuing community testing. He’s reluctant to put Hancock on the spot, but says the key concern is to ask if we’re following the most effective international policy. “It’s been very clear that international best practice for managing coronavirus has been in Asia. I think because China’s totalitarian it was thought there was not much point looking too closely at what was happening there, because they can do things we could never do in a free society. But I think we could have looked at [South] Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, which are all democracies.” One fan of Hunt’s work on the health select committee is Alan Johnson. “I think he’s doing a great job as chair,” he says, which is probably not the verdict he would give on Hunt’s time in office. Like Hunt, Johnson emphasises the drive to improve patient care as his biggest motivating factor when he was health secretary. He therefore had little time for those who perceived any outsourcing of services as backdoor privatisation. “You talk to people on the left and the job of the NHS is to employ public service workers,” he says, shaking his head in our FaceTime call. “Not to improve disgraceful waiting times.” For all his modernising zeal, Johnson says the NHS’s greatest strength is its old-fashioned social solidarity, a quality, be argues, that Conservatives don’t really understand. “It’s against all the philosophy they’ve imbibed.” The irony, then, is that social solidarity has never been more loudly promoted among Tories than by this current government. The NHS has been rebranded “Our NHS”, its workers hailed as national heroes, invoked at every turn by politicians and applauded every Thursday evening by the public. Although the form of expression is new, the sentiment is not. The NHS invariably features at the top of the list of institutions of which Britons feel most proud. The problem for health secretaries is that this national pride can manifest as an over-protectiveness – “Hands off the NHS” – that leaves them limited room for manoeuvre.
As such, they often find themselves caught between contradictory instructions: improve the service and leave it alone. Fowler knows the syndrome well. “Put it this way,” he says, “one of the most serious bursts of applause I’ve ever had was when I was introduced at a conference of medical experts as the only secretary of state who didn’t try to reorganise the health service.” Clarke is less familiar with that kind of resounding applause. He embarked on a major overhaul of management, creating an internal market inspired in part, he says, by a need to head off Thatcher’s more radical proposals. It led to a series of massive rows between the prime minister and her health secretary. “Someone once told me we had 14 meetings about it,” he says, both amazed and amused by the number. “She was even more combative than I am. It was basically a bureaucratic shambles,” he says of the service he set about reforming, “as there was no proper management or control of the system.” In spite of his own restructuring of the NHS, which he says has stood the test of time because no one has reversed it, Clarke doesn’t think constant organisational reform is a good thing. “That must sound off coming from me. But you can’t have every secretary of state going in for an upheaval like that.” In a highly competitive field, perhaps the greatest upheaval was wrought by Andrew Lansley, David Cameron’s first health secretary. He is the exemplar of a longstanding NHS paradox – decentralisation from above. The more he argued for local empowerment, the more he micromanaged the transition, bolstering GPs, creating Public Health England, abolishing primary care trusts and much else besides. The consensus among his fellow health secretaries is that the reforms were misjudged, confusing and unnecessary. “I think Cameron thinks of [the Lansley reforms] as the biggest mistake he made,” says Johnson, cunningly recruiting the former prime minister to make his point. A little more diplomatically, Clarke says that he’s not convinced the reforms were “the main thing the health service needed”. Andy Burnham, who took over from Johnson and then shadowed Lansley, suggests that many of the changes have subsequently been abandoned or ignored. If reorganisational exhaustion in the wake of Lansley dampened the appetite for re-envisioning the NHS, Covid-19 has removed it from the agenda for the foreseeable future. For all its terrible toll of death and devastation, a major pandemic is a clarifying experience. Suddenly, discussions about rationalising regional management structures are beside the point. There is instead a unity of purpose and a galvanising sense of clear battle lines. It’s no coincidence that the most common political metaphors employed in the Covid-19 debate are military ones. Just as every defence secretary works to avoid war, but only really comes into his or her own when war breaks out, no health secretary wants a pandemic, and yet it’s their career-defining moment.
If Fowler is remembered by some clinicians for his executive light touch, he is better known for his performance during the Aids crisis in the mid-1980s. It’s easy to forget, amid the relentless news coverage of Covid-19, but HIV was a killer virus for which there was no treatment when it first came to light. It has since killed tens of millions around the world, though in the UK today, HIV is seldom fatal. Initially, it sparked enormous fear and stigmatisation, particularly of the gay community, which suffered a disproportionate number of deaths. But it was a period that Fowler looks back on with most professional and political satisfaction. “The whole health service worked together; no question, no arguments,” he says. “And when it acts together it really is a wonderful service.”
There is also another feature of pandemics that can bring the best out in politicians. As few, if any, health secretaries come from medical backgrounds, they usually find themselves deferring to clinical expertise. This is especially true in a pandemic. The difference is that the art of communication – the politician’s area of expertise – also becomes increasingly important. In Fowler’s case, he had the job of informing the public and reforming its behaviour – primarily, encouraging the use of condoms. Hence the government’s bold advertising campaign “Don’t Die of Ignorance”, which grabbed the nation’s anxious attention in 1987. “The campaign was criticised for being over the top, but the follow-up survey showed that over 90% of the public agreed with it,” says Fowler. He also had to do battle with Thatcher, and some of his cabinet colleagues, who were either squeamish or positively damning about issues of gay sexual practice and intravenous drug use – the main conduits of HIV transmission in this country. “I got totally frustrated in 1986,” he recalls. “It was a national crisis and I didn’t think we were making the progress we should be making in a national crisis. I remember being asked: ‘Do we have to have this section on risky sex?’ The whole point of the advertisement was to explain to people why they should avoid what they called risky sex!” Given the prime ministerial scrutiny he was under, I ask him whether it’s at all liberating for a health secretary if your boss is, as Johnson recently was, out of commission. “I never had that luxury,” he laments. “Theoretically, it’s not an ideal circumstance.” Fowler is not the only health secretary in living memory who faced a pandemic in office. “I was three days into the job when a global pandemic was declared with swine flu,” says Burnham, adding as a humorous aside: “As he exited the door, Mr Alan Johnson proved again that he’s a master of political timing.” Interestingly, Johnson recalls the pandemic as something that happened on his shift. “What took up most of my time?” he asks. “Well, there was the pandemic, of course.” In the event, regardless of who was in the hot seat, the H1N1 swine flu was not nearly as life-threatening as first feared. Some critics consequently suggested that the Labour government and the two health secretaries overreacted. But both men highlight the fact that a pandemic was top of the government risk register and they were well prepared to deal with it. Just as a flawed or under-resourced plan can leave a health secretary on the defensive, the more successful a strategy is, the less people get to see how bad things might have been. In a political sense it’s a lose-lose situation. “It was kind of a fraught terrain in those early days of swine flu,” remembers Burnham. “I made mistakes wrestling with these issues and sometimes came down on the wrong side.” He regrets putting the worst-case scenario statistics in the public domain – 60,000 deaths were predicted at the upper end, but there were actually fewer than 500. He also recalls a “car crash” TV interview with Andrew Castle, whose daughter had had a seriously adverse reaction to Tamiflu, the prophylactic issued to children. “I came away thinking, I’m not the person to be defending Tamiflu on national television,” he says.
His advice for Hancock is to resist the temptation to front the message too much on TV. Hunt, however, has only praise for what he says has been a strong communications campaign with a clear message – we spoke before the much-criticised change from “stay home” to “stay alert”. That said, he believes a longer-term strategy should be clearly outlined. “People need to understand how we’re going to exit the current situation.” Clarke picks out Hancock as a good performer among some less impressive government ministers, but he offers a word of caution directly to the young health secretary. “My advice to you will be, don’t start giving forecasts when we’re dealing with a total unknown here, and don’t start making forecasts on testing.” Several of the former health secretaries thought that Hancock made himself a hostage to fortune with his promise of reaching 100,000 coronavirus tests by the end of April. But all agree that it won’t be until an inquiry is held after the crisis has passed that any worthwhile or lasting judgments can be made on the government’s and Hancock’s handling of the pandemic. In the meantime, Burnham thinks the best thing to come out of the crisis is that the NHS will no longer be under any kind of existential threat, real or imagined. “Nobody will privatise it now; nobody will introduce different funding models. It’s finally entered into that sort of sacred space.” He argues that social care provision should be folded into the NHS. While he’s long supported this option, he says the case is irrefutable now the limitations of the social care system have been thoroughly exposed by Covid-19. “How can someone who is so essential that they are caring for another human being not be paid the living wage?” he asks. “It’s shameful.” There seems little doubt that social care is the neglected side of the portfolio in the Department of Health and Social Care, the unloved child forever in the shadow of its revered sibling. It would amount to a massive undertaking and significant investment to bring social care under the NHS umbrella. Whether or not it’s something Hancock will consider, it’s hard to believe that what Johnson calls the “scandalous crisis in adult social care” can be allowed to continue after the viral dust has settled. There have been no shortage of predictions – some wildly optimistic, others darkly ominous – about the post-Covid-19 world. The first task, obviously, is to make it a post-Covid-19 world, and in that endeavour the health secretary has a vital role to play. It’s far too early to know what the outcome will look like, or when it will arrive, but perhaps we can tentatively suggest that in the next cabinet reshuffle the word on the health job won’t be a four-letter one. In brief: how was it for them? Norman Fowler, Conservative, in post 1981–1987
Key issue How to mount an Aids public awareness campaign. Initial view of the post? “I knew all the problems. [But] it was not at all clear where the political advantages were.” Most satisfying aspect of the job? “It goes back to Aids again. With something like the virus, you know more than your medical experts about how to communicate to the public.” Greatest strength of the NHS? “It’s an institution that is valued and recognised by the vast majority of the public.” Greatest weakness? “It tends to be a bit of a political football.” Do you think public health workers are adequately rewarded? “You could make a very strong case for looking at all this again, particularly with nurses, who have been working, at times, at peril.” Kenneth Clarke, Conservative, in post 1988–1990
Key issue How to reform the NHS without adopting an American system. Advice he was given? “You’ve got to find a concession to give the BMA at least once a year.” His own advice? “The aim of any decent department minister is to get the prime minister to take as little interest in the subject as possible.” Most satisfying aspect of the job? “Knowing that you’re trying to make a difference to something that is vitally important – the wellbeing of the country.” Do you think public health workers are adequately rewarded? “Yes, though it’s gone up and down over the years. They’re much better paid now than they were in my time.” Alan Johnson, Labour, in post 2007–2009
Key issue “We had a bad deal with the drug companies that was supposed to last for six years. I pulled it and went through the whole process again to get a better deal on drugs.” Most satisfying aspect of the job? “The feeling that you were in a small way part of something so crucial to people’s lives. That was a privilege.” On Matt Hancock’s performance: “I’m not really impressed. I don’t think Matt Hancock’s as good as he thinks he is.” Do you think public health workers are adequately rewarded? “By the time we left office they were a lot more adequately rewarded than they had been. But it’s slipped back again; so no, I don’t think they’re adequately rewarded.” Andy Burnham, Labour, in post 2009–2010
Key issue Organising the response to the H1N1 swine flu pandemic. Most satisfying aspect of the job? “There was an independent review that said the response to the swine flu was highly satisfactory.” What did you find difficult about the job? “I inherited stuff I never felt comfortable with. I would point to the use of the private sector. I was never an advocate of that.” Do you have sympathy for Matt Hancock? “I thought it was awful when one of the newspapers had a Number 10 briefing against him. That was a cruel moment. I think he needs to be given the benefit of the doubt. It’s a tough gig and he’s made some obvious mistakes, but given the severity of what he’s been dealing with, he’s not doing badly.” Do you think public health workers are adequately rewarded? “Let me talk about social care workers: 58% of carers, the majority of whom are women, do not receive a real living wage. That’s disgraceful.” Jeremy Hunt, Conservative, in post 2012-2018
Key issue The imposition of new contracts for junior doctors which led to prolonged strike action. Most satisfying aspect of the job? “My greatest satisfaction was in some of the interactions I had with patients and families who had really suffered badly as a result of something going wrong. They were people actually who kept me going for nearly six years.” Biggest surprise? “I found out that 150 people a week die in the NHS because of errors in their medical treatment. I was gobsmacked by that. Then I discovered this was actually true all over the world; this is what happens in medicine.” Have you ever been interested in privatising the NHS? “I’ve always been a passionate believer in the NHS. There’s something about what the NHS stands for which speaks to the best of British values.” Do you think this pandemic calls for the help of former health secretaries? “I think there’s a role for people outside politics to come in in moments of national crisis. There are times when you need people who can – to use that horrible business phrase – JFDI things.”"
2020-05-16T20:05:19Z,politics,Politics,Rightwing thinktanks call time on age of austerity,"Britain’s leading free-market thinktanks, which backed Margaret Thatcher’s tax-cutting and privatisation agenda and sanctioned the last 10 years of austerity, have lent their support to the government’s plans for unprecedented and sustained increases in public spending. In a shift of stance that will give Rishi Sunak political clearance to ramp up UK debts to levels not seen in peacetime, the Adam Smith Institute, the Centre for Policy Studies, the Institute of Economic Affairs and Policy Exchange said they endorsed public spending increases to confront the coronavirus outbreak and state-funded investment to boost the recovery. The support for widespread state intervention to rescue the economy came as Boris Johnson told backbench Tory MPs there were no plans to impose a public sector wage freeze or other austerity measures to bring down public spending in the crisis. In a call to around 125 members of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, the Daily Telegraph reported that the prime minister said there was “no question” of a return to austerity, and assured them he would “double down” on funding transport projects in the north of England. Johnson addressed MPs after a leaked Treasury memo revealed that some officials were putting in place detailed plans for spending cuts to arrest a public sector deficit expected to climb by at least £300bn this year. Britain is expected to enter a deep recession following the lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent body responsible for forecasting the public finances, showed the economy suffering a 35% decline in output between April and the end of June and a rise in unemployment to at least 10%. The cost of measures such as the Treasury’s furlough scheme, which has paid employers to send home over 7 million workers, will send the public spending deficit above 15% this year, 50% higher than the worst period following the 2008 crash. Left-leaning thinktanks and academics have lined up to condemn plans for a return to austerity, saying it would harm the recovery, and adding that further government borrowing would be needed to secure a return to growth after the virus-induced mothballing of the economy.
During the last recession, most free market thinktanks buttressed austerity measures imposed by the then chancellor George Osborne, arguing that the public sector deficit should be quickly reduced. Warwick Lightfoot, chief economist at Policy Exchange, said: “I don’t think anyone is arguing for a relaunch of austerity. Even an austerity hawk believes it is different this time. “The last thing you want to do is amplify the prospects of a full-blown depression,” he added. Policy Exchange, founded in 2002 by Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office chief, Tory peer Francis Maude, former MP Nick Boles and businessman Archie Norman, has a loyal following in the cabinet and has claimed to be behind several recent Tory policies. Lightfoot said low interest rates meant the government could borrow cheaply to invest in infrastructure to get the economy back on its feet. Matthew Lesh, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute, founded in the 1970s to promote free-market policies, said: “Even fiscally hawkish people have less of a problem with the current increase in debt levels.” Tom Clougherty, head of tax at the Centre for Policy Studies, said: “I’d usually be wary of big public investment schemes In the current circumstances, though, with borrowing costs very low and little prospect of crowding out private investment, I think the pros outweigh the cons.” The CPS was founded in the 1970s to combat socialism by former MP Keith Joseph, a close friend and supporter of Margaret Thatcher.
Echoing left-leaning economists, Lesh said the Bank of England should support the government with loose monetary policy, allowing it to borrow at low interest rates. Julian Jessop, an economics fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs – a thinktank founded in the 1950s with the support of free-market economist Friedrich Hayek – said that he was relaxed about the debts built up during the worst of the lockdown. “There are obvious risks that austerity will restrict growth,” he said. But he was concerned that the government would harm the economy by keeping restrictions on business activity for much of the year, which would delay a bounce-back in economic growth. “The longer the economy is kept shuttered, the greater the risk that more of the damage will be permanent, making it that much harder to pay for better public services and infrastructure in the future,” he said. The four thinktanks continue to believe the Treasury should examine tax-cutting measures to promote innovation and entrepreneurial activity, saying that over the longer term, Whitehall was poor at allocating funds to the economy in the most effective way."
2020-05-16T19:11:20Z,politics,Politics,Lansman to step down as Momentum chair but remain on Labour NEC,"Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum, the grassroots organisation set up in 2015 to support the left wing of the Labour party under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, has announced he will step down from his role as chair of the group. Writing on the Labour List website, Lansman â€“ who will remain a member of Labourâ€™s national executive committee (NEC) â€“ declared it was time for a new generation of leaders to campaign for socialist policies and to put their ideas into practice, as he revealed he would not stand in internal Momentum elections in June.
The veteran political activist called for better governance within Labour, and demanded â€œjustice for sabotageâ€� and for the alleged misuse of funds, as well as for â€œracist, sexist, ableist and frankly McCarthyite attitudesâ€� that he claimed the leaked report into the party documented. â€œWe are now a mass of dedicated activists fighting for a better world,â€� he wrote. â€œAnd in this new era, it is time that a new generation of leaders put their ideas into practice. That is why I have decided not to contest the forthcoming elections within Momentum and instead will hand over to a new leadership.â€� He continued: â€œWe desperately need better governance in our party, as the leaked report has further demonstrated. Members need justice for sabotage, misuse of funds, plus racist, sexist, ableist and frankly McCarthyite attitudes. â€œBut we must also make sure that the partyâ€™s machinery never again returns to those days of anti-democratic stitch-ups, factional warfare, and toxic culture.â€� The longtime campaigner, who studied economics at Cambridge in the 1970s, notably worked on Corbynâ€™s campaign for the party leadership in 2015 which culminated in the unlikely return of a socialist to the role. He wrote that upon Corbyn becoming leader, socialists were few in the Labour party, but â€œtoday we are manyâ€� and there was â€œreal cause amongst us for hope and confidenceâ€�. Lansman added: â€œIn 2017, with an incredibly popular socialist manifesto, we achieved the biggest swing to Labour since 1945. Promising to restore public ownership and end austerity, we came within just 2,500 votes across a handful of constituencies from forming a government.â€� He credited the movement around Corbyn, bolstered by Momentumâ€™s grassroots campaigning and viral videos, for forcing Labour to â€œnever again be the party of illegal invasions, anti-immigration mugs or support for Tory policies of austerity and privatisationâ€�. However, he lamented that the NEC was unfit for purpose and said it needed to be given greater powers to provide adequate scrutiny and oversight over the party and its leadership. It comes after he was campaign chief of Rebecca Long-Baileyâ€™s unsuccessful run for leadership, in which she lost out to Keir Starmer. Long-Bailey tweeted Lansman her best wishes, describing him as a â€œtireless voice for Labour party democracyâ€�.
Angela Rayner, the partyâ€™s deputy leader, also tweeted to wish Lansman all the best, calling him â€œa true socialistâ€� who â€œhas fought injustice and inequality and will continue to do soâ€�.
Of the attempts â€“ sometimes controversial â€“ to reselect parliamentary candidates in certain constituencies by leftwing activists, Lansman wrote: â€œWe didnâ€™t succeed in democratising the party sufficiently while Jeremy was leader, but we must not give up now. Itâ€™s now more important than ever that Labour becomes a grassroots member-led movement.â€� Acknowledging he had made mistakes and had some regrets â€“ without revealing what they were â€“ Lansman said the struggle for an equal and environmentally sustainable world would continue, though there has been speculation about whether Momentum can survive Corbynâ€™s departure. â€œI shall stay around to support my successors in Momentum,â€� he said. â€œI shall continue to speak out, even when some would rather I didnâ€™t.â€� He added that he would return to blogging and focus his attentions on Labourâ€™s national executive committee. A spokesperson for Momentum thanked Lansman for his years of dedication to the Labour party, saying: â€œHe has done an incredible amount to transform the politics of this country. He has played a key role in building Labour into a half-a-million-member party and strengthening the movement for socialism in Britain. â€œWe look forward to working with him as he continues to lead from the left on the NEC and across the movement.â€� The Forward Momentum campaign, which set out last month to â€œrefoundâ€� and â€œdemocratiseâ€� Momentum, said it was pleased Lansman had recognised it was time for a new generation to take the organisation forward. â€œWe need to put an end to stitch-ups, and candidates or slates being chosen behind closed doors in London,â€� it said in a statement. â€œWe need Momentum to be a truly member-led organisation that campaigns to transform the Labour party and supports trade unions and social movements in their struggles for social and economic justice.â€�"
2020-05-16T12:42:10Z,politics,Politics,Home Office failure to scrap NHS migrant surcharge sparks anger,"Anger is growing over the government’s failure to abolish the surcharge many migrant healthcare workers must pay to access the NHS, after Priti Patel suggested it was under review three weeks ago. It has emerged that the Home Office did not specifically review the charges beyond exempting on a one-year extraordinary basis both those whose visas were due to expire before October from that fee and the £400 surcharge, which will rise to £625 a year each later this year. The department faces renewed condemnation for not permanently scrapping the charge after the deaths of several migrant NHS workers during the coronavirus crisis. “We have repeatedly called for the immigration health surcharge to be waived for nursing staff,” a spokesperson from the Royal College of Nursing said. “They are already contributing through taxes and national insurance – to ask them to pay twice is simply wrong. “This charge must be stopped. Following her announcement that the charge was being reviewed, we wrote to the home secretary urging action. We await a response and commitment to act on this.” Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) council, told the Independent: “In the last two months, we’ve seen a huge outpouring of support for our frontline staff, including those talented colleagues who have come to work here from overseas. “I’m sure they would be dismayed to find that the government is continuing to penalise them with this absurd fee during the crisis.”
The shadow health minister, Justin Madders, said the NHS would collapse without overseas staff and that it was “simply unconscionable” for them to be subject to extra charges. “Ministers frequently tell us how proud they are of the incredible effort being made by NHS staff yet when they have the opportunity to do something tangible to demonstrate their appreciation they pull the rug up,” he said. The Home Office tweeted on Saturday afternoon: “It is wrong to suggest the home secretary said there would be a formal review into this policy. All government policies are continuously kept under review.” After Patel’s apparent announcement, there were mounting calls for the surcharge to be permanently ditched. It was introduced in 2015 as part of hostile environment laws designed to discourage illegal immigration and combat health tourism. The surcharge must be paid alongside taxes and national insurance contributions. Dr Chandra Kanneganti, the national chair of the British International Doctors Association, said: “We know BAME doctors are disproportionately getting ill. To have to pay for the same service that they are putting their lives at risk for doesn’t seem fair. This charge needs to be scrapped completely for NHS overseas workers.” The Home Office said the surcharge raised about £900m for the NHS between 2015 and 2018-19. During this time the cost has repeatedly risen and healthcare workers have said they struggled to pay the fees. For other doctors and nurses, the charges are probably a deterrent when they consider coming to the UK. At the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing last month, Patel said in response to a detailed question from ITV regarding the surcharge: “We have a range of measures that are, like most things in government, under review, and we are looking at everything including visas, surcharge … We are looking at everything we can do to continue to support everyone on the frontline in the NHS.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “As the home secretary said, in light of the exceptional circumstances that coronavirus presents, it is right that policies are kept under review. “This includes how the immigration health surcharge applies. For example, the Home Office has already announced free automatic visa extensions for overseas frontline NHS workers who are working to beat the virus, including an exemption from the immigration health surcharge.”"
2020-05-15T17:56:11Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus live: Matt Hancock defends easing lockdown as R number shown to be close to 1  - as it happened,"The UKâ€™s R rate is still dangerously close to one, having risen in the past week to between 0.7 and 1, bringing lockdown-easing moves into question. An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which wold result in a second wave of cases. The latest data from Sage is based on the levels of transmission from two to three weeks ago, calling into question whether England should be easing its lockdown restrictions just yet. More than a quarter of all care home deaths in England and Wales since the beginning of the crisis involved Covid-19, data from the ONS revealed. In the period from 2 March to 1 May, there were 45,899 registered deaths of care home residents in England and Wales, 12,526 (27.3%) of which involved the virus. All care home residents and staff in England will be tested for Covid-19 by early June, the health secretary announced. It came as Matt Hancock outlined plans for a Â£600m funding boost for the social care sector, after the government came under fierce criticism this week for acting too slowly to contain the spread of the virus in care homes. The Welsh government published its roadmap for easing the lockdown in Wales, keeping the â€˜stay homeâ€™ message in place for another two weeks. The traffic light system will move from lockdown into the â€œfirst cautious stepâ€� of the red zone, then the amber zone, and finally the green zone. The traffic light categories will apply to different aspects of daily life and activities, which may well happen at different rates. Schools in Wales will not fully reopen before September, Mark Drakeford confirmed. But he said the ambition remained for some cohorts of children to return to school before the summer holidays. Transport for London is to raise the congestion charge by 30% to secure a Â£1.6bn government bailout after it took a 90% hit to its revenue due to the pandemic. The capitalâ€™s congestion charge of Â£11.50 will be reimposed from Monday, as will the separate Â£12.50 charge imposed on vehicles with high emissions entering central London. This will rise to Â£15 from 22 June, with enforcement extended from weekdays to the whole week and for longer hours. Free travel for under-18s will also be temporarily suspended, so too for people over 60 or with a disability during peak hours. â€œVery little progressâ€� has been made in the latest round of Brexit talks, the UKâ€™s chief negotiator said. David Frost said the EUâ€™s demands on a level playing field for trade was â€œthe major obstacleâ€�. Thatâ€™s it from the UK today.

2020-05-15T17:06:39Z,politics,Politics,"Lib Dem election campaign a 'car crash', says party's review","The Liberal Democrat election campaign last year was “a high-speed car crash” worsened by structural failures, poor tactics, and an inexperienced inner circle around Jo Swinson, an internal party review has concluded. The 61-page report, led by the Lib Dem peer Dorothy Thornhill, says an already hugely difficult campaign was further hampered by errors including hubris over the number of seats the party could win. Despite pre-election predictions from some Lib Dems of gains of 80 or 100 MPs, the 12 December election saw the party slump from its defection-fuelled tally of 21 MPs to just 11, with Swinson among those losing their seats. The report notes that while Swinson was hampered by having less than five months between winning the party leadership and the election, her decision to immediately seek a new party chief executive undermined decision-making structures. “This had the unintended consequence creating an ‘inner circle’ of advisers at arm’s length from the resources of the party machine, and put decision-making in the hands of an unaccountable group around the leader,” the report says. “It also severed some people from the roles and responsibilities they were employed to do, and led to the overpromotion of others.” The report, based in part on almost 21,000 survey responses from Lib Dem members and officials, said Swinson’s tactic of promising to revoke Brexit if the party won a parliamentary majority meant the party “effectively ignored” the biggest group of voters: those who were neither fervently remain or leave. While painting a picture of a party almost drunk on the euphoria of initially high poll ratings and unable to detect that the picture had shifted, the report stresses the role of both a dysfunctional internal structure and what was always going to be a difficult election. “The overarching conclusion of the review is that had we made much better decisions in 2019, we might have gained a few more seats, but not many more,” it says. The Lib Dems’ current interim leader, Ed Davey, praised the report as brave and powerful, saying in a series of tweets that in future the party should be “rooted in our communities, putting the interest of our communities first, and we need to speak with a clear voice”. The report identifies as one key moment the release of a poll before Swinson took over as leader, amid the peak of the Brexit chaos under Theresa May, which put the Lib Dems on 73 seats and within a 5% swing of 219 more. This prompted the abandonment of plans to fight 32 potential new seats as serious targets in favour of a list that rose to 40 and then 80, despite worries from activists about a lack of resources to battle on so many fronts. The expectations swelled towards the party’s hugely buoyant autumn conference, and then an election launch at which Swinson was presented as a potential prime minister. This happened, the report noted, despite worrying signs, such as Labour backing a second Brexit referendum. The party, concluded the report, suffered from “an optimism that was to maintain itself even when the evidence started to turn against it”. Before the election was called, the report says, the party faced two unpalatable choices: ally with Labour to stop Brexit, but risk a collapse in tactical voting from Tory voters alarmed by Jeremy Corbyn; or delay an election for as long as possible, even if Brexit took place. “Instead we chose to claim to believe we could win outright ourselves, thus obviating the need to choose,” it says. “It is this lack of clarity which led to an election campaign that can only be described as a high-stakes gamble for a once-in-a-lifetime election, to stop Brexit by winning outright. It was a gamble which did not pay off.” The election, which the report summarised as “a high-speed car crash”, was marked by poor on-the-ground campaigning, as exemplified by the loss of Swinson’s East Dunbartonshire seat, and a central message that Swinson could be PM which “appeared unrealistic to the wider public, especially given that we were already falling in the polls”."
2020-05-15T16:59:08Z,politics,Politics,London congestion charge rise down to good old power struggle,"Good old-fashioned politics rather than economic, environmental or health considerations seem to explain the decision by Transport for London to reimpose the congestion charge from Monday, hike it by 30% next month, and to also restrict free travel for the young, the elderly and the disabled.
Put simply, a power struggle is taking place between London’s Labour mayor and TfL on one side of the table and a Conservative government on the other. The row is about the size and the strings attached to a government bailout needed because of the massive drop in numbers using public transport in the capital. Stuck in the middle are the citizens of the capital, many of whom are already struggling to make ends meet. The congestion charge was originally introduced to make London’s traffic flow more freely and the air cleaner. It was suspended at the start of the lockdown in the hope that car travel would help keep the capital ticking over, especially by making it easier for key workers, including nurses, to drive to work. In recent days the government has urged workers to use cars to travel wherever possible, because it is currently safer than public transport. It is also encouraging cycling and walking. The mayor also wants Londoners to stay away from public transport. He wants them to walk, cycle, or stay at home, but not use cars. TfL says its cash crisis means it has no choice but to reintroduce the congestion charge from Monday and to raise it from £11.50 a day to £15 next month. Older and dirtier vehicles will also have to pay the Ulez (ultra-low emission zone) charge of £12.50 a day, which has also been suspended in lockdown. The basic laws of economics suggest that whacking up the congestion charge provides an incentive to find other ways of getting around. But the continuing need for social distancing means there isn’t the capacity on the tubes and buses to take more than a fraction of London’s usual workforce.
The second option is to follow the example of cities such as Amsterdam, where people cycle and walk more than they do in London. Amsterdam, though, has a population a tenth the size of London. It is often not feasible for low-paid workers, forced to live in the less expensive outer boroughs of London, to get to work on their bikes (even assuming they have one). The third option is to suck it up and pay the higher congestion charge. But many of London’s workers – the builders, shopworkers, delivery drivers, plumbers, midwives and security guards – are not highly paid. For them, the stand off between City Hall and Westminster means putting their health at risk or seeing a bigger slice taken out of their already low incomes."
2020-05-15T16:58:08Z,politics,Politics,Labour welcomes PM's 'conversion' on obesity after coronavirus scare,"Labour has hailed a “welcome conversion” by Boris Johnson as Downing Street confirmed that the prime minister hopes to lead a public health drive, having blaming his stint in intensive care on obesity. The prime minister was hospitalised with coronavirus last month and spent several nights in intensive care at St Thomas’s hospital in London. Several slimmer colleagues, including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, escaped with milder symptoms. Asked about reports that Johnson had joked with aides that “thinnies” are not as prone to the worst effects of the coronavirus and now wants to lead a “war on fat”, his official spokesman said: “As we outlined in our recovery strategy, this government will invest in preventive and personalised solutions to ill health, helping people to live healthier and more active lives. “You have heard the PM speak on a number of occasions about the importance he attaches to cycling.” The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said: “We’ve repeatedly warned of the long-term health risks of obesity. If the prime minister now supports extending the sugar tax and banning junk food advertising before the watershed, then that’s a welcome conversion. We are facing an obesity crisis, and decisive action is urgently needed.” However, No 10 denied that Johnson was considering increasing the sugar tax – the levy imposed by George Osborne to encourage food companies to reformulate their products. That would have been be a considerable turnaround from Johnson’s stance during last year’s Tory leadership contest, when he announced a moratorium on “sin taxes”, claiming that they hit the poorest consumers hardest.
Johnson has generally been against “nanny state” interventions in the public’s daily lives, an instinct some critics blamed for the government’s reluctance to take draconian lockdown measures in the early stages of the coronavirus crisis. The government has not so far enacted plans set out in a green paper on preventive health in the final days of Theresa May’s premiership, which included consulting on a ban on junk food advertising before 9pm. Early research has suggested that obesity may be a significant factor in determining the severity of Covid-19 cases. Johnson’s spokesman said the government was examining the importance of this and other criteria. “It is critical to understand how factors such as ethnicity, deprivation, age, gender and obesity could be disproportionately impacting how people are affected by coronavirus,” he said. “Public Health England launched a review into the factors affecting health outcomes from coronavirus, to include ethnicity, gender and obesity, and this will be published by the end of May,” he added. The outcome could help the government tailor its advice to different groups during the coming months as the search for a vaccine continues. Several officials have said Johnson is entirely serious about the plan to improve public health, and is particularly focused on pushing through plans to get more people walking and cycling. One issue with this has been to ensure local authorities take the necessary action, but if central government provides financial support to regional transport systems, as has happened with Transport for London, the hope is that pressure can be exerted for rapid progress. As well as improving public health, the government is keen to ensure that as many people as possible who are returning to work as the lockdown eases avoid public transport.
The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, announced the allocation of £2bn of his department’s budget last week for creating “emergency” cycle lanes, widening pavements and other interventions aimed at encouraging the public to get around using “active travel”."
2020-05-15T14:53:10Z,politics,Politics,British negotiator gives EU two-week deadline to drop 'ideological' stance,"Britain’s chief negotiator in the talks over the future relationship with the EU has warned Michel Barnier that he must drop his “ideological approach” within the next fortnight, as the latest round of talks ended in stalemate. The comments from David Frost came as both sides offered a gloomy prognosis for the negotiations on trade, security and fisheries, with little sign of the teams finding common ground. Frost said there had been “very little progress” in the latest discussions between the two sides, adding that he found it “hard to understand why the EU insists on an ideological approach which makes it more difficult to reach a mutually beneficial agreement”. A UK source described the talks as tetchy at times, with just six weeks to go before a legally binding deadline by which a decision must be made on extending the transition period beyond 2020. The British government has previously said it could be forced to refocus its attention away from the negotiations and towards preparing the country for a no-deal outcome if significant progress has not been made by 1 July. In his statement at the end of the latest round of video-conference negotiations, Frost said: “We very much need a change in EU approach for the next round beginning on 1 June. “In order to facilitate those discussions, we intend to make public all the UK draft legal texts during next week so that the EU’s member states and interested observers can see our approach in detail. “The UK will continue to work hard to find an agreement, for as long as there is a constructive process in being, and continues to believe that this is possible.” Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator since July 2016, told reporters in a virtual press conference that the round of talks had been “very disappointing”, adding that he was not optimistic about the outcome. A key flashpoint remains the British insistence that it will not tie itself to common so-called level playing conditions on environmental, social and labour standards. Barnier accused the UK of trying to pick and choose parts of the EU single market, dismissing the government’s claims that it is seeking a typical free-trade agreement. “Every time we meet they say they would be happy to have a Canada-style agreement, but at the same time ... they ask for far more from us than is available under the Canadian model,” Barnier said, citing the UK’s desire for “virtually full freedom of movement” for short visits, maintenance of “existing arrangements” on electricity interconnection, as well as “broad and widespread” recognition of professional qualifications to enable British lawyers, accountants and auditors to work in the EU. “We are not going to bargain away our European values to the benefit of the British economy,” Barnier said. “Economic and trading fair play is not for sale. It is not ‘a nice to have’, it is ‘a must have’.” The former French minister also rejected Michael Gove’s recent suggestion, which sources said had been repeated during the latest round of talks, that the UK could accept some tariffs as “the price” of avoiding European standards. “Even if we are to get rid of 98%, 99% of tariffs and not 100% that we are proposing … we will require the same strong guarantees of a level playing field.” He also warned that such a detailed and “very sensitive negotiation” would take years and an extension of the transition period. Despite the downbeat tone, Barnier said the two sides were “not at the point of failure” and hinted compromise might be possible on the tortuous issue of fishing rights over the 100 species straddling British and EU waters. While the EU wants to maintain the status quo, the UK wants a big increase in its fishing catches from British waters. “We should be able to move away from these two respective very maximalist positions in order to work on all sorts of parameters between these two maximalist positions,” Barnier said, adding that the discussion was “perhaps the only positive outcome from this week”. But a senior UK source said the level playing field demands were a red line and there could be no “halfway house” on the issue as it would result in EU laws being “imposed” on the UK. There is now a working assumption on the UK side that it will take a summit between Boris Johnson and the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in mid-June to break the impasse. In a further sign of the more aggressive approach of the UK under Johnson’s premiership, British negotiators also accused the European commission of obstructing progress on services, where they said discussions had been moving faster than in other areas. Barnier denied accusations of such tactics as “spin”, reiterating that the EU wanted all areas of the talks to progress at the same time. “Parallelism is a condition for progress,” he said. “It is not a tactic.” The UK Institute of Directors said it was “worrying to hear how far apart things are, given how little road there is left”, with its head of Europe and trade policy, Allie Renison, warning of the “much bigger consequences for business on both sides of the channel” if talks fail."
2020-05-15T08:21:11Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit: 'serious risk' EU will fail to protect UK citizens, says Gove","The British government has said there is “a serious risk” that the European Union will fail to meet its duties to protect the rights of UK nationals living in the bloc, in the latest sign of tensions over Brexit. In a letter to the European commission, Michael Gove said British residents living in the EU had raised concerns, while the coronavirus pandemic had diverted the attention of many governments from implementing the Brexit withdrawal agreement, which is intended to protect the rights of an estimated 1.2 million British nationals in the EU and 3.5 million Europeans in the UK. There is “a serious risk that the EU will not fulfil its obligations under the withdrawal agreement by the time the transition period ends on 31 December 2020”, said Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He added that the government was “already seeing several instances of misapplication of the withdrawal agreement”, which, although “localised incidents”, made it harder for British nationals to exercise their rights. The letter comes at a tense moment in EU-UK relations, with both sides expected to report later on the latest round of talks, which conclude on Friday morning. One of the government’s criticisms is the lack of official campaigns in EU member states to raise awareness about new requirements for UK nationals – a stipulation under the treaty. France and Spain, home to large numbers of UK migrant workers and retired people, are deemed not to have done anything proactive to raise awareness among British residents. The Czech Republic and Hungary have published information that the UK government believes to be confusing or out-of-date, without translation into English. In contrast – the government says – information on the settlement scheme for EU nationals in the UK is available in other EU languages. In Austria and Slovenia the government is concerned British nationals have only six or seven months to secure their rights, whereas EU nationals in the UK have 27 months. Other EU member states, such as Malta, Cyprus and Slovakia, are faulted for relying on face-to-face meetings with local officials, rather than offering people the option to secure their status online. Gove complains that some countries have still not provided detail on what their application processes will entail. The government is also concerned about limited attention to vulnerable UK citizens, with Gove stating that member states have not shared information about help for elderly, hard-to-reach or other vulnerable citizens, adding that “in many cases there appears to be none”. In contrast the government says the UK has given £9m to help community organisations support vulnerable EU nationals, with a further £8m due in 2020-21. It also reports £3m earmarked to help support British nationals in the EU. Gove represents the government in the Joint Committee, an EU-UK group set up to monitor compliance and implement the Brexit withdrawal treaty, which came into force when the UK left the EU on 31 January. The letter is addressed to his opposite number, the European commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič. While EU governments are responsible for protecting citizens’ rights, the government has called on the commission – the ultimate enforcer of EU law – to step in. The letter echoes some complaints made by European politicians over the treatment of EU nationals in the UK. The government revealed last month it had received 3.4m applications from people seeking to stay in the EU through the settled status scheme. The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he had paid “close attention” to Gove’s letter. While he did not say whether he shared the British government’s analysis of the problems facing British citizens, he promised the commission would be vigilant, adding that guidance had been published for national authorities to implement the citizens’ rights part of the withdrawal agreement. “We will do the necessary dialogue with each of the member states concerned,” he told reporters. • This article was amended on 20 May 2020. An earlier version stated that “the Czech Republic and Hungary have published information that is thought to be confusing or out-of-date”. This has been amended to clarify that this is the UK government’s assessment."
2020-05-14T23:01:22Z,politics,Politics,"May and Johnson hung civil servants out to dry, report finds","Theresa May and Boris Johnson let the former chief Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins and other civil servants hang out to dry after they became “targets for political attacks”, an investigation into Whitehall’s role in the Brexit drama of the past four years has found. The independent thinktank the Institute for Government (IfG) spent months talking in confidence to Whitehall sources including officials, ministers and special advisers, to shine a light on the behind-the-scenes experience of some of those involved in one of the most controversial chapters in British political history. Among the moments highlighted by the study was when Johnson put civil servants in an “immensely difficult position” last October when he threatened to leave the EU without a deal in breach of the Benn Act. “Under the civil service code 33, civil servants cannot help ministers break the law,” says its report, The Civil Service After Brexit. On a more prosaic level it also reveals the difficult decision-making and sheer exhaustion suffered by officials in the run-up to the first Brexit deadline of 29 March last year. It tells of civil servants “huddling round” a single printout of a complex and lengthy no-deal tariff schedule because of anxiety about leaks, of staff having to go to dark rooms to access documents on secure computers, and how a generous offer of “firebreak” holiday after the second no-deal deadline on 12 April 2019 led to droves quitting their jobs unable to face a return to the Brexit bedlam. But the study also found that the task of delivering Brexit “exposed weaknesses in the civil service”, with both ministers and officials failing to be upfront about the “severe political, and economic consequences no deal could have in Northern Ireland”.
Maddy Thimont Jack, senior researcher at the Institute for Government, said: “Brexit demonstrated the very best of the civil service. It managed to unpick a 47-year relationship with the EU in less than three years, working under immense pressure and to extremely tight timelines. But the task is still not complete and the tensions that Brexit exposed – particularly, between ministers and officials – have not necessarily gone away.” Those who spoke to the thinktank heavily criticised May’s relationship with the civil service. She did not offer any “significant protection” to Robbins after he was openly attacked by hardline Brexiters, accused of “freelancing” and peddling a pro-EU line in Brussels.
“The prime minister was notably silent: she offered no support to her key adviser, who was taking personal and professional attacks as a result of her policy decisions,” the report notes. The former head of HMRC Jon Thompson received two death threats after he said May’s “maximum facilitation” border proposals would cost businesses up to £20bn a year. Instead of defending his position as the widely respected chief civil servant at the HMRC, May let her spokesman dismiss Thompson’s analysis as “speculation”. The report concludes that the near breakdown of May’s government and lack of clarity left civil servants trying to build consensus through “tried and tested methods of ambiguous wording and ingenious drafting” something familiar to fans of the TV sitcom Yes Minister. Johnson also used the weapon of silence when civil servants came under attack, the IfG found. Most notably, he refused to defend the UK’s ambassador to Washington, Sir Kim Darroch, when diplomatic emails about Donald Trump’s administration were leaked. Johnson was frontrunner for the Tory party leadership at the time. “Excessive secrecy on Brexit” was another complaint from inside Whitehall with the “over-classification” of documents as “secret” creating unnecessary problems for civil servants. Officials had to rely on super-secure Rosa terminals, put in place by the National Cyber Security Centre, rather than their own computers. “Secrecy caused a lot of unnecessary stress in the run-up to 29 March 2019, with far too few people having access to vital documents. The concerns were leaks – but throughout this period it was mainly the political teams in departments, not officials working on Brexit readiness or negotiations, that were responsible for leaking,” the report says.
Vast improvements were made under Michael Gove when he was appointed as head of exit operations (XO) and no-deal planning, the authors conclude. With a dashboard involving 350 milestones and secrecy levels dropped, the new body is said to have moved swiftly “more like a programme management board … than a cabinet committee”. Ultimately the pace was unsustainable and its focus was narrow: to avert the immediate chaos of crashing out of the EU rather than the longer term consequence for the country. But for its flaws, it proved a model that was easily adjusted and used to effect in the coronavirus response, mixing officials and ministers on a cross-departmental basis, the study found."
2020-05-14T19:32:57Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus live: Britain claps for carers on the Covid frontline - as it happened,Iâ€™m closing our UK live blog for the day. Thanks so much for joining us. Please follow our global live blog for all further developments this evening.
2020-05-14T19:18:19Z,politics,Politics,"England's Covid-19 infection rate too high for further easing, experts say","Ministers and scientists are nervous about how far they will be able to ease the lockdown in England at the end of the month, as it emerged that the country needed to more than halve its daily infection rate of around 10,000 new cases a day. A new study from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggested that one in 400 people had the virus outside hospitals and care homes over the past two weeks, described by Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, as “very low” circulation in the community. However, getting the daily infection rate below 5,000 – or even 4,000 – is a main factor in decision-making about lockdown-lifting measures such as opening schools and some shops from 1 June. Two senior government sources said there were still doubts about whether enough progress would be made to allow the reopening of parts of the economy or permit more social contact through the idea of “household bubbles” in the coming weeks. The ONS data, the first national snapshot of Covid-19 rates, also showed children were as likely to catch coronavirus as adults, and that frontline healthcare workers were much more likely to contract it than the general population. It estimated that 148,000 people in England were infected with the virus over the past two weeks, amounting to 0.27% of the population. The figures do not include people in hospital or care homes, where rates of Covid-19 infection – and possibly transmission – are likely to be higher.
The Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) discussed expert reports on “bubbles” at a meeting on Thursday, including the New Zealand model of two households joining together to include close family, bring in caregivers, or support isolated people. Evidence from behavioural experts looked at whether it could cause discrimination, how to communicate the policy and how enforceable it would be. In relation to hitting the 1 June lockdown easing date, there remain serious worries about the prevalence of the virus in care homes and hospitals, different levels of infection throughout the country, and whether the contact-tracing and testing regime will be fully up and running. “There is still a lot of uncertainty about how far we will be able to do it,” one senior Whitehall source said. Boris Johnson said in his report on Monday that an easing of the lockdown would be conditional on enough progress being made by 1 June, but his address to the nation raised hopes that some aspects of life could get back to relative normality – albeit with physical distancing – in just two weeks’ time. One of the main deciding factors is whether the daily infection rate falls below 5,000, although some experts believe below 4,000 would be better. A study by Public Health England and the University of Cambridge looking at various models has said the rate could be as high as 11,000 a day. Another major factor is whether the “R rate” of reproduction remains substantially below 1. Sage experts are understood to be looking to publish a range for the R rate on a more consistent basis from next week to increase transparency of the figure, which is sometimes referred to in press conferences but not regularly released. The latest estimate was 0.6 to 0.9. The PHE/Cambridge analysis suggests that transmission rates in London are currently far lower than some other regions, with the study suggesting that there could be as few as 24 new cases each day and an R rate of 0.4. The ONS study tested 10,705 people in more than 5,000 households and suggested about 148,000 people across the entire population would have tested positive on any day between 27 April and 10 May 2020. Experts suggest the current rates of infection remain “some way off” what would be needed to lift the lockdown. The results are likely to fuel concerns about the risk of opening primary schools on 1 June. No evidence was found of differences in the proportions testing positive between the age categories 2 to 19, 20 to 49, 50 to 69 and 70 years and over. The numbers testing positive in this first release were small – 33 in total – and so this picture could change and the figures are expected to be tracked closely over the next two weeks. The study revealed far higher infection rates among those working with patients in healthcare and those in social care roles, with 1.33% testing positive. Previous ONS figures suggested people working in social care in England and Wales were twice as likely to die with coronavirus as the general working-age population, but healthcare workers were no more likely to die than other workers.
Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the figures show “we’re still some way off getting to a point where we can relax restrictions a lot”. The latest figures would suggest a “crude estimate” of 10,000 new cases each day, according to Hunter. However, a more accurate calculation would take into account the average number of days over which a person would test positive and other factors. The current pilot phase of the ONS survey will be rolled out to cover up to 300,000 people over the next 12 months. From now on, weekly updates will be published including regional breakdowns. Azeem Majeed, a professor of primary care at Imperial College London, said the data suggest some previous studies, based on hospital admissions, may have underestimated the rates of infection in children. “Children usually have mild symptoms and therefore may not often need medical care. The next step will be to try to determine whether children are as likely as adults to infect other people,” he said."
2020-05-14T19:16:40Z,politics,Politics,Grants Shapps imitates Chris Tarrant to show the UK's out of lifelines | John Crace,"For the second time in six days Grant Shapps was asked to do front of house at the daily Downing Street press conference. Let that thought sink in for a moment. Given that Shapps is a man clearly out of his depth in a puddle, there can only be four explanations for this. Either the relatively competent ministers, such as Rishi Sunak and Matt Hancock, have said they’re going to work to rule from now on and limit their appearances. Or Boris Johnson knows there are so many duds in the cabinet – Where’s Priti? – that Shapps is the best he’s got. Or Grant has managed to convince Boris that he’s actually two separate people; that his alter ego of Michael Green is a real person. Or – and this is the most likely – the government has admitted defeat and has chosen to turn the briefing into a piece of Dadaist performance art. The coronavirus deconstructed through interpretive dance. Not that Shapps isn’t a trier. His natural level is as a salesman flogging dodgy cleaning appliances in the graveyard slot of an online shopping channel. But for the press briefings he has made an effort to up his game by doing his impersonation of Chris Tarrant on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Smile glued on, boundless enthusiasm and a huge round of applause for Emma from Walsall who will be going home tonight with a bumper prize of £2,000. Shapps began with the tricky terms and conditions of today’s coronavirus competition. Some 126,064 tests had been completed in the previous 24 hours. OK so some of them were on the same people and many of them were kits that had been mailed out, but it was still a new record for the show so could everyone please show their appreciation. The transport secretary then mentioned the daily death figure. This was very sad, he said. Though he didn’t sound particularly sad. Mostly because difficult, negative emotions aren’t in his repertoire. He didn’t want the audience to be sad. So how about another big shout out for the UK having the highest death toll in Europe? Just think of the commercial revenue that could generate if there were any businesses left with spare cash to spend on advertising. After a brief recap of the government’s new messaging service – Stay Alert because the guidelines of both to Stay at Home and Go Back to Work were thoroughly confusing – Shapps got stuck into the gameshow proper. He didn’t want anyone to go home unhappy, so how about thinking of all the cheerful things about the pandemic? With no one using the trains, Network Rail had had plenty of time to upgrade the infrastructure and was now well ahead of schedule on some projects. And with far fewer people using their cars, the road improvements to the A14 had been completed seven months early. Felix from Felixstowe, you will be going home with £16,000. Who wants to be a two billionaire? Shapps did. Which is why he was able to announce a special cash bonus for roads and rails, with £1.7bn dedicated just to filling potholes. At the back of the studio, the show’s producers had a minor heart attack. No one had told them Chris/Grant was going to start spending their money like this. Within minutes, the department of transport had had to issue a clarification. The minister had got a bit carried away. The £2bn wasn’t actually new money. He was merely re-announcing money that had already been promised. Still, no one would care by the time the show was repeated on ITV3. The starter questions from the public proved to be unusually tricky. Helen wanted to know whether universities would be going back in September and if her son should take out a £9k loan for an education he wasn’t going to get. Shapps grinned and commiserated. That’s a question he would like answered himself as he also had a son at university. Perhaps he could phone a friend. Predictably Gavin Williamson didn’t answer his call. Shapps also had to ask the audience when questioned about deaths in care homes as he didn’t have a clue what the answer was. Using Boris as your role model when preparing for a press conference is maybe not such a good idea. “Um in Europe, the death rate in care homes is 50%,” he said cheerfully. “But in the UK it was only 25%.” So if old people did their bit by dying a bit quicker, we would soon be as good as the Italians and Spanish. Can’t have Johnny Foreigner outperforming us on mortality figures. The rest of the presser was just as unilluminating. Shapps is a model of equal opportunities in not knowing anything about anything. He didn’t know about the antibody tests but he was pleased that it was a positive question. He likes positivity. He had no idea of how many elective operations had been cancelled, but as he had used up all his lifelines, could he just say he hoped it wasn’t really that many. Nor did he know quite what to do about bailing out Transport for London. Shapps is as bewildered as Boris that asking people to go back to work and social distancing are frequently mutually exclusively pastimes. “I’m going to answer this question head on,” he said confidently. Head on as in avoiding it completely. When it came to the big ticket question on camping and caravan holidays, Shapps chose to bank what he had got. He’d be going home with 33,614. Though the real figure was probably nearer 50,000. Just a shame it was the Covid-19 dead and not pounds sterling. • This article was amended on 19 May 2020. A reference to the UK as having “the highest [Covid-19] fatality ratings in Europe” was removed."
2020-05-14T14:32:15Z,politics,Politics,No 10 under pressure as it is revealed Whitehall chief had coronavirus,"No 10 is facing questions about why it did not disclose that Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK’s most senior civil servant, had coronavirus at about the same time as Boris Johnson, Chris Whitty and Matt Hancock were struck down with the illness. The revelation – many weeks after Sedwill was diagnosed – means that almost all the senior people in charge of the UK’s coronavirus response had the illness in late March or early April.
It raises particular questions about why Johnson allowed a crucial cabinet meeting to go ahead on Tuesday 24 March, one day after the lockdown was imposed, which was attended in person by Whitty, the chief medical officer, Hancock, the health secretary, and Sedwill, the cabinet secretary. Johnson, Hancock and Whitty confirmed they tested positive for the virus two days later. Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s chief adviser, was also later confirmed to have had coronavirus at about the same time.
Sedwill was working at home throughout his illness but No 10 did not reveal at the time that he had tested positive. When asked almost daily at briefings about the state of Sedwill’s health, Downing Street said he was “fine” or working as normal. Sedwill, who is also national security adviser, is the most powerful civil servant in Britain. Asked whether the public had been misled, Johnson’s official spokesman said that he personally only became aware recently that Sedwill had been ill and that the cabinet secretary had continued to work over that period. The spokesman did not have the exact dates that Sedwill had coronavirus but Civil Service World reported that he tested positive in April and was ill at about the same time as Johnson. Asked why Sedwill’s illness and the date he tested positive had been kept from the public, a Cabinet Office spokesman said: “After experiencing mild symptoms the cabinet secretary tested positive for coronavirus in April. In line with the government’s guidance, the cabinet secretary self-isolated. He continued to lead the civil service’s implementation of the government’s response to coronavirus throughout this period.” Downing Street has already been criticised for allowing daily press conferences to continue without physical distancing in place while the crisis was underway. In the last week of March, when the lockdown was imposed, Johnson, Hancock, Sedwill and Whitty all chose to attend in person.
Another senior figure to have had the virus at about that time was former scientific adviser Prof Neil Ferguson, whose modelling team at Imperial College influenced the decision to impose a lockdown."
2020-05-14T13:47:22Z,politics,Politics,No 10 rebukes Tory MPs over misleading Keir Starmer video,"Downing Street has rebuked Conservative MPs, including a minister, for sharing a video from a far-right Twitter account that falsely claimed Sir Keir Starmer obstructed the prosecution of grooming gang members when he led the Crown Prosecution Service. A Downing Street spokesman said the MPs, including Nadine Dorries, a health minister, had been spoken to by whips after sharing the misleading 22-second clip. The video was shared by Dorries as well as the Telford MP Lucy Allan and Maria Caulfield, who represents Lewes. All commented at what the video purported to show, with Dorries calling it “revealing”. The No 10 spokesman said: “These tweets have rightly been deleted. The MPs involved have been spoken to by the whips’ office and reminded of their responsibility to check the validity of information before they post on social media sites.” The clip, from 2013, falsely claims to show Starmer apparently recounting reasons why victims of grooming gangs might not be credible, talking about “the assumption that a victim of child sexual abuse will swiftly report what’s happened to them to the police; will be able to give a coherent, consistent account, first time; that they will not themselves have engaged in any offending or other behaviour; and that they will not have misused drugs or alcohol at any stage”. The original tweeter, who also regularly posts anti-Islam messages and other far-right content, titled the clip: “Keir Starmer explains why he didn’t prosecute grooming gangs when he was head of the Crown Prosecution Service.” However, a fuller version of the video shows this is completely misleading. Starmer is in fact explaining why he had changed the prosecution guidelines, to move away from “a number of assumptions, which didn’t withstand scrutiny”.
Allan wrote in her retweet: “This suggests a total failure to understand grooming, a dismissive attitude towards CSE [child sexual exploitation] victims and a belief that the victims brought it on themselves.” Caulfield retweeted the video with the message: “True face of the Labour leader #shameful.” Speaking during an online event with Welsh voters, Starmer said: “As I understand it, it’s a doctored video that has been shared. I understand Nadine Dorries deleted it, which is the right thing to do. It’s doctored, it’s false, it’s not true.” A Labour source said: “This is a doctored video tweeted by a far-right social media account. As a government minister, we hope Nadine Dorries acknowledges this and takes it down.” Dorries later did remove her tweet, as did Allan. However, Allan did not delete an earlier reply to another tweet referencing the video in which the MP said: “Unbelievable. This is what CSE victims were up against.” Caulfield appeared to delete her entire Twitter account. None has yet apologised for sharing the misleading message. As director of public prosecutions, Starmer ordered a wholesale restructuring of how the CPS dealt with grooming cases, saying the legal system had failed victims. The issue of grooming gangs and authorities failing to properly target abusers has been regularly used by far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson to campaign against Muslims. In 2017, Dorries retweeted a post from Robinson."
2020-05-14T09:58:16Z,politics,Politics,What's at stake in Britain's post-Brexit trade talks?,"British trade negotiators have been exceptionally busy this week. They are in formal talks with both the EU and the US, and on Wednesday the trade secretary, Liz Truss, announced negotiating objectives for talks with Japan. But what deals does Britain already have, and what will happen if it does not conclude an agreement with the EU by the end of the year?
So Britain – at least on current trade terms – has more to lose from the failure of the EU talks than it has to gain from the success of the US talks. But it would also be wrong to imagine that Britain could just turn its back on Europe and conduct all its business with the US instead. The UK imports a large amount of fresh food, particularly from the Netherlands. Currently this produce can be shipped to Britain quickly and lorries carrying it pass directly through ports with minimal bureaucracy. Increased customs procedures and tariffs would make this trade more difficult, and getting fresh lettuces across the Atlantic has its own challenges. Currently, Britain’s trade with the US has a very strong services component. Trade in services (such as financial and legal services) are relatively unaffected by customs procedures or tariffs, but can be affected by mutual recognition of standards and qualifications. A beneficial deal with the US might therefore look quite different from a beneficial deal with the EU.

2020-05-13T20:02:12Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit will mean checks on goods crossing Irish Sea, government admits","The government has privately conceded there will be post-Brexit checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea, months after Boris Johnson insisted there would be no such trade barriers. In a letter to the executive office in Stormont the government confirmed there would be border control posts in three ports, Belfast, Warrenpoint and Larne. Declan Kearney, one of the two junior ministers in the executive office, the regional equivalent of the Cabinet Office in London, confirmed the details at a select committee session in Belfast on Wednesday. He told members of the local assembly that officials had briefed the executive on Monday. “The sum total of that, and without breaching executive confidentiality … [is that the] British government has confirmed it will urgently put in place detailed plans with the executive, which does include the physical posts at ports of entry,” said Kearney. The prime minister agreed checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain in a breakthrough meeting in Wirral with his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, last October. However he was then accused of misleading the public after he was recorded on video telling local businesses weeks later that there would be no checks. If any business was asked to fill in extra paperwork, they should telephone the prime minister “and I will direct them to throw that form in the bin”, he told them. The Northern Irish protocol is part of the withdrawal agreement signed in January after Johnson led the Conservative party to an 80-seat majority in December. It will kick in next year whether there is a deal on trade or not. The EU had become increasingly exasperated with Johnson’s claims that there would be no checks. Fears that the UK would backslide on the deal were fuelled by the refusal of Johnson’s government to allow the EU to open an office in Belfast to help implement and enforce the protocol. The paymaster general, Penny Mordaunt, told the EU such a presence would be “divisive in political and community terms”. The Brexit deal is unpopular across the political spectrum in Northern Ireland because of the extra costs and bureaucracy it will entail for businesses. But it also means checks on the border with the Republic of Ireland will be avoided, something that has the support of Sinn Féin, and that exporters will have access to both the domestic and EU single market. The South Down Sinn Féin MP, Chris Hazzard, has said the British government must live up to the commitments made on Brexit, particularly in relation to the Irish protocol. “The British government cannot be allowed to renege on their legal obligations and must now work with the EU and the executive to ensure those commitments are fulfilled as a matter of urgency,” he said. Business have called for some of the paperwork including the entry and exit declaration forms for imports and exports to be waived, along with health certificates for each product coming to a local supermarket. Analysis by the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium of deliveries from Britain to high-street supermarket chains in Northern Ireland found that firms could incur costs of more than £100,000 per lorry unless special Brexit derogations were agreed. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: “We have always been clear that there will be requirements for live animals and agri-food, building on what already happens at ports like Larne and Belfast. “We want to work with NI businesses and the executive to ensure new admin procedures are streamlined and efficient. The protocol puts legal obligations on both sides. We are committed to complying with ours, just as we expect the EU to comply with theirs.”"
2020-05-13T19:47:55Z,politics,Politics,"Raab's praise of UAE 'concerning', says pardoned British prisoner","Matthew Hedges, the UK citizen held for seven months by the United Arab Emirates, has accused the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, of being tone deaf after he described the Gulf state as a â€œtrue friend and valued partner of the UKâ€�. The foreign secretary made the remark after the UAE donated medical equipment to the UK, but Hedges said it was an example of how authoritarian countries use donations to garner diplomatic respectability. Hedges, a PhD student at the University of Durham, was detained on a false charge of espionage and held in solitary confinement for seven months by the UAE. In a letter to the Guardian, he said he he found Raabâ€™s remarks very difficult to swallow considering how little the Foreign Office had done to secure his release.
He added: â€œIt is further concerning that despite the UAE being clearly in opposition to the UKâ€™s goals in the conflicts in Libya and Yemen, the foreign secretary thinks that the UAE are valued partners who share the same diplomatic interests. â€œIt seems that not only does the UK government not value British lives abroad, it is happy to ignore terrible human rights abuses by regimes like the UAE, in order to deflect from their own failings during a global pandemic. â€œPerhaps the foreign secretary should push for arbitrarily detained British citizens to be released in the UAE and for a de-escalation in Libya and Yemen before choosing to thank the UAE so thoughtlessly.â€™â€� Hedges was arrested in May 2018 and charged with spying on behalf of the British government. In November he was sentenced to life imprisonment. After a political outcry in the UK, prompted by his wife, he was pardoned by the UAE President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The Foreign Office had advised Hedgesâ€™ family not to publicise his arrest, but instead rely on private diplomacy.
Hedges has two outstanding complaints with the Foreign Office â€“ one to the parliamentary ombudsman on how the Foreign Office failed in his view to come to his defence until his case was publicised, and a second with the information commissioner on how the Foreign Office has heavily redacted all the documents he requested under the Freedom of Information Act concerning the Foreign Officeâ€™s internal response to his arrest. The UAE is seen as one of the UK governmentâ€™s most valued partners in the middle east, but its increasingly active foreign policy has conflicted with the British stance in Libya. There, UAE groups in suspected breach of a United Nations arms embargo, have been aiding General Khalifa Haftar, the commander of the Libyan National Army, which has been seeking violently to usurp the UN recognised government in Tripoli. The UAE regards itself as a bulwark against the Muslim Brotherhood across the Middle East. The Foreign Office said in a statement: â€œThe UK has a strong history of protecting human rights and promoting our values globally. We continue to encourage the UAE to uphold international human rights obligations and promote regional stability. â€œFCO staff and ministers worked incredibly hard on Matthewâ€™s case and were delighted he was able to return to the UK.â€�"

2020-05-13T18:37:26Z,politics,Politics,"UK self-employed grant scheme attracts 110,000 claims in first hours","A government scheme to protect self-employed workers from financial hardship has received more than 110,000 claims in its first four hours of operation, the Treasury has said. The self-employment income support scheme (SEISS) forms a major part of the government’s economic rescue plans following the lockdown and was launched on Wednesday to help about 3.5 million people. The Treasury said it had moved quickly to implement the payments system after agreeing in March to supplement a subsidy for PAYE workers – which has paid for more than 7 million workers to stay at home on furlough – with a similar grant for the self-employed. By midday on Wednesday, HMRC had received 110,102 claims for grants worth 80% of average income after expenses, or £2,500 a month, after the tax authority sent notices to 3.5 million of the 5.2 million self-employed people it believes are eligible. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said in March the scheme would cover those earning up to £50,000, or 95% of the self-employed, and be “one of the most generous schemes anywhere in the world”. Under pressure from gig economy workers and other self-employed groups that had threatened to sue the government unless they were given parity with employed workers, he declared it would be available to those who made the majority of their income from self-employment, so only the “genuinely self-employed” would benefit. To minimise fraud, the Treasury insisted that only those who were already in self-employment and who had submitted a tax return for 2019 will be able to apply. IPSE, the lobby group for self-employed workers, said the launch was an “impressive logistical achievement” but criticised the continued exclusion of groups such as limited company contractors and the newly self-employed. IPSE’s chief executive, Derek Cribb, said: “For the self-employed, coronavirus is not only a health crisis, but also a pressing income crisis. That is why it is welcome that the government heeded our advice and created the admirable and vital SEISS. It is also excellent that the government has been able to open this early to many self-employed people in need.
“As the SEISS scheme rolls out to the self-employed, however, it is essential that we do not forget the groups that have not got the support they need out of this – such as the newly self-employed and those working through limited companies. We continue to urge the government to open out support schemes to these struggling groups,” he added. The Treasury said claimants would be able to make their claim on a specified date between 13-18 May, based on their unique tax reference (UTR) number and could expect to see the cash in bank accounts within six working days of each claim. HMRC has assigned eligible self-employed individuals a specific date to apply on and this can be checked on HMRC’s online checker. • This article was amended on 19 May 2020. The scheme pays self-employed workers 80% of their average monthly income after expenses, not of their “salaries” as an earlier version said."
2020-05-13T16:38:23Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson resorts to bluster under Starmer's cross-examination | John Crace,"On Monday Boris Johnson was singing the praises of “good old-fashioned British common sense”. A higher order of common sense than French or German common sense, naturally. So it’s unfortunate that this is the very quality he seems to singularly lack. Because you’d have thought the one thing Boris might have learned from his first time up against Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions last week was that it would be a help to come properly prepared. But Boris has never done preparation for anything. It’s not in his nature. Preparation is for girly swots. He is a tabula rasa who treats every day as a new beginning. One free from the consequences of any past actions. He is the macho blagger who has always been able to wing it, fuelled by a few gags and some hasty last-minute revision. Something that might have been good enough, when backed up by a full chamber of braying Tory MPs, to see off Jeremy Corbyn, but that is proving hopelessly inadequate against a top QC in a near-silent courtroom. Things are now so bad that every time Boris opens his mouth, he only encourages the jury to convict him and the judge to increase his sentence. It’s also possible that Starmer has made the same mistake as many people in severely overestimating Boris’s intelligence. That the long words and the Latin phrases simply cover up the fact the prime minister isn’t particularly bright: after all, it takes a very special type of cleverness to keep making the same mistakes over and over again. But then old habits die hard for the leader of the opposition too. He has learned from his time at the bar that there’s no such thing as having too much evidence against a defendant, so he was taking nothing for granted by coming to the Commons somewhat over-prepared. Give it time and Boris may well cut to the chase and just plead guilty in advance to save him the torture of answering six questions, but we’re not there yet, so Starmer opened his folder and asked the court to consider Exhibit A. Care homes. Was it not true that the government had been far too slow to act to protect the most vulnerable members of society? Absolutely not, Boris insisted. No country had done more to protect the elderly. What better protection could anyone get than being killed?
Hmm. That was weird, Starmer said, because in Exhibit B he had a surgeon quoted in the Daily Telegraph – citing the newspaper that up till now had been only too happy to print any old rubbish the prime minister writes was a cruel twist of the knife – saying that the government hadn’t changed its advice on releasing untested patients into care homes until mid-March. That’s not just true, Boris blustered, sounding guiltier by the second. Even though it was true. Though to accuse the prime minister of lying is to commit a philosophical category error. As Boris has no clue what advice his government has and hasn’t given, he can’t knowingly be untruthful. Nor, given his career track record, show any signs of being able to differentiate between truth and lies. Rather he just recites the answer that he wants to be true and hopes to make it so by willpower alone. And to be fair, it’s a tactic that’s worked often enough in the past. Starmer moved on to the Office for National Statistics figures for deaths in care homes. Their report suggested there had been an excess death figure of 18,000 people, yet the government was certain that only 8,000 of them had died of the coronavirus. So what did he think the other 10,000 had died of? Boris shrugged. It was a huge mystery. Perhaps some were dying of happiness. Or of over-exertion in the gym during lockdown? Or perhaps they were dying of disappointment that the UK still had not technically left the EU? “I’m baffled,” said Starmer. Baffled is QC speak for ‘Now I’ve got you nailed, you filthy lying toerag’. Baffled that the government had stopped using the international death rate comparison at the Downing Street press conference, having done so continuously for the past seven weeks. Boris blustered yet again. It turns out that a prime minister who was supposed to be such a great communicator can now barely talk in joined-up sentences. He has regressed to the pre-verbal stage. “Um … er … ah,” he mumbled. There was little left of the prime minister but a sodden mess by the time Keir had finished with him, though the SNP’s Ian Blackford was happy to make a few ripples of his own in the pool of blubbery sweat previously known as Boris. All that Johnson could say in his defence was that his was a roadmap of consensus – the consensus being that he hadn’t bothered to consult Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It appears he was surprised to learn there were so many people in London who needed to use public transport. In other times it might have been uplifting for the opposition benches to see the prime minister so comprehensively dismantled. But there was little cheering or a sense of satisfaction, because in a time of crisis you rather hope the country would have a leader in whom you could believe. Someone you could trust to make at least some of the right decisions. But we have Boris. Incompetent, unprepared, selfish, lazy, amoral, and just not that bright. And no matter how many times Starmer batters him with an indefensible charge sheet at PMQs, Boris will remain prime minister for the duration."
2020-05-13T15:32:21Z,politics,Politics,Speaker warns he will suspend Commons if distancing rules broken,"The Speaker of the House of Commons has said he will suspend parliament if physical distancing rules are breached in the Commons chamber – in effect ending government hopes that MPs can return to business as usual. It follows calls by the leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, on Tuesday night for all 650 MPs to return to Westminster to “set an example” to the rest of the country as the coronavirus lockdown is eased in England. The requirement for 2 metres between people means only 50 MPs can attend the chamber in person, while up to 120 can join proceedings remotely via Zoom. Rees-Mogg said he did not want to see the “hybrid” arrangements extended beyond the Whitsun recess, which ends on 2 June, and called for MPs to attend in person. His comments were criticised by opposition parties and unions, who said the move would put lives at risk. In a rebuke to Rees-Mogg, the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, told MPs: “My priority and the priority for all I am sure is to make sure that those on the estate are safe while business is facilitated. “Nothing in the leader’s announcement changes the rules around social distancing in and around the chamber and throughout the parliamentary estate. The only changes on the guidance can come from Public Health England, I think we are all agreed on that. “I may suspend sittings between items of business to allow members to enter and exit the chamber. I am also quite prepared to suspend a sitting if I believe that the safe number of honourable members in the chamber risks being exceeded.” . Hoyle also warned that any move to drop MPs’ newly installed remote voting system would increase the time taken to vote. “If the physical divisions replace remote divisions they will take much longer, possibly up to an hour, to make sure social distancing can be observed,” he said. Before the lockdown, MPs had eight minutes to cast their votes and the result would follow a few minutes later. Electronic voting, which takes 15 minutes with the result announced later, was used for the first time on Tuesday.
The Speaker’s intervention came in direct response to Rees-Mogg’s statement to MPs on Tuesday. Whitehall sources said the government was aiming for a return in early June. That would have gone against current advice to MPs and thousands of support staff and civil servants who work in parliament. At present, they are under instructions to stay at home and to go to the parliamentary estate only if they cannot avoid it. Boris Johnson, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, health minister Nadine Dorries and the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, were among many MPs and civil servants who tested positive for Covid-19. Following the remote vote on Tuesday evening, Rees-Mogg told MPs he would extend virtual voting to 20 May but did not expect to do so again. “It is clear that soon parliament must set an example of how we move back gradually to a fully functioning country again. Our constituents would expect nothing less,” he said.
“So while we must move in step with public health guidance, it is vital that when we are asking other people to work and go to their places of work if they cannot do so from home we should not be the ones who are exempt from that. “Indeed, we should be leading by example.” Rees-Mogg, speaking after Hoyle’s statement, said: “It is obviously important that this house maintains social distancing in accordance with the guidelines.” The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “Work is ongoing by the house authorities in step with the public health advice to carefully move back to more ordinary business and have more physical proceedings in the house. The government supports those efforts.” But critics have pointed out that Rees-Mogg’s call for a return to “business as usual” follows lacklustre performances by the prime minister in front of a near empty chamber against Labour’s leader. Kevin Brennan, the Labour MP, wrote on Twitter: “I think Rees-Mogg wants the House of Commons back in person so that Boris Johnson is not left alone at PMQs desperately looking about for support from empty loyal benches as he flounders around trying to wriggle off the hook of @Keir_Starmer ‘s penetrating interrogation.” Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader, said Rees-Mogg’s aim of a return of a “physical” parliament contradicted the government’s own health advice. The SNP’s shadow Commons leader, Tommy Sheppard, said it was a “fantasy” to believe that physical sittings could resume on 2 June without special procedures being in place. Rees-Mogg’s call followed the government’s 60-page “roadmap”, published on Monday, which said: “Parliament must set a national example of how business can continue in this new normal; and it must move, in step with public health guidance, to get back to business as part of this next step, including a move towards further physical proceedings in the House of Commons.”"
2020-05-13T15:22:36Z,politics,Politics,Nearly 800 reports of people defrauding UK furlough scheme,"The government has received nearly 800 reports of suspected fraud of its job retention scheme, launched less than a month ago. The tax authority, HMRC, which is responsible for overseeing the furlough scheme under which the government pays 80% of the wages of those who cannot work because of the coronavirus lockdown, said it was assessing the fraud reports and anyone with further information could make a report online. The government hotline for reporting fraud is currently not operating, because the vast majority of HMRC staff are working from home and it is not possible to divert such calls to their mobile phones. HMRC said it was “committed to ensuring the tax systems we operate are used fairly and efficiently, and where necessary will take action to ensure compliance with the relevant rules, regulations and legislation that govern the UK taxation systems. We value all the information provided to us by members of the public aimed at helping us achieve that goal”. A spokesperson added: “We’d ask anyone concerned that their employer might be abusing the scheme to please contact us. It could be that you’re not being paid what you’re entitled to, they might be asking you to work while you’re on furlough, or they may have claimed for times when you were working.” The spokesperson said that HMRC would assess each report and would help put right “a genuine mistake”. They added that reports of fraud were only one way that claims were checked and payments may be withheld or would have to be repaid if they were based on dishonest or inaccurate information. “We won’t hesitate to take criminal action against the most serious cases,” the spokesperson said.
Dishonestly making a false representation to HMRC with the intention of obtaining a payment under the furlough scheme is an offence of fraud. Any company director found guilty of abusing the system could face up to 10 years imprisonment and unlimited fines. Those who assist in the fraud could face similar punishment. The Guardian has received reports from at least 10 members of the public who say they have been asked to work while on furlough. A finance worker told the Guardian she had been given the impression that if she didn’t work she would be fired. “Knowing that my company is fraudulently making us work while taking money from the government is really impacting my mental health. If I don’t work I lose my job and cannot pay my bills. If I report the company now, and the government stops paying my company, I might be the reason people don’t get paid,” she said. Another worker in the retail industry said his employer continued to request he carried out tasks while on furlough. But, he said: “I’ve stayed firm and not completed the tasks for fear of not being eligible for the furlough scheme.” A woman employed in the arts sector said she felt blackmailed into working, despite knowing it was against the law. “I could lose my job by not working. Colleagues could be complicit in fraud for continuing to work as they’ve been scared into doing,” she said. One woman, in digital marketing, said she’d been asked to work as normal, despite being on furlough. She said staff were told “we’d lose business otherwise and there was a loophole where this was OK, as it could be classed as training”. She added: “There seems to be hardly any checking on the process for furloughing staff.” The government announced on Tuesday that it is extending the scheme until October. It said 7.5 million people were now having 80% of their wages covered by the furlough policy."
2020-05-13T15:04:27Z,politics,Politics,Gerry Adams urges ministers to act after court internment ruling,"The legality of every internment during the Troubles will have to be scrutinised, the former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams has urged, after his convictions for escaping from the Maze prison were quashed by the supreme court. The unanimous decision of the UK’s highest court is likely to affect scores of claims from republicans and loyalists who are challenging their detention without trial during the 1970s. Five justices ruled that because the then secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Willie Whitelaw, had not personally considered whether to intern Adams, the requirements of the Detention of Terrorists (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 were not satisfied. Delivering judgment, Lord Kerr said: “It was clearly intended that the making of an [interim custody order] ICO, as opposed to the signing of the order, had to be the outcome of personal consideration by the secretary of state. In this case, a minister in the Northern Ireland Office had made the ICO. That minister could have signed the order, but he could not validly make it. “As a result, Mr Adams’ detention had not been lawfully authorised. His detention was therefore invalid, and it followed that he should not have been convicted of attempting to escape from lawful custody for the elementary but inevitable reason that the custody in which he had been detained was, in fact, not lawful. His appeal is therefore allowed, and his convictions are quashed.” Adams, 71, who has always denied being a member of the IRA, called on the government to identify and inform others whose internment may also have been unlawful. Between 1971 and 1975 almost 2,000 people were detained without trial. Documents released to the public records office under the 30-year rule revealed that the British prime minister at the time, Harold Wilson, knew there had been procedural irregularities in the detention of Adams and other republicans who tried to escape from the heavily guarded camp. “So the knowledge of my unlawful detention was known by the most senior level of the British system,” Adams said after the judgment. “Of course internment … was never lawful. In fact it set aside the normal principles of law and was based on a blunt and brutal piece of coercive legislation. I have no regrets about my imprisonment, except for the time I was separated from my family. “There is an onus on the British government to identify and inform other internees whose internment may also have been unlawful.” KRW Law, the Belfast solicitors acting on behalf of 15 former republican and 19 former loyalist internees, said their orders will have to be checked to see whether there had been “proper authorisation by the relevant secretary of state at the time of detention”. Those held were overwhelmingly nationalists or republicans; not all were members of paramilitary organisations. Adams was first interned in March 1972 and was released in June that year to take part in secret talks with the Conservative government in London. He was rearrested in July 1973 in Belfast and taken to the Maze, also known as Long Kesh detention centre. On Christmas Eve 1973 he was one of four detainees caught attempting to break out. A hole had been cut in a perimeter fence and all four men were already out of the prison. His second attempt, in July 1974involved kidnapping a man who had a striking resemblance to him from a bus stop in west Belfast. The man was taken to a house where his hair was dyed and he was given a false beard. His double was driven to the Maze where the plan was that he would be swapped for Adams in a visiting hut. Prison staff had been alerted, however, and Adams was arrested. The leader of the Ulster Unionist party, Steve Aiken, said IRA victims would be “left dismayed and angry” by the judicial decision."
2020-05-13T14:24:30Z,politics,Politics,PMQs: Keir Starmer presses Boris Johnson over care home deaths,"Boris Johnson has been accused by Labour of not knowing the government’s advice on coronavirus after he told Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions that it “wasn’t true” that the care home sector had been advised it was unlikely to face an outbreak. In a tricky series of exchanges in the Commons, Starmer put Johnson under intense pressure to explain the extent of care home deaths. Johnson also declined to say why the government had stopped publishing daily international comparisons of Covid-19 deaths now the UK had the highest number of fatalities in Europe and the second highest in the world.
Opening his questioning, Starmer noted new figures indicating that 40% of all UK coronavirus deaths had taken place in care homes, and he asked why it was that until 12 March the main government advice was that it remained “very unlikely” that people in care homes could be affected. “Does the prime minister accept that the government was too slow to protect people in care homes?” the Labour leader asked. Johnson said: “No, and it wasn’t true that the advice said that. Actually, we brought the lockdown in care homes ahead of the general lockdown. And what we’ve seen is a concerted action plan to tackle what has unquestionably been an appalling epidemic in care homes.”
Johnson said it was “absolutely true that the number of casualties has been too high”, but he insisted the government was reversing the trend on deaths in care homes. Starmer responded: “I’m surprised the prime minister queries the advice of his own government up to 12 March.” Labour later published a link to a government web page on Covid-19 advice to the care sector, which says it was “very unlikely that anyone receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected”. The page says the advice was withdrawn on 13 March. Starmer asked Johnson whether he agreed with the reported view of a hospital doctor that government policy had “seeded” the epidemic in care homes by transferring Covid-19 patients from hospitals. Johnson said discharges into care settings went down in March and April and that testing had been done. Pressing the prime minister about official death statistics released on Tuesday, Starmer asked him to explain why there appeared to be 10,000 more deaths than average in April, even beyond those officially attributed to the virus. He said: “Now I know the government must have looked into this. So can the prime minister give us the government’s views on these unexplained deaths?” Johnson did not reply to the question, saying only that Covid-19 was “an appalling disease which afflicts some groups far more than others”. Starmer replied: “The prime minister says that solving the problem in care homes is crucial, but that can only happen if the numbers are understood, and therefore I was disappointed that the prime minister didn’t have an answer to the pretty obvious question as to what are those 10,000 unexplained deaths.” Labour later announced that Starmer had written to the prime minister asking him to correct the record. Juxtaposing Johnson’s comments and the official advice from which he had quoted, Starmer wrote: “At this time of national crisis, it is more important than ever that government ministers are accurate in the information they give. Given this, I expect you to come to the House of Commons at the earliest opportunity to correct the record and to recognise that this was official government guidance regarding care homes.”
During PMQs, Starmer also asked why a chart showing worldwide death comparisons had been dropped from Tuesday’s daily No 10 press conference. Johnson replied that seeking such comparisons was “premature because the correct and final way of making these comparisons will be when we have all the excess death totals for all the relevant countries.” He urged Starmer to “contain his impatience”. Starmer said: “The problem with the prime minister’s answer is it’s pretty obvious that for seven weeks when we weren’t the highest number in Europe they were used for comparison purposes, but as soon as we hit that unenviable place they were dropped.” No 10 refused to accept that Johnson had been wrong about the guidance, and declined Starmer’s call for the prime minister to correct the record in parliament. Johnson’s press secretary claimed that Starmer had “inaccurately and selectively quoted from the guidance”, as he had wrongly used the word “remains” and not quoted the first half of the sentence. They argue Starmer’s wording therefore failed to make clear that the guidance was reflecting the then current position based on low community transmission, not a future prediction. However, the guidance did use the word “remains” and referred to the future saying: “It remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected.” Denying that the government was wrongly trying to split hairs, Johnson’s press secretary said: “The point we are making is that it’s not true what the leader of the opposition says.” Downing Street also confirmed that the international comparison of death rates by country had been dropped from the slide at the daily press conference, but denied it was because of embarrassment that the UK is showing the second worst toll after that of the US."
2020-05-13T12:19:07Z,politics,Politics,"UK-EU trade deal with tariffs impossible in six months, say diplomats","EU diplomats have dismissed Michael Gove’s suggestion that Brussels and the UK could negotiate a trade deal with tariffs on goods in six months, saying it “will never happen”. Giving evidence to the House of Lords EU committee last week, Gove said the government could “modify our ask” by giving up on a “zero-tariff, zero-quota” trade deal in order to keep the UK free from a duty to adhere to European standards on workers’ rights, environmental protection and state aid. Saying the UK might “end up like Canada”, which signed a trade deal with the EU including some tariffs and quotas on agricultural goods, Gove said: “We will regret that, we will think that it is a missed opportunity, but if that is the price that we have to pay then there we go.” The two sides are trying to negotiate a deal with zero tariffs and zero quotas (limits on goods), but the UK is resisting EU calls to maintain common standards in exchange for free trade. EU diplomats said Gove’s proposal was incompatible with the government’s refusal to extend the transition period. “If we are going to negotiate specific tariff lines, even if it is only a couple of hundred, there is no possibility that we will do this by the end of the year,” said one EU diplomat with experience in trade negotiations. “That’s completely unheard of. It will never happen. But if we are going to go into a line-by-line negotiation, this will take two years.” A second EU diplomat said negotiating even a small number of tariffs could take two or three years. “You cannot do this in six months’ time,” the diplomat said – a reference to the fact that the EU wants talks concluded by October to allow ratification by the end of the year. EU sources say it will be impossible to negotiate tariffs quickly because the 27 member states would need time to agree a common position, balancing competing national interests. “We will have to define a careful assessment on each tariff line to see where the EU interest is, because it may well be that we will also want to protect industrial products,” a third diplomat said. “Member states’ interests are not the same.” The source said diplomats “don’t really believe” signals from London that “the UK may be willing to concede tariffs and quotas on specific products, like Canada”. The EU insists the UK must be treated differently to Canada because of its proximity and far bigger trading ties. EU countries in northern Europe, who are strong supporters of free trade, would also strongly resist British calls to erect trade barriers in the Channel. It is feared that discussing tariffs would open the door to other trade restrictions. “Are we doing quotas? Are we going to have specific rules of procedure for different sectors? Are we going to have safeguards in some areas? It’s a nightmare,” said one of the diplomats. A UK government spokesperson said: “Our aim is achieve zero tariffs and zero quotas – that is at least as much in the EU’s interest as ours, and the EU has come close to reaching this aim in their other FTAs (free-trade agreements).” British and Brussels negotiators are holding their third round of post-Brexit talks, which are due to conclude on Friday, and EU expectations of a breakthrough are low. Meanwhile, the UK trade secretary, Liz Truss, has outlined the government’s negotiating aims for a trade deal with Japan, which it hopes will boost commerce between the two countries by £15.2bn. The UK is scrambling to replace trade agreements in place with dozens of countries through the EU, including one with Japan that came into force in 2019."
2020-05-12T18:53:37Z,politics,Politics,Chancellor extends UK furlough scheme until end of October,"The chancellor has extended the government’s coronavirus wage subsidy scheme for workers until the end of October despite its spiralling cost, as he attempts to prevent a wave of job losses in the summer. In a surprise move that underlines the likely duration of the economic crisis, Rishi Sunak said the unprecedented scheme would continue until the autumn, despite its eye-watering cost. With 7.5 million workers having their wages paid by the taxpayer, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the total cost of the scheme could now amount to more than £80bn. “To put that in context, in eight months, that is more than we spend on the education system in an entire year, it’s many times what we spend on the police, it’s many times more than we spend on social care, it’s about half what we spend on the whole NHS in a year,” he told the BBC. First launched in March, the scheme had been due to close at the end of June. Sunak said there would be no changes to the system, in which the government pays 80% of furloughed workers’ wages up to £2,500 a month, until the end of July. From August, the scheme will continue for all sectors and regions, but with greater flexibility to allow firms to bring staff back to work as the lockdown eases and the economy reopens. Under the current scheme furloughed employees cannot work. The chancellor also said that from August, employers would need to “share with the government the cost of paying salaries,” in an indication that the level of state support would gradually taper away. The scheme is currently costing the government about £14bn a month. It is supporting about 7.5m jobs at almost 1m companies. Official figures will give an early glimpse of the heavy economic toll of the shutdown on Wednesday, when the first estimate of GDP for the first quarter of the year is revealed. While it will only include the early stages of the lockdown, it is likely to show a sharp decline in activity, as businesses had begun to be shuttered and consumers confined to their homes. A source suggested reports on Tuesday night of a £337bn budget deficit were in line with some internal predictions. Sunak told the BBC he found the prospect of a wave of job losses heartbreaking: “We already know that many people have lost their jobs, and it breaks my heart. We’ve seen what’s happening with universal credit claims already. This is not something that we’re going to wait to see; it’s already happening.” He added: “There are already businesses that are shutting. There are already people who have lost their jobs. And as I said, that’s heartbreaking to me and that’s why I’m working night and day to limit the amount of job losses.” The Department for Work and Pensions has said there have been 1.8m claims for universal credit since mid-March. Sunak’s announcement of an extension to the furlough scheme came just ahead of a key deadline this weekend for firms to avoid starting redundancy consultations for job losses at the end of June. However, several key details about the future of the scheme are still missing. It is understood the Treasury will consult with employers’ groups about how companies might contribute to the cost of furloughing before providing an update later this month. The shadow chancellor, Annaliese Dodds, welcomed the extension, calling the furlough scheme “a lifeline for millions”. But she warned of job losses if struggling firms are forced to make a significant contribution. “The government must clarify today when employers will be required to start making contributions, and how much they’ll be asked to pay. If every business is suddenly required to make a substantial contribution from the 1 August onwards, there is a very real risk that we will see mass redundancies.” Although details have yet to be published, Sunak told the BBC the Treasury would be “taking on the lion’s share” of the cost, with businesses expected to meet the rest, so that workers still receive 80% of their usual salary. Speaking in the House of Commons, Sunak said he expected employers to “share the burden” with the state. The government could still face a rapid rise in unemployment if companies balk at the prospect of contributing large sums, given the length of time it could take to fully reopen the British economy. Another major stumbling block could materialise if the Treasury insists companies across all sectors of the economy make contributions, even though lockdown controls will be lifted earlier for some businesses than others in England. Leaders in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also moving at different speeds to the government in Westminster. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of Hospitality UK, which represents the pubs, bars and restaurants that are expected to reopen last, said: “The full 80% may need to be extended past July for some businesses in sectors like hospitality that will still operate at much reduced levels of trade, or not yet be able to open.” Concerns had been rising over the cost of the furlough scheme following rapid take-up, with a price tag almost as much as the monthly bill for running the NHS. The scheme has been much more widely used than initially expected by the Treasury. Almost a quarter of all workers in Britain were furloughed by their employers within the first two weeks of the scheme’s launch in mid-April. While the overall price tag for the scheme will steadily rise until October, the ultimate cost depends on how much support the government decides to offer for this period.
Business leaders and trade unions broadly welcomed the move to extend the scheme. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said it would come as a “relief” to families across the country. “Changing the rules to allow part-time working is key to enabling a gradual and safe return to work. And maintaining the rate at 80% is a win for the pay packets of working families,” she added. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, said it was essential that government support schemes adapt in parallel to economic activity slowly recovering. However, she warned that employers would still need to see more detail about how they will contribute to the scheme. There are also fears that increased flexibility of the scheme from August could introduce the risk of abuse by some employers. John Phillips, acting general secretary of the GMB trade union, said muddled government guidelines over the gradual lifting of restrictions could make matters worse. “Many well-intentioned employers, who want to keep their staff furloughed, will find themselves competing with unscrupulous companies who want to drag their staff back before it is safe to do so,” he said. The extension could also fuel increasing divisions in society without significant further interventions by the government. While company employees can receive 80% of their usual pay up until October, the chancellor did not provide an update for the self-employed. Millions of people are also expected to fall through gaps in the safety net, having instead to rely on the benefits system, which provides much less support. Due to launch on Wednesday, the support package for people working for themselves was designed to provide income support for the three months to May, with an option to extend the scheme “if necessary”. It is understood the government is now preparing an update for the self-employed. Sunak added: “I am extending this scheme because I won’t give up on the people that rely on it. We stood behind Britain’s workers as we came into this crisis, and we will stand behind them as we come through the other side.” The SNP’s economic spokesperson, Alison Thewliss, warned that the scheme must take account of the different speeds at which Scotland and Wales are likely to reopen their economies. “Crucially, the scheme must remain in place and fully funded for as long as each of the four nations of the UK require it. People in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland must not be penalised if changes to the lockdown are made at a different pace,” she said."

2020-05-12T17:40:36Z,politics,Politics,Hancock can’t buy himself a break while Sunak harvests the magic money tree | John Crace,"When your luck is out, your luck is out. And right now Matt Hancock can’t seem to buy himself an even break. Dominic Cummings and his cabinet colleagues are lining him up as the fall guy for when the coronavirus crisis eventually ends – no point getting rid of him any sooner or someone else might have to also take the rap – and there’s nothing he can do about it. Hell, he doesn’t even get any credit for having survived the coronavirus without much fuss. Brave Boris still gets a free pass for having gone into intensive care, but Hancock’s recovery is by and large ignored. He’s just the schmuck that has to suck it up. He’s in way too deep to get away with saying what he’d always really thought: that Johnson was never fit to be prime minister. So he can only look on in envy at Jeremy Hunt for having had an uncharacteristic fit of self-worth by turning down a cabinet job and reinventing himself as one of the good guys. Jezza, the man who did more than anyone to cut back the NHS, now on the side of the angels. Who’da thunk it?
There was a time when Matt’s eyes used to gleam with enthusiasm. When he believed he could really make a difference. That he had a sense of purpose. Tigger used to bounce out of bed, believing he was the man to teach the NHS to sing in perfect harmony. Now he knows better and there’s only furtiveness and suspicion in his every move. Every day can only be worse than the one before. So when he was told he would be doing the morning media round to clean up after Boris’s latest mess – you’d have thought the prime minister might know the difference between a virus and a vaccine – he knew what was in store. Not that Downing Street hadn’t tried to make it easier for whatever poor sap drew the media short straw, by having refused to send a minister to be interviewed by Susanna Reid and Piers Morgan for the past 10 days. But Matt is now so far gone that he views even the comparatively less threatening BBC Breakfast with deep suspicion. All the presenter Louise Minchin wanted were some basic answers to some fairly straightforward questions. Why was it OK to meet in a garden centre and not a garden? Why was it OK for a childminder to look after kids but not other family members? Yet right from the off, Matt looked and sounded like a man on the edge. Just one wrong word and his eyes would go ice-cold. There was none of the usual charm, the going the extra mile to make himself plain. Just a series of bad-tempered, monosyllabic grunts. Hell, he was sick of hearing how bad things were for the rest of the country. How about someone think of just how shit he was feeling right now? Things got worse when Hancock moved on to Radio 4’s Today programme where Martha Kearney was being the model of politeness. If confusing Monday and Wednesday was the worst mistake the government had made then things must be pretty damn good, Matt snapped. A nation blinked. Hancock never does sarcasm in public. No more Mr Nice Guy. And it wasn’t a one-off aberration. He carried on with the same snippiness throughout, before his speech collapsed into meaningless disconnection. “People understand the message,” he said. “People understand what ‘stay alert’ means, it means, er, and people understand that together we need to control the virus.” It would have been better for Matt if the interview had been wrapped up there and then. Sadly, he re-found language in time to say we should be jolly proud that only 25% of our deaths had been in care homes, as that compared very favourably with other countries worldwide. Given that 10,000 have died in care homes that must rather imply that our death rate in hospitals and the community must be totally horrific compared with other countries. Whatever. The pathos was tangible. Even when Matt is trying to be helpful he still can’t stop himself from handing over evidence for the prosecution. He is a man so near to the edge he can’t even prevent himself from ganging up on himself. He needs a therapist urgently. Yet quantity theory has a way of evening things out. And Hancock’s bad luck is proving to be Rishi Sunak’s good luck. Everything the chancellor touches turns to gold right now. Which is just as well, as he’s spending money like it’s going out of style. Little more than two months ago, Rishi was earmarked for a B-list cabinet post in the Treasury but after Sajid Javid’s hissy, he has found himself in the top job and blessed with access all areas to the magic money tree. Austerity? What austerity?
His first Brexit budget proved to be little more than spare change compared with his eight – or is it nine? – subsequent coronavirus budgets. Today he was back in the Commons to answer an urgent question on extension of the government’s furlough scheme. And Rishi was all smiles. Because though Boris doesn’t have a clue how to stop the virus he has no qualms about spending money he doesn’t know he hasn’t got. So the chancellor got to take the credit for extending the furlough scheme for another four months at the same rate of 80%. Here his charmed life continued. Because even though there were gaping holes in his statement – how much of the 80% would employers be expected to contribute? Would bosses use the end of July as an excuse to make some workers redundant? What about the self-employed? – no one seemed to want to take him up on any of them. Rishi had just casually blown another £50bn. A 40th birthday present to himself. Remember the fuss about the £13bn annual contribution to the EU? No one else does. That’s how deep we’re in the shit. But Rishi keeps floating to the top. When your luck’s in, you ride that train to its very last stop."
2020-05-12T17:30:37Z,politics,Politics,US message to Britain in bilateral trade talks: it's us – or China,"The US government has been privately pressing the UK in bilateral trade talks to make a choice between the US and China. The US is seeking to insert a clause that would allow it to retreat from parts of the deal if Britain reaches a trade agreement with another country that the US did not approve. The proposed clause made no mention specifically of China, but is seen by British diplomats in Washington as intended to be a lever to deter closer UK-China relations. It had been seen by the UK as equivalent to the public pressure the US had been placing on Britain not to reach an agreement with Huawei to provide the UK’s 5G telecoms network. Most of the controversy concerning the US-UK trade talks has so far focused on the prices of medicines, food standards and a digital tax. The proposed clause is based on article 30 of the US-Mexico-Canada agreement that locks out non-market economies. Although the UK does not formally oppose such clauses, British diplomats are worried that in the current context it would give the US extensive and unbalanced leverage over UK policy towards China. UK diplomats are more broadly concerned that Donald Trump’s determination to use the coronavirus outbreak as a political stick with which to beat China, and secure his re-election, is going to place the UK government under intense external pressure to side with the US against China. Support for a stronger anti-China posture is growing across Conservative benches. The former chancellor George Osborne said he was nevertheless confident that Boris Johnson was not going to succumb, saying: “Curiously, the member of the cabinet most in favour of engagement with China is the prime minister. He is perfectly prepared to resist some of the pressure from his backbenches.” Osborne, speaking at a Strand Group webinar, added: “Multilateralism is a way for countries to cooperate on shared objectives. You cannot have this and side with the US in isolating China from the global system. It is the longest continuously existing civilisation in the world.” Osborne recalled that when he was chancellor, Johnson, who at the time was mayor of London, accompanied him on a trip to China and fully understood the need for cooperation with Beijing. In a Harvard Kennedy school of government paper jointly written by the former Treasury minister Ed Balls, the authors claim a full trade deal before the US presidential election in November is impossible. They also suggest even a mini-deal might present a dilemma for the UK, since it could draw it into an emerging US foreign and economic policy based on anti-China bilateralism, and so close the door on plans for a global Britain. The paper cites an unnamed UK government official saying: “The talks could conclude with a political statement that pulls the UK towards an anti-China, anti-cooperative view of the world.” It also cites a UK finance official saying: “The US government seems to want to use the pandemic to cut off China from the global economy, to onshore manufacturing and redesign the global economy, to reprioritise around security while saying you can’t have China as part of the system because of how they behave.
“Is this electioneering rhetoric? Or is it potentially much more dangerous, a desire to have a different global economy where China isn’t part of the system?” A Foreign Office official is quoted saying: “The strategy is not to leave the EU and find out that the US is setting the agenda and the UK is bound to the US because of a trade deal.” Some UK officials believe there is still merit in the UK trying to reach a preliminary outline deal with China before the US presidential election, arguing it will put pressure on the EU to reach a deal with the UK by the end of the deal. They also believe the prospect of a UK deal could be used as leverage to persuade Trump to adopt a more multilateral approach to the coronavirus crisis."
2020-05-12T16:59:42Z,politics,Politics,An apology to pet food manufacturers,"Ron Jeffries’ letter (11 May) about using tights to stake a cherry tree reminds me that in my youth we were advised to throw old nylon stockings into our tree, weighted with a stone, to prevent birds stealing all the cherries. “The starlings will think they are snakes,” the local sage assured us. After the birds ate every cherry, the stockings and tights remained in the tree for years, causing much local amusement and embarrassment for my mother, especially in the bare branches of the winter. Adam Liddell Bournemouth • Old tights have another use on cherry trees: when the cherries start to ripen, pull old tights over the branches to effectively keep pigeons from gorging on the ripening fruit. Richard Ives Kettlestone, Norfolk • If Emmanuel Macron had wanted the French people to “stay alert”, he would have used the phrase “restez alertes”, not “restez prudents”; the latter translates as “be careful”, which makes much more sense in relation to an invisible virus (Johnson giving no clear direction on lockdown exit, says Starmer, 11 May). Veronica Leonard Caterham, Surrey • You report me (11 May) as saying that Boris Johnson’s broadcast to the nation on Sunday was a “dog’s dinner” in communication terms. Please may I apologise, through your letters page, for that insult to pet food manufacturers?

2020-05-12T13:20:29Z,politics,Politics,Northern Ireland reveals five-stage lockdown exit plan,"The Northern Ireland government has announced a plan for easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions that for now keeps the “stay home” message. The Stormont executive published a five-stage road map on Tuesday that showed a slower, more cautious strategy than Downing Street’s plan for England. Ministers rejected Boris Johnson’s “stay alert” slogan, which has been widely criticised as confusing, and also decided against setting projected dates for loosening restrictions. The plan broadly aligned Northern Ireland with Scotland and Wales, which have also rejected Downing Street’s Johnson’s new messaging. “We will not be driven by a timetable and we know some will be disappointed by that, but our roadmap doesn’t answer every query, it provides people with an indication of how things might move in the weeks and months ahead,” said Arlene Foster, the first minister and Democratic Unionist party (DUP) leader. Michelle O’Neill, the deputy first minister and Sinn Féin deputy leader, asked the public for patience. “When we’re in position to slowly and carefully move out of the lockdown, we will keep you updated every step of the way,” she said. The power-sharing executive last week extended Northern Ireland’s lockdown to 28 May and said it would avoid specifying dates for each of the five stages to have “sufficient flexibility” to modify the plan in line with scientific advice. In the first stage, groups of four to six people who do not share a household may meet outdoors while maintaining physical distancing. Churches will be allowed to open for private prayer and hold drive-through services. Big outdoor-based retailers such as garden centres will also be allowed to reopen. In stage two, certain types of non-food retailers can open, as can some libraries and open-air museums. In stage four, hairdressers, fitness studios and tattoo parlours can reopen and schools will open for all children on a part-time basis, blending in-school and remote learning. Cafes, restaurants and pubs will have to wait until step five to reopen. The DUP and Sinn Féin sparred in the early stages of the pandemic – Sinn Féin wanted to close schools before Downing Street recommendations – but now present a united front in steering a policy that in several aspects sets Northern Ireland apart from the Republic of Ireland as well as England. The blueprint detailed the scientific and health criteria that must be met for moving to each of the five stages. A key criterion will be the R-value, or reproduction number, which is estimated at 0.8-0.9. Authorities want to push it lower before easing restrictions. Northern Ireland has registered 438 coronavirus-related deaths, a per capita rate significantly below that of England and on par with Ireland. However, the Unite union has warned that the devastating toll in Northern Ireland’s care homes could be repeated in meat-packing plants unless there is mass testing and deep cleaning. A worker based at a Moy Park plant in Dungannon died after contracting coronavirus, part of what the union said was a cluster in mid-Ulster. The republic is to begin its own five-stage lockdown exit plan on 18 May, with intervals of three weeks. Critics have accused authorities in Belfast and Dublin of paying lip-service to coordination instead of forging an all-island strategy, as happened with previous disease outbreaks involving animals. Some of the republic’s highest infection rates are in counties along the 310-mile border, fuelling concern about possible spillover."
2020-05-12T11:11:04Z,politics,Politics,Public advised to wear face coverings under UK government's lockdown easing plan,"The public will be advised to wear face coverings in crowded places and wash their clothes regularly, as the government imposes “smarter controls” to limit the spread the coronavirus until a successful treatment or vaccine is found. After Boris Johnson’s address to the nation on Sunday, which prompted a backlash from unions and opposition politicians about the lack of a clear message, the government published a 60-page document called Our Plan to Rebuild. More outdoor activities are being allowed from this week but the public will be expected to take extra caution, including by wearing face coverings in some situations. People should “wear a face covering in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible and they come into contact with others that they do not normally meet, for example on public transport or in some shops”, the government document says. Children under the age of two should not have their faces covered, and nor should any of primary age who do not have somebody with them who is supervising them. This is aimed at preventing people who have the virus but are not experiencing symptoms from passing it on to others.
The chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, stressed that face coverings were “not a substitute” for physical distancing and urged the public not to buy surgical or medical masks, needed for frontline carers, but to rely on scarves or DIY-type masks instead. The public should wash their clothes regularly, the advice suggests, “as there is some evidence that the virus can stay on fabrics”. The government is increasing fines for people who breach the new guidance, with the new penalties ranging from £100 for a first offence to a maximum of £3,200.
In his foreword to the document, Johnson suggested much of the document applied to all four nations of the United Kingdom, calling it “a plan to rebuild the UK for a world with Covid-19”. But there has been tension with Scotland and Wales, which will make their own decisions about issues including when schools will reopen, and which have warned against any significant easing of restrictions. The document sets out a three-step “second phase” of the government’s approach to tackling the outbreak, in what is called an “indicative roadmap”:
More people will be “actively encouraged” to go back to work from this Wednesday. Potentially from 1 June, some schools and businesses, including non-essential shops, will reopen, and some sporting and cultural events will be allowed to take place behind closed doors. Potentially from 4 July, some remaining businesses, such as hairdressers, and social spaces such as cinemas and pubs, will be allowed to reopen. The document makes clear that the exact timing of each of the steps will depend on scientific advice. The government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he and his colleagues had “strongly supported the conditionality” of the government’s approach, and each step would have to be science-based, not “date-based”. The government seeks to stress in the document that decisions are not being made solely on the basis of economics and health, but by balancing both, in what it repeatedly calls a “fair” way. It says the aim is to “return life to as close as normal as possible, for as many people as possible, as fast and as fairly as possible … in a way that avoids a new epidemic, minimises lives lost and maximises health, economic and social outcomes”.
Phase two, the first step of which begins this week, will aim to “gradually replace the existing social restrictions with smarter measures that balance its aims as effectively as possible”. As well as advising the public to wear face coverings, employers are being urged to redesign workplaces to minimise the number of individuals people come into contact with, including increasing ventilation. This approach is described as “making contact safer by redesigning public and work spaces, and those with symptoms self-isolating”. During this first, immediate stage, parliament will be expected to hold more physical sessions, to “set a national example of how business can continue in this new normal”.
The government is also changing its guidance to allow more childcare providers to reopen. The document says “paid childcare, for example nannies and childminders, can take place”, as long as health guidelines such as avoiding crowds and washing hand are followed. Unlike the UK-wide “stay at home” advice, the document makes clear some measures could be applied locally, with the government’s aim described as “detecting infection outbreaks at a more localised level and rapidly intervening with targeted measures”. The government has delayed plans to allow members of the public to mingle their household with another, creating a “bubble”, along the lines of measures that have been taken in New Zealand. Vallance said: “We have been asked to look at this, and we will look at it and come back with the scientific advice.” For the time being, contrary to what Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, suggested in interviews on Monday morning, the public are only permitted to meet one other person, outdoors – not both parents, for example.
Ministers are still aiming at a 1 June return for some pupils, as part of the second step, which would allow “reception, year 1 and year 6 to be back in school in smaller sizes”, according to the document. “This aims to ensure that the youngest children, and those preparing for the transition to secondary school, have maximum time with their teachers. Secondary schools and further education colleges should also prepare to begin some face to face contact with year 10 and 12 pupils who have key exams next year, in support of their continued remote, home learning.” It adds: “The government’s ambition is for all primary school children to return to school before the summer for a month if feasible, though this will be kept under review.” Government officials suggested parents would be strongly encouraged to send their children to school once classes had reopened. Teachers who are in the most vulnerable, “shielded” group will be expected to remain at home, while others who are vulnerable, such as pregnant women, could take part in “non-pupil-facing” work, such as lesson planning.
There will be little change for “those aged over 70, those with specific chronic pre-existing conditions and pregnant women. These clinically vulnerable people should continue to take particular care to minimise contact with others outside their households, but do not need to be shielded.” However, the document hints that some individuals could be moved out of the shielded group as scientists understand more about the risk factors. “As the government learns more about the disease and the risk factors involved, it expects to steadily make the risk-assessment more nuanced, giving confidence to some previously advised to shield that they may be able to take more risk, and identifying those who may wish to be more cautious,” the report says. When to enact the various steps will depend on advice from a new joint biosecurity centre, which will “bring together the UK’s world-leading epidemiological expertise and fuse it with the best analytical capability from across government in an integrated approach”.
The government makes clear that a “new normal” will have to persist until a vaccine or treatment for the virus can be found. “There is no easy or quick solution. Only the development of a vaccine or effective drugs can reliably control this epidemic and reduce mortality without some form of social distancing or contact tracing in place,” it says. It also rejects the idea that “herd immunity” was ever part of the government’s approach to dealing with Covid-19, despite Vallance at one point appearing to advocate it. “In the medium term, allowing the virus to spread in an uncontrolled manner until natural population-level immunity is achieved would put the UK government’s Covid-19 recovery strategy under enormous pressure. At no point has this been part of the government’s strategy.”"
2020-05-12T10:25:06Z,politics,Politics,UK national security council has not met since January,"Britain’s national security council – a meeting of senior ministers with military and spy chiefs – has not met since late January and there are no plans for it to come together this week, prompting growing concern in some quarters of Whitehall. The high-level body used to meet weekly under David Cameron and Theresa May but has only done so sporadically since the election, and some fear it is being made deliberately redundant during the coronavirus crisis. A meeting was cancelled last week and multiple sources confirmed there were no immediate plans to rearrange, despite tensions with China over the origins of Covid-19 and a recent return by the RAF to bombing Islamic State positions in Iraq. Key decisions across government are being made by the all-male “Covid quad”, a morning meeting involving four leading ministers plus the prime minister, a tight decision-making model preferred by Boris Johnson’s chief aide, Dominic Cummings. The four are Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary; Rishi Sunak, the chancellor; Matt Hancock, the health secretary; and Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who acts as a cross-Whitehall fixer. Some fear classified material is being discussed at the meetings where advisers without a high level of clearance are present, although a No10 source said that was not the case. Decisions involving intelligence were taken as needed elsewhere, they added. The decision not to hold NSC meeting was “a pragmatic response” to the coronavirus crisis, the source said, which involved an urgent shakeup of Whitehall machinery, and that the body remained important. But Labour warned security threats such as terrorism and cyber-attacks had not gone away. Conor McGinn, the shadow security minister, said: “At a time when the UK is facing threats to its national security every day, it is deeply worrying that the NSC hasn’t met for months. “The prime minister should urgently convene the NSC and ensure it meets weekly, as it has done for the past decade.” Ministers who would normally be closely involved in national security discussions but appear to be excluded from the decision-making are Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, and Priti Patel, the home secretary. Wallace unexpectedly let slip at a defence select committee meeting last month that the NSC had not met during the coronavirus crisis. Its last full meeting involving ministers and service chiefs was at the end of January, to sign off the decision to allow Huawei a limited role in the UK’s 5G network. In the Commons, Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, added to the pressure, by calling on Wallace to summon “an urgent meeting” of the NSC to review how China and Russia may be exploiting the coronavirus crisis. “The world order was already in a fragile state,” Ellwood told MPs. “And now under the fog of COVID-19 countries such as China and Russia are exploiting this global distraction to further their own geopolitical agenda”. Wallace said it was not up to him to decide whether to convene an NSC meeting and that the decision to hold one “is a matter for the national security directorate within the Cabinet Office and the cabinet and the Prime Minister”. He added: “It is not the case that by not having it we have no agenda on security.” A Downing Street spokesman said: “We do not routinely comment on matters regarding the national security council. The government continues to protect the UK’s national security while addressing the pressing demands of the Covid-19 pandemic.”"
2020-05-11T23:01:55Z,politics,Politics,"Extend furlough scheme or face spiralling job losses, Rishi Sunak told","The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been urged to extend the coronavirus wage subsidy scheme until September to avoid spiralling job losses across Britain this summer. Against a backdrop of mounting pressure on the government to provide continued support as lockdown measures are gradually removed, the Resolution Foundation said the extension would cost the exchequer as much as £48bn but would prevent a fresh surge in unemployment. After Boris Johnson announced on Sunday his blueprint for the gradual lifting of restrictions, industry groups warned it was incomplete without urgent details about the job retention scheme. Lex Butler, the chair of the Hotel Booking Agents Association, said: “We immediately need to know that the furlough scheme will be extended beyond the end of June and on what terms. We need clarity now to prevent closures and large scale loss of jobs.” Employees in the hospitalities sector are expected to return to work last, possibly from July. Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “Firms will need to know that government support schemes, which have helped save millions of jobs in recent weeks, will continue for as long as they are needed so that they can plan ahead with confidence.” Johnson told parliament on Monday that Sunak would announce details on the future of the furlough scheme on Tuesday. The chancellor is widely expected to announce the gradual wind-down of the scheme amid rising concern over its cost, which is roughly £14bn a month. Under the scheme, workers receive 80% of their pay up to £2,500 a month. More than 6 million were protected at 800,000 firms in the first two weeks of the scheme’s operation. Options the Treasury is understood to be considering include cutting the level of support to 60% while allowing staff to work some of their hours. The Resolution Foundation urged the government to allow for “partial furloughing” from as early as June, but said the 80% support should also be kept in place across the economy until at least August. It could then gradually be scaled back. However, the thinktank recommends 80% support continuing until at least September for businesses in sectors where the return to work will take longer, including hospitality. Sunak is under pressure from business leaders to provide an update this week because employers have to allow for at least 45 days to consult on redundancies of more than 100 staff. Companies face a deadline of 18 May to begin the redundancy consultation process if the furlough is no longer available in July. Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: “Moving too quickly could spark a huge second surge in job losses at a time when unemployment already looks set to be at the highest level for a quarter of a century. “The scheme cannot last forever however. It should be phased out gradually, with a longer timeframe for the hardest-hit sectors.” On Sunday Johnson said it was time for sectors in which home-working was not possible – including manufacturing and construction – to get back to work. But the Confederation of British Metalforming (CBM), which represents about 200 manufacturing companies across Britain, said it would take longer for the economy to recover and that further financial support would be required while production levels remain below normal. The CBM said up to 30% of jobs (12,000) among its members could be cut if assistance was taken away at the end of June. The finance lobby group TheCityUK said it expected UK firms would face unsustainable debts of up to £105bn that would need to be managed before March next year.
Alongside continued support from the government, the major high street banks have been ordered by the Bank of England to make more loans to firms to help keep them running. A spokesman for the Treasury said the job retention scheme had already protected millions of jobs. “Future decisions around the scheme will take into account the wider context of the measures in place, as well as the public health response,” they said. “We have been clear there will be no cliff edge and people will be eased back into work in a measured way.”"
2020-05-11T19:19:30Z,politics,Politics,Motor misfires as PM tries to steer away from car crash of night before,"There are few places more unforgiving than a near-empty House of Commons. Without the roar of sycophantic backbenchers cheering his every empty promise or cabinet sidekicks to feed him answers to difficult questions, Boris Johnson is hopelessly exposed. He somehow looks both much older than his 55 years and yet also much younger. The hollow man-child who finds himself of necessity self-reliant, yet with few inner resources on which to rely, can now only act out some half-remembered impressions of himself. On Monday, for his first coronavirus statement – hard to believe that it has taken the prime minister five months to address parliament – Johnson chose to adopt the more grown-up, serious act. With limited success. Unsurprising, really, given that his prime goal was to sweep up the debris from his car-crash televised statement the night before that only managed to further confuse everyone. How he must wish he had stuck to protocol and waited till he had got at least some of his ducks in a row before sounding off. But Johnson has never been able to resist the big audience, even if it’s certain to end in hubris. He’s hard-wired to self-destruct. As so often, he began by distancing himself from any responsibility for the crisis. That all belonged to an entirely different Johnson. One from whom he had now entirely split.
So, far from moaning about one of the highest death rates in Europe, we should be celebrating the fact that 500,000 people had not died. And just wait till he found out which government had been responsible for the lack of personal protective equipment and testing and the crisis in care homes. Then there would be hell to pay. But mostly Johnson wanted to make clear that the parts of Sunday’s televised speech that people had found confusing weren’t really as confusing as all that. Although it might appear that he was easing the lockdown, the reality was that nothing had changed. All he was doing was restating the regulations he had put in force back in March that rather too many people had interpreted too zealously. When he had said that people should stay at home wherever possible, it had never occurred to him for a minute that people would take him at his word. So now he just wanted all those people whom he had always meant to carry on working to get back to work instead of staying at home. Though, obviously, people should only go back to work if they could get there without taking public transport, if their employers had implemented proper social distancing measures in the workplace and they didn’t have any problems with childcare. The very reasons why most people had stopped going to work in the first place. And people could now go swimming in the sea and go for a drive because they were basically already doing that of their own accord.
The good news for Johnson was that Keir Starmer had only six minutes to point out the obvious flaws. The Labour leader could happily have gone on for at least an hour and still barely scratched the surface. When were the new regulations meant to come in place? Monday or Wednesday? And why were there still no guidelines on how and in what circumstances people should return to work? What would happen to those workplaces that could only safely accommodate a quarter of their previous staff? Did the new quarantine measures merely apply to air travel or were ports affected as well? And, and, and ... it was all too clear Starmer had a far better idea of what the government’s plans were than the prime minister. In reply, Johnson merely rattled off a few random sentences, only a few of which connected to the previous one. The man with the golden voice has lost the gift of language. The best he could manage was that good old British common sense would win through in the end, because that’s the one thing the coronavirus wouldn’t be expecting. Just Stay Alert!
He’d be guided by the science throughout and if the odd town needed to be shut down then he wouldn’t hesitate to do it – how, he couldn’t say – but the plan was for all employers to behave as they always did, with their workers’ best interests at heart, and for primary schools to reopen in June. Social distancing would be maintained by applying Velcro pads to the floor so that the children wouldn’t be able to move for the entire day. And some of them would wear masks and some wouldn’t, depending on how they felt. Every Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MP was at pains to point out that Johnson was speaking for England only, and that they would be sticking with the advice that had more or less worked so far. But Johnson wouldn’t hear a word of it. As far as he was concerned, his new guidelines applied to the whole of the UK even though they didn’t. His idea of consensus is unusual to say the least. It won’t be long before the people’s republic of Tooting declares independence and also chooses to go it alone. Guard posts on the Streatham border. Still, at least a few Tory MPs found time to telephone in a few sycophantic helpful apercus about what a marvellous job Johnson was doing. A victory for good old-fashioned British nonsense."
2020-05-11T19:14:26Z,politics,Politics,"'I hope, hope, hope' for a vaccine, but it is not guaranteed, says Johnson â€” as it happened","There is no guarantee of a Covid-19 vaccine, Boris Johnson said at this eveningâ€™s press conference, though he said the UK is at the heavily involved in the work to develop one. Iâ€™m hearing some very encouraging things from whatâ€™s going on at Oxford to achieve a vaccine [but] this is by no means guaranteed. I believe Iâ€™m right in saying that, even after 18 years we still donâ€™t have a vaccine for Sars. What I can tell you is that the UK is at the forefront of concerting international activity to try to deliver a vaccine. He said the UK government is putting â€œhuge sumsâ€� into finding a vaccine, but added: If you ask me am I absolutely certain that we wonâ€™t be living with this for a long time to come, I canâ€™t say that. It may be that we have to become ever more flexible, ever more agile, ever smarter in the way that we tackle, not just this infection, but potentially future infections as well. While he agreed the development of a vaccine cannot be guaranteed, the UK governmentâ€™s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said: Iâ€™d be surprised if we didnâ€™t end up with something."
2020-05-11T17:44:25Z,politics,Politics,Opposition leaders attack Boris Johnson over muddled messaging,"Opposition leaders have rounded on Boris Johnson for sending out confusing and muddled advice that they claimed could cost lives as the government attempts to move away from the coronavirus lockdown. MPs in the Commons criticised the change of the government’s message from “stay at home” to “stay alert”, questioned whether Johnson could still speak for the entire nation, and called for new work guidelines to be published before employees are expected to return on Wednesday. Johnson denied that he has been acting as the prime minister of England after the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland rejected Downing Street’s new slogan. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said Johnson had struggled to hold the nation together and failed to provide clarity and reassurance to concerned citizens. “There’s not consensus either on messaging now or on policy between the UK government and those in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, not something I know he [Johnson] wanted to see but now we’re in that position, [which] raises serious concerns, with a real danger of divergence,” he said. “What the country needs at this time is clarity and reassurance and at the moment both are in pretty short supply.” The SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, called for Johnson to accept that Scotland would continue to use the government’s previous “stay at home” message, even as the prime minister urged the UK public to “stay alert”. “Will the prime minister confirm that he accepts and respects that in the devolved nations the advice clearly remains ‘stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives’?” he asked. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, asked if Johnson could confirm that he was acting as prime minister of England.
Johnson rejected the criticisms, telling MPs the government was offering good advice for the whole of the UK. But he accepted that different places may need different policies in the short term. Johnson’s address to the nation on Sunday prompted concern from unions and opposition politicians about the lack of a clear message. The government then published further details on Monday in a 60-page document called Our Plan to Rebuild, which recommended wearing face coverings in crowded places and allowed further activities in outside spaces such as meeting friends. The document set out a three-step “second phase” of lockdown. Starting on Wednesday, people will be actively encouraged to return to work if they cannot work from home. From 1 June, if the R rate of the spread of the virus remains below one, some schools and businesses will reopen and sporting events will be allowed behind closed doors. Potentially from 4 July, some remaining businesses such as hairdressers and social spaces such as cinemas and pubs will be allowed to reopen. Johnson told MPs that the divergence of advice across the UK should be temporary. “The government is today submitting to the house a plan which is conditional and dependent, as always, on the common sense and observance of the British people and on continual reassessment of the data. That picture varies across the regions and home nations of the United Kingdom, requiring a flexible response. “Different parts of the UK may need to stay in full lockdown longer but any divergence should only be short-term because, as prime inister of the UK, I am in no doubt that we must defeat this threat and face the challenge of recovery together.” Johnson said he has asked the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to examine when the government could safely allow people to expand their household group to include one other household. He also said parents unable to access childcare should not be expected to go to work. Businesses across the country should be “Covid secure” and the Health and Safety Executive would enforce the rules, the prime minister said. “We will be having spot inspections to ensure businesses are keeping their employees safe.” People should not be travelling to a second home for a holiday, Johnson said. Asked by Fay Jones, the Conservative MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, if the government’s new strategy was a green light for tourism or for people to travel to their second homes in Wales, Johnson replied: “We don’t want to see people, let me repeat, we don’t want to see people travelling to another home for a holiday or to a second home.”"
2020-05-11T17:23:58Z,politics,Politics,New local lockdowns likely if biosecurity centre flags outbreak,"Schools and businesses in some areas could be forced to close if the new coronavirus biosecurity centre identifies a new disease outbreak, according to the government’s action plan for overcoming the pandemic. The Whitehall centre is to have an “independent analytical function” to assess the rate of infection community by community and recommend urgent lockdown measures if necessary. “It will identify specific actions to address local spikes in infections” and advise ministers “to close schools or workplaces where infection rates have spiked” to tackle unexpected outbreaks, according to the 60-page document. The joint biosecurity centre will also have responsibility for measuring a five-tier coronavirus alert system for England, announced by Boris Johnson on Sunday night, and will be based in the Cabinet Office, responsible for cross-government coordination.
The government said the centre would be “established swiftly in coming days”. It will replace the alert system currently determined by the UK’s four chief medical officers from each of the four nations, and once it is “initially operational” it will “support the chief medical officer [for England] reach this judgment by providing more, better data than we have available today,” it said. But Monday brought little other fresh detail about the centre, such as who would staff or run it. Its initial announcement on Sunday had already been criticised by the Scottish government, which was not briefed in advance. On Monday Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said it would be ideal for all of the UK to use the same five-tier system, but then added she wanted flexibility to allow different parts of the UK to be on different parts of the scale. Sturgeon said her government had not yet seen enough details of the plan to be certain whether Scotland would adopt it. She was “very keen”, however, to contribute to the UK-wide biosecurity centre, which will handle and disseminate the data and evidence about the virus’s spread. “I’m not in any way turning my mind against using [the five-tier alert]; it may well be a very helpful tool to use to judge the decisions we take and the way in which we face those decisions, but we will have to look at it a bit more closely before we can come to a definitive decision on that,” she said. The sliding scale is designed to mirror the existing terror threat system. Johnson repeated that the UK currently sits at tier four, where a coronavirus epidemic “is in general circulation; transmission is high or rising exponentially”. But the prime minister told MPs that the threat would shortly drop a notch “thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the British people by following the social distancing rules”. The announcement prompted questions as to whether the centre would be able to operate independently of political influence. Molly Scott Cato, a former Green party MEP, said there was no detail about its political accountability. “Whose expertise it relies on? Why and to what extent it diminishes the authority of Public Health England? Or what the involvement of political advisers may be?” the former MEP and economics professor tweeted."
2020-05-11T06:15:47Z,politics,Politics,"Smart suit, brushed hair. It was just Boris Johnson's speech that was a mess | John Crace","Stay alert. Watch out. There’s a Boris about. All his life Boris Johnson has fantasised about being the next Winston Churchill, the nation’s saviour. But 75 years after Churchill declared the end of the second world war in Europe, all Boris could manage to do in his pre-recorded television statement – his minders don’t trust him to do anything live – was divide the United Kingdom. The Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish had all managed to distance themselves from the prime minister’s central message even before it had been broadcast. Forget the Churchill tribute act; these days Boris couldn’t even get a job as a Boris Johnson tribute act.
It was never intended to be this way. Boris was meant to be the man who could put a smile on the country’s face; the man who would get Brexit done with blind optimism and a few white lies. But the coronavirus has put paid to all that. It’s a virus that stubbornly resists any smooth-talking about taking back control.
And deep down, Boris knows that he’s well out of his depth – that he’s simply not up to the job. You can see it in his eyes, which have shrivelled to puffy pinpricks. And he’s lost the gift of language. At a time of crisis, a leader’s speech is supposed to be a source of inspiration and reassurance. Somehow all that Boris can manage to impart now is a sense of panic. This time at least, Boris had made an effort. Smart suit, brushed hair. It was just the speech that was a mess. A more honest prime minister would have admitted that mistakes had been made in the handling of the crisis. But Boris is, deep down, a coward, a man who runs from the first hint of personal responsibility and has one eye already firmly on the public inquiry that will surely follow.
So what we got was more waffle about following the science and being grateful that even more people had not yet died. Why couldn’t the 65 million survivors be a bit more grateful? Not a word on why other countries were coping with the virus so much better than us. It must be a huge relief to the families of those who have died that the government didn’t choose to follow the South Korean science. No one could have predicted the need for more personal protective equipment in care homes (unless they had actually read the Exercise Cygnus report that predicted just that). And we would soon be conducting hundreds of thousands of tests a day. Boris still clings to the belief that just by saying something, he can make it come true. Not only are we struggling to reach a target of just 100K a day without some creative accounting – we don’t even have the resources to process the results in under 10 days. Having got his excuses and disclaimers out of the way, Boris got down to the substance of his speech. Or rather the lack of substance. Meet the new messaging: same as the old messaging. Only even vaguer and more confusing. Not so much 15 minutes of TV fame as uncomfortably like watching someone have a breakdown in front of you. Rather than just stay at home, Boris’s new maxim was to “Stay alert”. Less a slogan, more like a piece of advice to himself, given all the times he has taken his eye off the ball over the past few months. Even the writers of Dad’s Army wouldn’t have let Captain Mainwaring embarrass himself like that. It was as if what had been missing from the British war effort had been some blackout curtains and taking down road signs in a bid to confuse and slow the progress of the coronavirus. The one war slogan that might have been more apt was “Careless talk costs lives”. Because few people’s talk has been more careless than the prime minister’s. He’s a Zen master whose only objective is to get to the end of any one sentence, with no thought for the consequences for those that follow. For Boris there is no past and no future. And, as things stand, not much of a present. What was most striking was how little Boris had to say. His roadmap – or shape of a roadmap as he called it, making it sound uncomfortably like a homeopathic memory of a map – to the future looked uncomfortably like one of the M25. There were five exciting colours of alertness and the the promise of a Captain Marvel bio-science centre, but the bottom line was that it was still circular, with any number of still to be determined exit points, keeping alive the very real possibility that we might find ourselves back at the start. Much of it was just the same – often contradictory – advice. Social distancing, staying at home wherever possible, going to work wherever possible. How people were meant to get to work on public transport while staying 2 metres apart was not explained. He also gnomically stated that the reproduction rate had now come down far enough for us to test arrivals at airports in a month’s time. Clearly he’s been spending too long talking to Priti Patel, who insists the UK has both too many and too few air passengers to make testing a viability. There would also be some easing of the lockdown by the end of June (apart from the bits that might come sooner). (Or later.) It was all just a bit of a ramble, with nothing on the one question many people wanted answered: at what stage might people be allowed to see their family and friends again? “This is our plan,” Boris concluded, having forgotten he had just said he didn’t really have a plan, other than to stay alert and keep buggering on – something the rest of the country is increasingly wishing Boris might personally reconsider. Remember those far-off days when you thought we had scraped the barrel with David Cameron and Theresa May?"
2020-05-10T20:33:15Z,politics,Politics,'Recipe for chaos': union leaders sound warning over return to work,"Boris Johnson has been warned by trade unions that ordering many people back to work from as early as Mondayis a “recipe for chaos” in the absence of urgent action to safeguard workers’ health. The prime minister said on Sunday that anyone who cannot work from home should be “actively encouraged” to return to their jobs from Monday. Detailing plans to gradually reopen the British economy after more than a month of tough controls during the health emergency, he said those in manufacturing and construction jobs in particular should be encouraged to return. However, trade union leaders said the road map was too confusing and that vital measures were missing to protect people returning to work. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: “The government still hasn’t published guidance on how workers will be kept safe. So how can the prime minister – with 12 hours’ notice – tell people they should be going back to sites and factories? It’s a recipe for chaos.” John Philips, acting general secretary of the GMB union, said: “More mixed messages from the government – saying there’s no end to lockdown, but asking everyone to go back to work. “If ministers want the economy moving again, we need strict rules on hygiene and social distancing, enough PPE for everyone, regulations employers can’t just ignore if they fancy it.” Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said: “There must be no cutting corners, no playing fast and loose with employees’ safety. The economy is important, but lives are too.” Business leaders said more action to safeguard workers would be needed before the economy could be fully reopened. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, said: “This announcement marks the start of a long process. While stopping work was necessarily fast and immediate, restarting will be slower and more complex. It must go hand in hand with plans for schools, transport, testing and access to PPE. Firms will want to see a roadmap, with dates they can plan for.” Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK, the manufacturers’ trade group, said it cautiously welcomed the prime minister calling for factory staff to return to work. “However, it is critical that there is clear advice on how to do that, and an understanding that firms will be helped to comply as we navigate uncharted waters, and not punished for inadvertent errors.” Taking steps to modify the controls on social life and business activity across Britain, the prime minister said a phased reopening of shops would begin from the start of June, while some parts of the hospitality industry would be allowed to reopen from July. However, it is understood this will not include pubs. With the economy on the brink of the deepest recession in more than three centuries, Johnson said those returning to work should avoid using public transport if possible. However, transport unions warned that this could prove practically impossible and that they could be forced to take matters into their own hands if trains and buses became overcrowded. Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, said: “Rightly, social distancing limits capacity on public transport and, if we believe that staff or public are being put at risk, we will not hesitate to ensure all are protected.” Manual Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA transport union, said sending people back to work was dangerous and risked turning rail workers into “cannon fodder” for the sake of Tory donors in the construction sector. He said the idea that people could go work without using public transport was “a ridiculous notion”. “It will cause chaos, and our transport network is not ready for any increase in passengers,” he added. Johnson’s plan could risk fuelling a burgeoning divide in society between people unable to work from home and those in typically higher-paying jobs where it is possible. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, less than one in ten of those in the lowest half of all earners in Britain can work from home. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, almost 60% of workers in London are able to work from home, compared with 38% in the north-east. The thinktank has urged ministers to offer incentives to companies to help them adapt to more home working, arguing the benefits would be felt for society at large from lower levels of virus transmission."
2020-05-10T20:20:55Z,politics,Politics,Doctors and police warn of new coronavirus wave as UK lockdown weakens,"Doctors and police reacted to the government’s new “stay alert” slogan and Boris Johnson’s lockdown-easing measures with warnings of growing non-compliance and the “impossibility” of policing. The Police Federation, representing 120,000 rank-and-file officers, attacked a “week of mixed messages” from ministers, fuelled by media speculation, while medical experts said they increasingly expected to see a second rise in infections. New guidance is hurriedly being drawn up for officers around the country about the new rules set out by the prime minister, and what they should and should not police. John Apter, national chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: “Police officers will continue to do their best, but their work must be based on crystal clear guidance, not loose rules that are left open to interpretation – because that will be grossly unfair on officers whose job is already challenging. If the message of what is expected of the public is not clear then it will make the job of policing this legislation almost impossible.”
Prof Dame Til Wykes, of the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London, said the new communication strategy would hinder progress against the coronavirus. She said: “The communication plan of ‘stay alert, control the virus and save lives’ – unlike the first step in the plan – is very confused. We need clear rules and messages that are concise, clear and accurate. This is just short. “A woolly message will hinder – not promote – the next phase of this lockdown. The previous message to ‘stay home’ was at least clear. What does ‘stay alert’ mean? It will just be confusing, be open to misinterpretation and likely to increase risky behaviour. That means taking risks that will affect everyone and increase infections.” Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at Southampton University, said: “For these revisions [to government strategy] to be successful, we need consistent communications from the government, and the new ‘stay alert’ messaging is ambiguous and lacks clarity.”
Prof Sir Simon Wessely, former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the problem with “stay alert” was that “it’s hard to be clear what that means, as opposed to ‘stay inside’”. Having seen photos and video showing a lack of physical distancing at VE Day street parties on Friday – including a conga line – and in parks over the weekend, intensive care doctors shared concerns on social media that more people would end up in hospital with coronavirus. Dr David Hepburn, an intensive care consultant in Wales, tweeted: “Just watched the conga lines/street parties on the news. The nation has lost its fucking mind. We’re strapping in for the second wave. I’m so, so tired, and so pissed off. We’ve had a few days of respite and I was starting to feel hopeful. Can’t believe I was so naive.” Dr Ami Jones, another intensive care specialist, tweeted a link to a table showing the UK with the highest death rate in the world from the disease. She said: “Showing our supremacy in the world stats as we irresponsibly flout lockdown to celebrate VE Day in the worst fashion. Glad I’ve had a couple of weeks away from ITU to recuperate as the next wave is going to make this horrific statistic even worse. Things are about to get busy.” Large numbers of people sunbathing and picnicking on Saturday in London Fields in Hackney, east London, led local police to tweet that they were “fighting a losing battle” with the public over their behaviour.
A senior police officer who survived a spell in intensive care with Covid-19 criticised the public’s attitude towards observing the lockdown. Ch Supt Phil Dolby, of West Midlands police, wrote on Twitter: “A month ago today, on a ventilator and in a coma, I started to breathe for myself. I am very disturbed by the increasingly blasé way [people] are treating the lockdown. With lack of answers around immunity, my family and I are going to remain shielding. I can’t go through that again.” One chief constable told the Guardian: “There is far less compliance following mixed government messaging. It will be difficult to police anything other than large groups if freedom of movement is increased. What does that mean to people? It will be ignored. 90% ish doing the right thing at present. That will reduce dramatically over the coming weeks.” Senior police sources believe significant parts of their role in enforcing the lockdown are effectively over, other than policing large groups. “Impossible,” said one senior source."
2020-05-10T18:51:53Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson announces five-tier coronavirus alert system,"Boris Johnson has announced a five-tier alert system to rank the threat from coronavirus – although experts said it was not immediately clear how independent or effective the scheme would be. The current threat level of the pandemic will be categorised on a scale of one to five in different parts of the country, based on assessments by a new “joint biosecurity centre”. The system is designed to mirror the independent terror alert system, which ranks the threat to the public from “low” to “critical” and helps decide what protective measures are required. The prime minister said in his broadcast to the nation that the alert system would help the country “avoid going back to square one”. Alert levels, he added, would be determined by the number of cases and the R number, or transmission rate, of the virus.
“In turn, that Covid alert level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures. The lower the level, the fewer the measures. The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be,” Johnson said. Terror threat levels are agreed by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which is independent of ministers but includes representatives of 16 government departments plus police and intelligence agencies. Further details are expected to be announced when the full lockdown easing plan is presented in detail to parliament on Monday.
No detailed information has yet been released on the specific criteria for setting a level of alert. A former senior Whitehall security source said the existing terror threat level system was useful because it helped set “a reference point” to shape behaviour across Britain’s wider national security system. They questioned, however, whether a biosecurity centre would be able to make its assessments independently. “Technocratic measures are being politicised, and ‘blamestorming’ and political manoeuvring seem to be the order of the day at the moment,” they said.
Johnson said the UK was currently under the second highest level of threat, but the situation was improving. “Over the period of the lockdown, we have been in level four, and thanks to your sacrifice we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to level three.” The new system will apply only to England at first. Scotland has led criticism from the three devolved administrations of Downing Street’s decision to drop the “stay at home” slogan in favour of “stay alert”. No 10, however, said it would seek to work with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to create an integrated approach across the UK.
New Zealand adopted a four-tier coronavirus alert system in late March, in the early stages of the outbreak, so that “people can see and plan for the kinds of restrictions we may be required to put in place”, according to its government. Its guidelines cover how people are expected to behave at each level, how the healthcare system should be set up, and what public facilities and businesses are allowed to remain open. New Zealand, which has suffered relatively mildly from coronavirus compared with the UK and others in Europe, is poised to decide on Monday whether to reduce the threat level from three to two. Any decision has to be signed off by the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, and her cabinet."
2020-05-10T15:41:23Z,politics,Politics,"Keir Starmer 'failing renters' hit by coronavirus crisis, Momentum says","Momentum and thousands of Labour members have accused Keir Starmer of “failing renters”, calling on him to back an immediate cancellation of rents for those whose income is affected by the coronavirus crisis. Starmer’s policy is to support an extension of the three-month ban on evictions and give tenants up to two years to pay arrears, which Labour says would help avoid people losing their homes in June. However, activists are calling for a more comprehensive policy to help renters, saying a deferral of rents will push people further into poverty as they face huge rises in what they have to pay each month.
A letter signed by at least 4,000 Labour members, backed by Momentum, the leftwing grassroots group that supported Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, called on Starmer to improve the policy. Momentum has emailed its 40,000 members urging them to support the letter, which is also backed by Open Labour, a soft-left pressure group, who said: “Deferring rent payments is not enough. We encourage our members to sign and support #CancelTheRent.” In the open letter, the members write: “Deferrals do not confront the loss of income experienced by private renters, nor do they delay the eviction process. Universal credit is too slow-moving and not nearly enough to keep landlords from demanding rent. “Unfortunately, private renters cannot with much confidence look to the Labour party for comfort. While reforms to Universal Credit are welcomed, the Labour Party’s revised position of rent deferrals does not help us as workers. It simply pushes the problem down the road.” It says Starmer’s solutions are “simply not good enough” and amount to “failing renters”, arguing that three months of deferred rent will end up in a 12% rent increase over two years. The letter calls on Labour to “pressure the government to cancel, at the tenant’s request, payments of rent, for any tenant experiencing any drop in income” and “cover, at the tenant’s request, utility payments, for any tenant experiencing any drop in income”. A spokesman for Starmer pointed to a defence of the party’s policy by Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow housing secretary, who said: “The five-point plan aims to prevent arrears and debt primarily if possible and to minimise it and prevent evictions if not. There are huge problems with the housing system, which needs fixing. Right now we are trying to make sure people don’t lose their homes. ”The policy is that the government should support and protect people’s incomes to prevent arrears if possible, and prevent evictions if not. That doesn’t solve the whole housing crisis – that needs regulation of private rental sector, investment in truly affordable homes.”
She also highlighted an analysis by a legal expert that warns of unintended consequences if rents are completely cancelled as the state would have to compensate landlords, estimating the cost to the state at up to £6.4bn a month and claiming it would be “deeply regressive, giving the biggest benefit to those who don’t need it, [with] free money for the already reasonably well-off”. The Green party has used Starmer’s policy on renters as an opportunity to outflank Labour on the left and appeal to renters. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, said she disagreed with Labour, arguing that “leaving renters struggling with debt is unfair and will increase homelessness”. She said: “Instead, forgive arrears and let landlords who need it claim for support. Most renters already stretched and won’t have the ability to service two years of repayments.”"
2020-05-10T08:05:19Z,politics,Politics,"Covid-19: isolated and alone, Britain has become the sick man of Europe","Britain is in a lonely place right now. It resembles the scene of a bad traffic accident where shocked passers-by look away with pity and horror in their eyes. Alarmed by what they see, governments around the world practise their own form of social distancing. Once again, Britain is the sick man of Europe. Lethal mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic is not the sole reason for this un-splendid isolation. The disease’s sudden onslaught is the third national disaster in almost as many years. The first was the decision to walk away from Europe. The second was the advent of Donald Trump and his anarchic America First agenda. However the virus’s death toll is calculated, the perception is taking hold, abroad as at home, that the Johnson government’s performance is one of the world’s worst, second possibly only to the US. Sympathy for Britain’s plight has not forestalled scathing international criticism. Italians may surely be forgiven a sense of relief that their country is no longer Europe’s biggest blackspot. With this unwanted title came the unspoken inference that Italy was uniquely unprepared. Some in the UK certainly saw it that way. They thought they were immune. They were betting, as usual, on a bogus British exceptionalism. Britain “did not pay enough attention to what was happening here”, commented Beppe Severgnini in Corriere della Sera, referring to the two- to three-week period when Italy was ahead of the corona curve. The UK “lost the advantage that fate and Italy gave it... when it was obvious the virus was spreading”. The view of Britain as Europe’s “problem child” predates the pandemic but has been greatly reinforced by it. Foreign perceptions of the UK as a badly governed, disorderly, embittered and chronically divided country took deep root in the politically chaotic years that followed the 2016 Brexit referendum. It’s possible that outside observers who were surprised by the anger and passion aroused by Brexit simply did not understand Britain. But the stunning levels of incompetence, jingoism and arrogance displayed by the British side during the withdrawal talks dismayed many Europeans. It was genuinely unexpected. This altered view of Britain, or at least of Britain’s government, as a not entirely serious, capable or trustworthy partner is not confined to Europe. Given that Brexit is premised on “global Britain” forging a web of dynamic new trade relationships, such reputational damage is potentially calamitous. Unpropitious, too, is the current plunge towards a world recession. The WTO predicts that trade may decline by up to 34%. What is China, for example, to make of leaders who fail to clearly disassociate from Trump’s self-serving claims that Beijing deliberately spread what he calls the “Wuhan virus”? Huffing and puffing on the Tory right over Huawei hardly bolsters Britain’s claim to be a free-trade champion open for business.
Yet Boris Johnson’s government, ever more desperate for investment, is easy prey. Beijing’s “wolf warrior” diplomats will see the lack of substance at the heart of a remarkably low-calibre cabinet, and spot a chance for knockdown bargains. The age of the unequal treaty is back – with Britain the loser this time. What is true of China is true in spades of Trump’s America. Talks about a free-trade deal, begun last week, promise to expose the harsh reality of an isolated Britain’s feeble leverage vis-à-vis a relentlessly self-interested superpower. Lowered food safety standards may be among many enforced compromises. Yet the Trump presidency’s negative impact on British interests and values far surpasses disputes about chlorinated chicken. Since 2017, Trump has blasted many holes in the foundations of UK security, defence and foreign policy. Britain long counted the US its foremost friend and vital ally. Now that bond is breaking. On the climate crisis, on Iran, on Nato, on Israel-Palestine, on the UN and boycotted agencies such as the Human Rights Council, on multilateralism in general, on the primacy of international law, on relations with Vladimir Putin’s Russia, and on limiting new nuclear weapons, Trump has mostly ignored Britain’s views. To this sorry list of spats, splits and schisms may be added Trump’s support for big cuts in foreign aid, crude Islamophobia, the militarisation of space, commercial exploitation of the Arctic and his worrying contempt for democracy, honesty and accountability, as revealed by the Mueller inquiry and his Senate impeachment. What Johnson and Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, dare not admit, for it would wholly explode their Brexit fantasies, is that Trump’s America has become an unreliable, problematic and in some respects, hostile entity, with a tendency to belittle Britain, not build it up. His re-election would extend and intensify the nightmare. Trump, the greatest of all coronavirus failures, is dangerous to know. And yet still they hug him close, risking infection, petitioning for a deal at almost any cost, mimicking his anti-Europe, populist posturing, rejecting pandemic cooperation with the EU and insisting, even now, that Brexit will be sewn up by December. A stitch-up is more likely. It will end in tears. One disaster has swiftly followed another. Rarely in modern times has Britain’s place in the world looked so precarious. Rarely has its global reputation for competence, pragmatism and good sense been so battered and disrespected. Rarely have its people and economy faced such challenges and such crippling levels of debt. Perhaps the last time the country stood alone like this, frightened, sickened, beleaguered, lacking funds and resources and separated from friends, was when it faced a deadly invasion of a different type, 80 years ago next month. As it remembers the victory in Europe that eventually followed in 1945, Britain needs another miracle, a fresh strategy – and much better leaders."
2020-05-10T07:38:19Z,politics,Politics,"A century on, whatever happened to Labour's firebrand lost leader?","“Oh mad, foolish Grayson!” Editorial in the socialist magazine The Clarion, August 1907 In the aftermath of the general election of February 1974, the mood in Marsden socialist club in west Yorkshire was grim. David Clark, the young Labour MP for Colne Valley, in which the former mill town of Marsden sits, had lost his seat. Clark gamely attempted to lift his activists’ spirits with a rousing speech. But one elderly stalwart remained unmoved: “Old Harry was sitting at the bar nursing a pint,” recalls Clark, who is now 80 and a Labour peer. “He said: ‘All due respect to master Dave, but we’ve only ever had one true socialist MP around here. And that was Victor Grayson.’” Clark had heard this name many times before, always pronounced with a special reverence and a wistful sense of what might have been. With more time on his hands, he began to look into the story of the predecessor who inspired so much affection and emotion. What he discovered, and recorded in a recently updated biography, remains one of the most remarkable stories in the history of British politics and one of its biggest unsolved mysteries. For a brief period at the start of the last century, while still in his twenties, Victor Grayson became the most famous socialist in England and a potential Labour leader. Then, 100 years ago this September, he vanished without trace. As Clark puts it: “One day in 1920, he walked out of his apartment accompanied by two men and was never conclusively seen again. What happened has fascinated me for half a century.” Precocious radicalism Grayson made his name in the Colne Valley by-election of 1907. At the age of 26, fresh out of theological college in Manchester, he became the first avowedly socialist candidate to win a seat in parliament. It was a sensational victory. The Labour party, seven years old and led by Keir Hardie, had made its first major breakthroughs at the previous year’s general election. But this had been achieved through becoming, in effect, a junior partner to the Liberals, who stood aside in selected constituencies. Feeling their way, Labour’s first great leaders – Hardie, Philip Snowden and Ramsay MacDonald – were sticking to a mild programme of incremental reform to working conditions. Grayson’s precocious radicalism flamed across this horizon like a red comet. Colne Valley constituency, a mill-owners’ fiefdom, was a Liberal bastion that was believed to be unconquerable. Ignoring the reservations of the Labour leadership, Grayson took on the local political establishment, advocating revolutionary socialism and female suffrage. In his manifesto, he told the textile workers of the valley: “I do not believe that we are divinely destined to be drudges … the time for our emancipation has come.” Unbelievably, he won.
The result was national news. On the evening of Grayson’s victory, a special correspondent for the Daily Express wrote: “The Red Flag waves over Colne Valley today. The fever of Socialism has infected thousands of workers.” But it was the manner and style of Grayson’s campaign, as much as his politics, that made him, in the words of one of his supporters, “the darling of the socialist movement”. Handsome, genial and eloquent, Grayson seemed to be blessed with every political gift. An Irish priest who followed Grayson’s campaign wrote: “Never have I seen people so moved; least of all these Yorkshire people, whose main interest I always thought to be ‘t’brass’ – never have I seen crowds so swept by the Holy Spirit.” The evangelical zeal was supplemented with quicksilver repartee and jokes: “Any great orator needs humour and warmth,” says Clark. “Much of Grayson’s style was about making people laugh. There was a famous occasion when he stopped halfway through a speech and said to the women in this working-class audience, ‘Ladies, what do you think of my hair today?’” At dizzying pace, such playfulness could give way to withering denunciations. Grayson could be funny or he could be excoriating, as when telling one Yorkshire rally: “We count it not only unjust, but undignified, for able-bodied persons to eat luxurious food [and] wear extravagant clothes, live in many and princely houses, all produced by others who grovel on the margin of existence.” ‘Traitors to your class’ According to Jon Cruddas, the Labour MP for Dagenham and Rainham, Grayson was a shining light in an almost forgotten Labour tradition. “He was a kind of political preacher,” says Cruddas. “He came from the pulpit tradition and embodied a radical humanism that staked everything on a moral critique of early-20th-century capitalism. There was nothing doctrinaire or pseudo-scientific about his socialism, in contrast to some of the Marxist currents around at the time. It was a battle about dignity and ethics. But, of course, it became very sad, what happened.”
Grayson was an inspirational figure, but he was also flawed and vulnerable. An adopted child, there were persistent rumours that he was the illegitimate son of an aristocrat, which may have fuelled an insecurity that led to a growing alcohol problem. In London, he acquired a reputation for fine living which raised eyebrows in the non-conformist Pennines communities that had elected him. In parliament, he picked unwise fights with Labour colleagues. Six months after entering the House of Commons, Grayson was ordered from the chamber by the speaker after repeatedly disrupting a debate on temperance to talk about the plight of the unemployed. At the third time of asking he finally left, telling fellow Labour MPs: “I leave the House with pleasure. You are traitors to your class. You will not stand up for your class, you traitors.” It was the beginning of the end of a dazzling but short-lived parliamentary career. In the election of 1910, Grayson narrowly lost his seat in Colne Valley and his love of whisky was becoming a serious problem. He suffered nervous breakdowns. When, in 1914, he was found incapable of delivering a speech to a packed hall in Bradford, his loyal Yorkshire backers reluctantly cut their losses. As Clark writes in his biography: “A link which had lasted for ten years was severed – broken with regrets, for the Colne Valley activists had expected much, perhaps too much, from Victor Grayson. He had … given them their finest hour [but] the pressure was too great; his love of the good things of life proved too distracting. The whisky which had acted as his stimulant became his master.”
The first world war led to a wider and more acrimonious parting of the ways with old allies. The vast majority of Grayson’s radical supporters within Labour were passionately anti-war, although the party itself was split. Grayson, who had railed against Prussian militarism, backed the conflict, in which he would fight and be wounded. He became a poster boy of the government’s recruitment campaign, addressing rallies throughout Britain, as well as in Australia and New Zealand. In newspapers, he wrote fulsome appreciations of the then first lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill. An army medical report recorded that he was drinking a bottle of whisky a day while at the front. As support for the war drew him into new circles of influence, he was making dangerous but lucrative liaisons with such unlikely bedfellows as the newspaper proprietor, fraudster and populist patriot Horatio Bottomley. Beaten up on the Strand In 1920, the year he disappeared, Grayson was living in London, occupying an expensive suite of rooms in Piccadilly. Although he wrote occasional pieces of journalism, the income they generated would hardly have financed such lavish accommodation. Instead, Clark believes, after the war the former MP had turned to some form of blackmail. The natural generosity of spirit and joie de vivre had turned into something darker. “In political terms, he’d lost almost everything. He’d alienated the unions by calling their MPs traitors and he’d outraged the socialist left by backing the war. I think, when he came back, he must have calculated that the only way of maintaining his lifestyle was by exploiting the contacts he made with powerful establishment figures.” One of the regular visitors to Grayson’s apartment was a colourful and corrupt Whitehall fixer named Maundy Gregory. A peacock figure given to ostentatious displays of wealth, Gregory was said by a contemporary to habitually carry round “a wad of banknotes the size of a newly born baby’s head”. He had carved a postwar niche for himself illegally selling knighthoods, baronetcies and peerages on behalf of David Lloyd George’s government. In a public meeting of the time, Grayson summoned up some of the old fire: “The sale of honours,” he told his audience, “is a national scandal. It can be traced right down to 10 Downing Street, and to a monocled dandy with offices in Whitehall. I know this man and one day I will name him.” But Grayson never carried out the threat. “He was probably being paid, on the authority of Lloyd George, to shut his mouth,” says Clark. In mid-September 1920, Grayson was beaten up in the Strand. Then, at the end of the month, the young manageress of his apartment block, Hilda Porter, saw Grayson leave accompanied by two men with whom he had been in discussions all afternoon. Porter later said his last words were: “I’ll be in touch soon.” Was he murdered? For decades, that was the common assumption. But Clark now believes that Grayson was paid off for good and told to adopt a new identity. “Remember there was no television. It was possible even for well-known people to go unrecognised in a way that couldn’t happen now. I think, in 1920, Victor had tired of his superstar status. He had been terribly affected by the recent death of his wife, Ruth. Lloyd George may have got fed up paying him and Grayson was presented with an offer he couldn’t refuse.”
The theory is supported by an intriguing piece of testimony from a former Colne Valley comrade. In the 1930s, a veteran of the famous by-election of 1907 claimed to have tracked Grayson down to a furniture shop in London, which he said he owned. Ernest Marklew had himself become the Colne Valley MP in 1935. Shortly before his death, he told a Labour colleague that, after Grayson confirmed his identity, he begged Marklew to say nothing, as he had left public life. The exact details of the encounter, Clark thinks, were changed to protect him. Clark originally called his book about Grayson Labour’s Lost Leader. But, in truth, he says, the mercurial hero of Colne Valley would not have been right for that role. “The Labour party had opted against the revolutionary road to socialism and they were working at what they had to do – become an official opposition and start to appeal to people who hadn’t made the jump to socialist thinking. Gifted as he was, Grayson would not have had the temperament to deal with that.” But there can be no doubt that, in the unforgiving hills of the Pennines, he achieved something remarkable. Cruddas believes there are lessons to learn from Grayson’s astonishing ability to connect. “The modern left is in danger, at times, of looking soulless,” he says. “A mixture of doctrinaire edicts and liberal neutrality. The early Grayson came from a different, warmer tradition. His kind of radical humanism is exactly what the left needs today.” Soon after the triumph of 1907, when Grayson was still at the height of his powers, a fellow socialist tried to capture the impact he was making. “The children in the Colne Valley learn to pronounce his name,” wrote Wilfred Thompson in an early biography, “almost before they begin to say ‘Father’. Some are christened after him. It is a very common thing to see them sitting upon the edge of the platform at his meetings, almost before they can walk. Every Colne Valley child knows ‘Vitter Gayson’.” The memories were to remain long after the man had gone."
2020-05-10T06:33:17Z,politics,Politics,"Rosena Allin-Khan: 'If Matt Hancock found my tone difficult, that's on him'","When Rosena Allin-Khan stood up in the House of Commons last Tuesday to address the health secretary, Matt Hancock, she anticipated being stonewalled. She didn’t expect to become the story. In her other life, the MP for Tooting is an A&E doctor and intensive care specialist and has been working 12-hour hospital shifts throughout the pandemic. Allin-Khan reported that the government’s failures were contributing to a greater loss of life and she wanted answers on its testing strategy. The health secretary awkwardly responded by suggesting that Allin-Khan’s testimony was untrue and moreover, that she “might do well to take a leaf out of the shadow secretary of state’s book in terms of tone”. “Watch your tone!” Allin-Khan exhales, still in mild disbelief. “I have written to the government several times since March, asking why we haven’t followed WHO guidelines, asking for clearer messaging on social distancing, urging for more PPE. I’ve had no response. I was bringing messages from the frontline,” she says over the phone from her home in south London. The exchange went viral after she tweeted it, morphing into a meme online then as a talking point on Good Morning Britain, Sky News, BBC News, LBC and beyond. Being patronised by Hancock was one thing, but to be dismissed so audaciously on the day the UK reported the highest death toll in Europe galls her. “I was very courteous in my delivery. If Matt Hancock found it difficult, that’s on him. Addressing the fact that lives could have been saved and families’ hearts might not have been broken had we got on top of testing earlier? These are legitimate questions that people all across the country have. I was very polite. He didn’t like the content, so instead felt it easier to make a derogatory comment towards me.” Allin-Khan says she is used to confounding people. Her mother is Polish and her father is Pakistani and she grew up in a poor household in the constituency she now represents as “a proud British Muslim”. She describes her upbringing as “difficult … turbulent”. She won’t elaborate out of sensitivity towards her parents, except to say it meant “I failed my A-levels spectacularly”. Nonetheless, at 24, Allin-Khan ended up reading medicine at Cambridge and gained a masters in public health before working as a doctor in disaster zones across the world. “People are still confused by who I am or what I am,” she says, of the layers of ignorance she has navigated her whole life. “The biggest learning journey I have had as a politician is seeing how much I can be hated for being eastern European, for being Pakistani, for being Muslim. I never came from a political background. The vitriol shocked me.” At 42, alongside her constituency work, Allin-Khan serves as a shadow cabinet minister for mental health and is an amateur boxer, wife, and mother to two children under six. She stopped her campaign for Labour’s deputy leadership in March and then went to work treating Covid-19 patients at St George’s hospital in south London and at the newly opened Nightingale. The experience has been harrowing and frightening.
“Families are begging me for a miracle I can’t give them. You’re unable to console them with a hug or a touch on the shoulder. You have to watch their hearts break, you’re the one delivering goodbye messages to their loved ones,” Allin-Khan takes a pause. “Messages like ‘please hold on, Dad’, ‘please hold on for the kids’ – it puts chills through your body but you have to hold it together and stay strong for these families. It is very hard to do.” At home, her children have been taught not to run to her until she has stripped her clothes into the washing machine and showered. She uses separate cutlery, crockery and towels from her family and has found herself in tears “wondering about how many of all those deaths could have been avoided”. She has found the clapping for key workers “a wonderful way for communities to feel they are supporting frontline staff. It’s an opportunity to say thank you”. But she is scornful that it is “a pointless exercise if government ministers clap, but don’t provide resources the NHS needs”. Allin-Khan became a Labour councillor during her first maternity leave in 2014, winning “in a local ward that had been Conservative for 24 years”. Two years later, just after the birth of her second child, Sadiq Khan left his Tooting seat to become mayor of London and Allin-Khan was encouraged to stand. There were 119 candidates up for selection and she found the campaign gruelling; the Daily Mail published old photos of her in a bikini, claiming that the working-class doctor had in fact been a secret swimwear model with “a glamorous past”. At the time, she was distraught. “That people would be out there trying to tarnish my character over something that wasn’t true and deliberately using my ethnicity and religion to try and humiliate me was upsetting. It can be all-consuming.” But she says she kept on “because I have a work ethic that means that once I commit to doing something, I give 2,000%”.
Allin-Khan was elected the day MP Jo Cox was murdered in 2016. “It was horrific,” she says flatly, at the time unsure of what she had got herself into. Allin-Khan claims not to have any political heroes – “mine are more everyday heroes” – but says she became more interested in politics at university. “The Labour party did change my life and gave me opportunities that wouldn’t have happened under the status quo,” she says. “It wouldn’t have been possible for someone with a background like mine to have gone to medical school otherwise.” Witnessing the erosion of the health service firsthand has been a prime motivator for her political energy. “I am so grateful to be doing the work I always did, but now I have MP after my name and suddenly people are interested. I can use my platform to be a voice for the voiceless.” It is indisputable to Allin-Khan that coronavirus has escalated a system already in crisis. “Uncertainty breeds anxiety. Labour wants to support the government to get this right. Our priority is protecting public health, but we do need a consensus on what happens next.” Is there a sense that criticism has been tempered in the Commons chamber for the sake of fostering national unity? “Nobody likes political point-scoring, but it is a challenge not to be able to scrutinise decisions that affect the whole country. Things like Boris Johnson announcing a press conference on Sunday to decide the future of the country? That sort of announcement should be made in parliament where there can be due diligence and scrutiny.” The Public Health England review into why so many BAME people are dying disproportionately from Covid-19 fills her with similar frustration. “I have reservations about the review and how it will be conducted.” Referring to the controversial appointment to the review of Trevor Phillips, the former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission who has been suspended from the Labour party over allegations of Islamophobia, she says: “We need to have trust in this review. Our BAME communities deserve it.” Allin-Khan says she was underestimated at the beginning of her political career, but that it only fuelled her to keep going. “I’m an ordinary woman living an extraordinary life, and I am driven very much by what is right and what is wrong,” she says. “If I lose my seat tomorrow, I will have been grateful to have represented my community and saved as many lives as I could. That’s why when Matt Hancock said what he said, I just thought no. No, I won’t watch my tone – I’ve got something I need to say.”
• This article was amended on 10 May 2020 because an earlier version said that Allin-Khan “dropped out of Labour’s deputy leadership campaign in March”. To clarify: she stopped campaigning in order to work hospital shifts but she stayed in the race."
2020-05-09T21:32:07Z,politics,Politics,"More people think UK has handled coronavirus worse than Spain and Italy, poll shows","More people in this country now believe the UK has performed worse than Italy, Spain and France in the Covid-19 crisis than say it has done better than its European neighbours, according the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. The data shows that only the United States is judged by a majority of people in the UK to have fared worse. While two weeks ago more people thought that the UK had done better than Italy and Spain, now the reverse is the case.
The findings come after a week in which the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the UK had the highest total of deaths from Covid-19 of any European nation. The ONS said 29,648 deaths had been registered in England and Wales with Covid-19 mentioned on the death certificate by 2 May. With the addition of the official death figures for Scotland and Northern Ireland, this took the total to 32,313 – the highest of any country in Europe. While ministers have been keen to point out that international comparisons are difficult to make, it appears that the rise of the UK death toll above those of other nations has shifted public opinion about the effectiveness of the UK response. Two weeks ago, when Opinium asked people whether the UK had responded better or worse than Italy, 30% said it had done better and 22% worse. When asked the same question between Tuesday and Thursday of last week, 29% said the UK had done worse and 25% better. There was a similar turnaround in relation to Spain with 29% believing the UK had handled things worse and 22% better in the latest poll. Opinium also found that more people had come to the view that the UK had done worse in comparison to South Korea, Japan and Australia than two weeks ago. Overall more people still approve of the way the UK has handled the crisis (48% approve against 36% who disapprove) though the net approval rate (the figure when the proportion of those who disapprove is subtracted from the proportion who approve) is at its lowest level (plus 12) since Opinium began polling on coronavirus in March.
On specific aspects of the crisis, 60% disapprove of the way the government has handled testing for Covid-19. This follows the government announcing it had hit the 100,000 test per day 10 days ago only to fail to meet that target again on any single day last week. With some lockdown restrictions potentially being eased from Monday, the majority of people are still cautious about reopening public places. Fewer than one in 10 think schools (8%), offices (8%) and non-essential shops (9%) should reopen immediately. Similarly, the public seem uncomfortable with the idea of visiting public places or using public transport even after restrictions are lifted. Three in five (60%) say they would not feel comfortable eating in a restaurant, while over half would feel uncomfortable using the underground (55%) or travelling by bus or train (59% and 56% respectively). Meanwhile, opinion is more divided on returning to offices; over a third (36%) would feel uncomfortable going back to working in an office, while 30% would feel comfortable."
2020-05-09T11:53:24Z,politics,Politics,UK plans £250m boost for cycle lanes and fast-track e-scooter trials,"The government is expected to unveil a £250m investment in UK cycle lanes to encourage commuters to ride to work instead of using public transport, as part of the effort to prevent a resurgence of coronavirus. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, is expected to make the funding announcement during his appearance at the Downing Street coronavirus briefing on Saturday. There are also plans to fast-track trials of the use of e-scooters on British roads, according to the Press Association. Currently, electric scooters – which can travel at up to 15.5mph – are banned on roads and pavements in the UK.
The government launched a consultation about legalising e-scooters in March and would need to pass secondary legislation to legalise their use. Campaigners have called for a fundamental redesign of the transport system to help prevent a bounce-back in air pollution levels once the lockdown ends. Studies have shown that air pollution may play a role in higher Covid-19 mortality rates, with hearts and lungs weakened by dirty air. In Italy, coronavirus was detected in air pollution samples by scientists who are investigating whether this could enable it to be carried over longer distances and increase the number of people infected. Nine organisations including Greenpeace and the Transport Action Network have written an open letter to the UK secretaries of state for transport and the environment, as well as the chancellor, leaders of local and regional authorities and city mayors. “It would be completely absurd if, after the unprecedented efforts and sacrifices made to save thousands of lives from Covid-19, we allowed thousands more to be cut short by the devastating impacts of toxic pollution,” the letter reads. The group’s demands include wider pavements, protected cycle tracks and the installation of bus gates, bollards and planters to limit traffic in residential and shopping streets. The letter also calls for networks of low-traffic neighbourhoods and for walking and cycling to be prioritised along main roads. Greenpeace UK, CPRE, Cycling UK, the Environmental Defence Fund, Global Action Plan, Living Streets, Possible, Transport Action Network, and Transport and Environment have signed the letter. The campaigners also suggest introducing a 20mph speed limit in built-up areas and a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030. Restrictions brought in to tackle the coronavirus pandemic have led to a huge drop in road traffic and a fall in air pollution of up to 60% in parts of the UK. A YouGov poll commissioned by Greenpeace UK found 71% of people were concerned about the possibility of air pollution returning to pre-lockdown levels once restrictions are lifted. It also found that 58% backed the introduction of cycle lanes on urban main roads along with increased government funding for walking and cycling infrastructure. The letter calls for immediate action to lock in some of the reduction in road traffic and the introduction of measures to ensure that “when the nation gets moving again, it does so in a cleaner, safer way”. Rebecca Newsom, Greenpeace UK’s head of politics, said Milan and Brussels had already taken steps to prioritise walkers and cyclists in their city centres. “There are many things about the lockdown people will be glad to leave behind, but cleaner air is not one of them,” she said. “Yet there’s a real risk that congestion and toxic pollution will be back on our streets as soon as restrictions are lifted.”"

2020-05-08T16:49:02Z,politics,Politics,Lisa Nandy: UK faces 'serious reckoning' about global role,"Lisa Nandy has said the government’s “go it alone” approach left Britain unable to to prepare for the coronavirus crisis as she urged Boris Johnson to spearhead international cooperation to create and distribute a vaccine. In her first newspaper interview since becoming shadow foreign secretary, the former Labour leadership candidate said the aftermath of the pandemic should mark a “serious reckoning” about Britain’s role in the world. She criticised the “myth of exceptionalism”, which she said was part of the country’s self-image. “Britain was in that position, where our government had increasingly taken an isolationist route, and championed the idea of a small island nation that would go it alone, and punch above its weight, without stopping to think about how we were going to exert power and influence in the world, particularly with China and the US taking the approach that they’ve taken,” Nandy said. “What we’ve learned in this pandemic is that that global Britain approach that was supposed to put Britain first, has actually ended up putting us last – and that in the future we’re going to have a serious reckoning about how Britain does form alliances across the world, that enable us to not just survive future pandemics and global shocks, but actually to thrive during some very very difficult times.” She welcomed that fact that Britain co-hosted a pledging conference with the EU last week, to raise funding for vaccine development, and described the race to discover one as “the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes”. But she pointed out that the US was not involved in the conference – and a rival event was held on the same day, in which the Indian government, among others, was involved.
“Unless we get a global response, we’ll see countries scrabbling for a vaccine in competition with one another. It means that the development of that vaccine will undoubtedly be slower, and lives will be lost as a consequence,” she said. “It also leaves the UK in a particularly vulnerable position, because we don’t have the manufacturing capacity here. We’ll be reliant on other countries, many of which weren’t present in those discussions on Monday. So we need a global agreement, not just about developing a vaccine, but then about manufacturing, and then about equitable access.” She urged Britain to do more to facilitate a global response. “There are a series of crunch moments coming up – key summits around the world – where it will be determined whether we can forge a global response, whether we can persuade drug companies to pull patents, for example, whether we can get an agreement about what an equitable distribution of the vaccine would look like. “We’ve got a government that has made much of our special relationship with the United States, we need to be reaching across the Atlantic and ensuring that America comes to the table, and that we get a genuine global response to the crisis.” She added: “Unless we deal with this now, we’re going to find, just like with PPE, with testing, with the furlough scheme, with all of the issues that we’ve had to confront as a country, that we’re not prepared, and that we’re behind the curve.” Starmer’s frontbench have been cautious in their criticism of the government’s handling of the pandemic, believing the national mood favoured a constructive approach. But shadow ministers have stepped up their attacks in recent days, with Starmer using an article in the Daily Telegraph on Friday to accuse Johnson of failing to protect veterans in care homes. Nandy said Britain was one of those countries where a “myth of exceptionalism” had taken hold, leading to “an enormous divergence” in the way the outbreak has been tackled, creating problems for citizens and businesses. “Even this week, with the newly launched app on the Isle of Wight, there’s been a discussion in government about whether they now need to change the technology they’re using around that app, to bring them in line with other countries,” she said. “If we don’t start to get this right, and to see the world pulling together, we will continue to see those problems and those barriers.”
The 40-year-old’s appointment was one of the surprises in the radical reshuffle carried out by Keir Starmer after he won the Labour leadership last month. She had impressed many party members with assured media performances during her own campaign for the leadership, but was better known for championing the needs of towns like her Wigan constituency than for her views on foreign policy. Nandy said her “mission” in the post would be to “connect back together what is happening to people in places like Wigan, and what is happening at that multilateral level - and why those two things might work in tandem and why they matter so much”. She highlighted what she sees as a “crisis of legitimacy” for globalisation, which fed the rise of populist leaders, including Donald Trump, and the Brexit vote in 2016. “One of the things that is foremost in my mind is that the globalisation model that we had has become completely unsustainable in large parts of the world. And that is as true here in Britain as it is for example in the USA,” she said.
Nandy said Starmer’s Labour would continue to be an internationalist party. “It is working-class people, and the poorest, in countries all over the world including Britain, who are bearing the brunt of this. So if we don’t work together to resolve it, that will continue, and we can’t allow that to happen,” she said. “We can already see the nationalist, populist forces line up, to say that the world must pull apart in response to this. And we have to say that we’re part of that global response - and Labour is an alternative pole on the UK landscape, that puts internationalism very firmly back at the heart of what constitutes a progressive agenda for Britain.” Nandy also suggested Britain be more cautious in its relations with China. Aspects of China’s behaviour, she said, “should give us cause for concern, and they should make us much more vigilant.” But she added: “There is no global problem that you can solve without China.” A government spokesperson said: “From the start of the crisis the UK has played a leading role in tackling the spread of coronavirus and driving the world’s response to it. We are uniquely placed to do so as a member of the G7, G20, Nato, Commonwealth and the UNSC, and as a major donor to the global health system. “The UK is the biggest contributor to the international body leading the search for a coronavirus vaccine, and to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. We are also hosting the virtual Global Vaccine Summit on 4 June. The UK has now pledged £744m in aid to support global efforts to combat the outbreak.”"
2020-05-08T04:00:17Z,politics,Politics,Once again a battle-scarred Britain must find a new role in the world,"In making his landmark post-Brexit speech in February under Sir James Thornhill’s baroque painted ceiling in the Royal Hospital, Greenwich, Boris Johnson believed he had found the perfect setting to paint his own picture of Britain charting a new course as a free-trading, independent, open and liberal nation. Like the painting above him, eulogising the triumph of William and Mary over the popish and tyrannical French, Johnson’s speech was an optimistic and patriotic piece of work. It offered a distinctive vision of British prosperity and diplomatic superiority. The speech had no hint that the world he described, and Britain’s place in it, was under any existential threat. But the past three months have left UK foreign policy thinkers suddenly searching in the fog for Britain’s future role in this changed world. Indeed, as the UK prepares to celebrate VE Day, the institutional order created by the west following the defeat of Germany, and on which Johnson’s vision rested, seems after 75 years finally to be coming apart. Those institutions, in which the UK thrived, are either paralysed, or a battleground. Covid-19, an invisible enemy, but deadlier than the blitz, has exacerbated and accelerated trends recalibrating risk, revealing new Great Powers and placing all UK diplomatic alliances under scrutiny. Sir Simon McDonald, the foreign office senior mandarin, says it is a “watershed moment for humanity”, and a chance for “a world reset”. Ministers have postponed the foreign and security policy review, due to have been published this autumn, to devote time to fighting the virus. Yet the UK’s most senior diplomats, including at foreign office executive committee level, are already examining Britain’s strategic posture. The question of the UK’s greatest ally, the US, currently, in the words of the former foreign secretary David Miliband, “a flagship for dysfunction” can be set aside until the US elections. For most British analysts, the most pressing foreign policy question for the UK will be its relations with China. Will the divisions between the US and China deepen so much that, regardless of the outcome of the US election, all nations, including the UK, are sucked into its vortex, requiring Britain to choose? If so, multilateral solutions become harder. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has spoken of the need for “a deep dive” into the role of China, adding vaguely: “We cannot have business as usual.” The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has backed an inquiry. The mood towards Beijing on the Tory benches, already sceptical, is turning ugly and suggests at minimum that the Huawei deal will not survive in its current form, placing other Chinese infrastructure projects in the UK at question. “We are all paying the price for Beijing’s decision to ignore the science, prioritise trade – and put the rest of the world’s health at risk,” says Tom Tugendhat, the liberal internationalist chair of the foreign affairs select committee. His committee is relentlessly pressing the foreign office for clear strategy on China. It’s clear that his committee will at minimum demand the UK adopt takeover rules that sees Chinese investment as a security risk. Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s former special adviser and a long-term China sceptic, has lambasted “David Cameron’s Operation Kowtow” and identified the chief culprit as George Osborne and the Treasury. He says: “Just as Harold Macmillan had perceived that, as British power declined, we should play Athens to America’s Rome, Mr Osborne thought he could pull off a geopolitical pivot that would strengthen Britain for decades to come.” Echoing the US State Department, Timothy adds: “It is surely now obvious that China is also a strategic rival to the west as a whole. It is an autocratic and oppressive state, with wildly different values and interests to our own. Its policy towards Asia, Africa and elsewhere is inevitably imperialistic. And its modus operandi – setting debt traps for countries to gain leverage over them and engaging in mass industrial espionage – is a danger to our interests and those of our allies.”
In this context, British alliances with Japan and South Korea, rivals to China, will be at a premium. But a faultline on China is emerging in the Tory party. The Foreign Office is urging caution, making the case for keeping a few bridges unburnt. The former foreign secretary Lord Hague told Policy Exchange: “We can’t solve global problems without China. And global problems are some of our most pressing and obviously most existential. The Covid-19 crisis is an example of such a dramatic world crisis. So we can’t be dependent on China, but we can’t be without a framework of cooperation with China.” McDonald agrees: “There is no problem that the world faces today that can be addressed, still less solved, without the active participation of China.” Miliband also argues that a balance needs striking. He says he has no illusions about China. “It is obvious that the Chinese state is being very confident in its response to Covid-19, describing it both as a success and the product of its one-party system. Their message is being effectively delivered – through aid supplies and diplomatic outreach around the world. It is much harsher than before, with crackdowns at home and favour-buying abroad.” But that does not mean cooperation with China should be seen as appeasement, Miliband argues. “We need to worry about a democratic recession, and the debate about whether democracies or autocracies coped best in this crisis is materially relevant to lives around the world, but it is really important this debate does end up excluding the need for institutions that encompass both democratic and autocratic regimes.” China is not just a seminar discussion for the UK. Britain needs China on board if its chairmanship of the UN climate change conference, set for Glasgow in November but now delayed until the middle of next year, is to be a success. Even now the best UK diplomats are pressing China to adopt bolder carbon emission targets for 2030. McDonald has said he hopes the coronavirus crisis will lead to greater Chinese ambition. “Build back better” has long been part of UK disaster relief thinking, and has now become the slogan of those preparing green post-coronavirus stimulation packages. But there are countervailing forces. Many of the building blocks for Glasgow have been removed. An EU-China meet-up scheduled for September and seen as a moment for China to float new targets has been cancelled. A Chinese-hosted conference on biodiversity, a chance to discuss carbon sinks and nature based solutions, has also been postponed, while governments are under pressure to save industries such as aviation. Above all, even under a Democrat presidency, relations between China and the US will be on a downward curve, making a climate change agreement more difficult. Tim Benton, head of the Chatham House energy and environment programme, foresees an uphill task for Britain’s diplomats. He argues that: “Any tension that undermines the existing international architecture – whether it is WTO, WHO, UNFCCC [the UN framework convention on climate change] – anything that creates stress is going to get in the way of reaching climate change targets. “You can imagine there is so much to-ing and fro-ing between major powers vying for their own nationalistic interest that climate change just gets pushed further down the agenda because economic reconstruction is seen as so much more important.” Economic reconstruction leads to the Brexit question. For many diplomats, the thought of piling a no-deal Brexit on to a £300bn coronavirus hit to the UK economy looks less like an act of self-harm, and more like a death wish. McDonald, speaking to the foreign affairs select committee, held out the faint hope that it was still an open question whether the PM might yet revisit the timetable. Robin Niblett, Chatham House director, senses Johnson will not delay, but instead look for a short-form agreement. “If you think that by the summer, the politics may get nastier with inquests about how we got into quite such a mess, and the money for what was called levelling up has been diverted to survival – the survival of businesses and the economy – then Johnson may feel politically he has to follow through on Brexit. Once you delay, you lose your agency and Brexit is about agency, as much as it is about control.” Miliband predicts the UK and the EU might settle for an outline deal that leaves details to be negotiated. Either way, the integrated review will have to work with changed assumptions about both resources and security. “The budget for global Britain promises to be brutal,” Niblett says. In the UK, growth is due to fall 7% this year. The World Trade Organization sees world trade declining by between 13% and 34%. Covid’s lasting legacy may be a switch away from just-in-time imports towards shorter supply chains and national sourcing. In this deglobalising world, Johnson’s promise in Greenwich to be “a superhero champion” of free trade looks incongruous. The US – with which the UK seeks to sign a signature free-trade deal – is in free fall. Yet Johnson fervently believes that the coronavirus only strengthens the case for a free-trade deal. Any scrap of extra growth becomes important. At the same time, definitions of security are in flux. In the view of Professor Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, the virus ranks alongside the cold war or 9/11 in terms of its security implications. The original concept of the walled state as protector has been reasserted, but the case for traditional defence spending has weakened. The army has had its role in the UK crisis, but the aircraft carrier has proved irrelevant, acting as much as an incubator as a shield from the virus. If the new stealth bomber is a pathogen, vaccines are the new missile defence system. In a post-coronavirus comprehensive spending review it will be health and not defence that will be first in the queue for the distribution of dwindling resources, Chalmers suggests. Beatrice Heuser, professor of international relations at Glasgow University, predicts defence officials “will have to cook their books like hell to reach the Nato target of spending at 2% of GDP”. There is a final issue for Britain: relevance. Many analysts also fear that the UK’s credibility as a leading convening power on the whole nexus of issues of the climate crisis, global health and development has taken a hit by its performance over coronavirus. Bill Gates may right to say that no country is likely to get an A grade for its pandemic preparedness, but judging by the European press the UK is currently near the bottom of the class, labelled, rightly or wrongly, as leading on “herd immunity” and then abandoning the policy. Niblett argues that “Brexit was such a shock to people that thought Britain was pragmatic and had a sense of its national interest. Now the almost wilful lack of preparation over coronavirus makes it feel like Britain just assumed it was separate, an island off the coast of Europe, and it has discovered it is not. It does play into a lethal combination of incompetence and hubris that has been used against Britain for a while now.
“On global health we will have taken a knock. Even though our scientific and university calling card remains unparalleled, the NHS was held up to a mirror and it has been shown at best to be underfunded. We could be put into an Anglo–US box of just-in-time living, and that seems less worthy of imitation. Soft power is all about attraction and people wishing to imitate you.” Miliband also issues a warning that Britain will need to be “brutally honest about its mistakes or risk irrelevance”. He sees one cause of optimism. “This may be the first global crisis where it is British universities seeking a vaccine, British companies developing contact tracing apps, British NGOs framing global connections. It is these institutions that may lead government rather than government provide the lead.” The Foreign Office is also urging Johnson to recognise there is a hard-won reputation on which he can draw. As far back as 2008, the UK government published a cross-government white paper entitled “health is global”. The paper argued that health should be seen as “an agent for good in foreign policy” so the UK was in at the birth of health diplomacy. The UK may have been trounced in the election to head the WHO in 2017, but there are influential Brits all around the international health set-up. UK’s strong medical research base, large aid budget and an interventionist mindset gives Johnson the platform from which to engage. The natural instinct within Whitehall is to be a player, but it will require leadership that only a prime minister can provide. Greenwich, according to Nicholas Hawksmoor, writing in 1728, was chosen as the site of Royal Hospital because it was located on the bend in the river “in the View of all the World and in the Sight of the Grand Emporium London”. The nation’s wealth and global outlook were seen as interdependent. It will be up to Johnson to decide if and how he honours that tradition."

2020-05-07T19:13:06Z,politics,Politics,"With the PM in hiding, Raab takes cover behind 'the science'","On the day the prime minister was legally obliged to review the government’s lockdown regulations, you might have thought that Boris Johnson would want to appear in person to say nothing was changing. Though it might do on Sunday. And there again it might not. It all depended on the scientific advice, almost all of which ministers had so far failed to understand. Still, they could always hope an extra few days might make all the difference. But faced with a genuine crisis, Boris has morphed from someone who would do anything to appear on TV into a virtual recluse. Reality and Boris have only ever been on nodding terms at best. So it was left to Dominic Raab to take the hit at the daily Downing Street press conference. The foreign secretary’s instructions had been clear. Make it plain that your prime function is to say you haven’t a clue what’s going to happen on Sunday – and even if you did, you couldn’t tell – and take as long as you like to say as little of any interest as possible. Dom had eagerly accepted. After all, not knowing very much was his specialist subject.
At first it had all gone pretty much like clockwork. Before taking the podium, Raab had shot himself up with a magic cocktail of Mogadon and beta blockers so there was barely a hint of the usual Psycho Dom as he put himself and his audience to sleep. Yes, the death rate did appear to be a lot higher in the UK than elsewhere in Europe, but perhaps it was time for people to stop being so negative. Rather than concentrating on the gloomy stuff, why not celebrate the fact that so many of us were still alive. In fact, at 8pm that night, when people went out into the street to applaud NHS staff and care workers, maybe they should give themselves an extra clap for having managed not to die. Dom quickly glossed over the fact that the government had now missed its 100,000 daily tests target five days in a row – it was the media’s fault for being dumb enough to imagine the target had ever been expected to be met – before going into a long explanation about why he didn’t have anything more to say. The R rate was now somewhere between 0.5 and 0.9, so whatever changes to the lockdown Boris might make on Sunday would probably be largely cosmetic at best. All he could guarantee, though, was that the prime minister would provide a roadmap to recovery. Though sadly, from the first draft he had been shown, all routes out ended in a cul-de-sac. It was when the questions started that the press conference began to rather fall apart. Understandably, most people wanted to know why Boris had appeared to be far more optimistic about the possibility of easing restrictions at prime minister’s questions the day before, when the key message Raab had delivered was that bugger all was going to change. Boris had promised a world of infinite possibilities of picnics and sunbathing – even if they were inconveniently timed to coincide with the end of the bank holiday weekend. The foreign secretary had promised next to nothing.
Dom’s drug-glazed eyes betrayed a flicker of panic. He longed to say that Boris was becoming ever more detached from reality by the day and was now borderline delusional. So no one should ever believe a word he says. But he loved his job too much for that. Dom is nothing if not a masochist. So instead he went into denial: the prime minister had never promised anything and all the treats that had been briefed to large sections of the government-friendly newspapers by No 10 the night before were basically figments of the media’s imagination. He had no idea how so many journalists could have got the same story so wrong. That, though, was merely the beginning of Dom’s nightmare. Because while he had been medicating himself into a state of mindlessness ahead of the press conference, other journalists had been listening to the science select committee where John Edmunds, a key member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, had said that the R rate had actually gone up to between 0.75 and 1.0, largely because of increased transmission in hospitals and care homes. Something, Ian Diamond, head of the Office for National Statistics, was only too happy to confirm. The days when the scientists acted as government stooges are long over. Everyone knows there’s a public inquiry coming down the track as soon as the pandemic is over, and no one is willing to be hung out to dry as the fall guy. “Um, we’ve always been guided by the science,” Raab garbled, defaulting to the standard script of any minister who knows he’s been landed in the shit. So the science had told the government to completely ignore the results of Exercise Cygnus in 2016 by failing to adequately prepare care homes for a possible pandemic. So the science had also told Johnson to basically do nothing for 10 days in February while he sorted out his personal life. So the science had led the government to be desperately short of PPE and testing equipment. So the science had pointed the UK towards the highest death rate in Europe.
Dom could feel a tightness in his chest as his heart started racing. Time to end the press conference as soon as indecently possible. It had been a car crash, but then he’d secretly never expected any other outcome. Because it wasn’t just him that was clueless, it was the entire cabinet. Still, he’d done his bit. And in three days time, Boris would have to come out of hiding and explain that he didn’t know what he was doing either. There was no roadmap. Just a picture of a donkey with pins nowhere near its tail. The plan was just hit and hope. Which was only marginally better than no plan at all. • This article was amended on 11 May 2020. The head of the Office for National Statistics is Ian Diamond, not Neil Diamond as stated in an earlier version."
2020-05-07T17:50:13Z,politics,Politics,"PM will announce modest changes to UK lockdown, says Raab","The UK should expect only modest changes to the lockdown restrictions when Boris Johnson addresses the nation on Sunday, Dominic Raab has said. The foreign secretary said at the daily press conference in Downing Street that while the government was in the position to think about the next phase of its pandemic response, people should continue to follow physical distancing guidelines over the bank holiday weekend. The prime minister had earlier said changes would be introduced from Monday, but Raab would not be drawn on rumoured changes such as allowing sunbathing or more outdoor exercise. He said: “As we enter another long bank holiday weekend I think the message is very clear: follow the guidance. There is no change today in the guidance or in the rules, but the prime minister will set out a roadmap on Sunday. “Any changes in the short-term will be modest, small and incremental, very carefully monitored, and as for now there’s no changes.” In effect the lockdown has been extended beyond the official review point of 7 May until more information is released on Sunday. Temperatures are expected to be as high as 26C over the weekend in London and south-east England, which has led to fears people may break the lockdown rules. Downing Street has said it is still receiving scientific advice on what the next steps should be and is considering setting out plans based on a number of “milestones”. Sir Ian Diamond, the head statistician for the ONS, said all the data he had seen showed the importance of physical distancing and he expected it would need to be maintained. He said the “R” number – the rate of transmission – was below one. However, R had gone up since the last estimates because of the rise of cases in care homes. “We need certainly to get on top of the epidemic in care homes and in hospitals,” he said. Raab said R was down overall, and especially in London, but he admitted that a “challenge remains in care homes”. Temperature checking – as South Korea, for example, has implemented at airports, workplaces and restaurants – will not be rolled out in the UK as part of its coronavirus strategy, Raab confirmed. He said he would look at the scientific advice but “temperature tests are not a particularly effective way of proceeding”. The deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries, said the likelihood of finding someone at the exact point they have a temperature related to coronavirus was very small, and some people presented with different symptoms. She said: “We want to catch people in the early phase of the disease where they are most likely to transmit, and not all of them will have a temperature.” Figures released by the government showed that it missed its 100,000 daily tests target for a sixth 24-hour period in a row since 30 April."
2020-05-07T14:30:03Z,politics,Politics,Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre held pandemic exercise in January,"The Home Office took part in a pandemic contingency exercise at an immigration removal centre as early as January, it has emerged, prompting questions about how much the government knew about the forecast scale of the Covid-19 outbreak. Sarah Burnett, the business operations director for justice and immigration at Serco, told MPs that the exercise took place at the Yarl’s Wood immigration centre with the involvement of the Home Office and Northamptonshire healthcare trust.
Addressing the home affairs select committee, Burnett said the exercise allowed those involved to ensure they had sufficient stocks of personal protection equipment (PPE). Colin Dobell, the managing director at Mitie Care & Custody, similarly told the committee that a pandemic contingency exercise took place with the Home Office at the Heathrow immigration removal centre (IRC) in February, allowing it to start reducing the numbers in detention in early March. The Labour MP Stephen Doughty asked the pair if they were surprised that the formal imposition of lockdown conditions did not happen until 23 March. Dobell replied: “We were communicating with Home Office all the way through it. It was clear from late February into early March what the strategy would be, which was really to reduce the number of detainees in the IRC. “We saw that take effect from early March, so from 8 March onwards the numbers in detention started to reduce dramatically.” The committee also heard evidence from providers of asylum seeker accommodation at Clearsprings Ready Homes and Mears Group, saying testing was not available for their service users despite hundreds of them isolating and living in accommodation with shared areas. Taking questions from the Conservative MP Laura Farris, Burnett said: “At Yarl’s Wood we held a full pandemic contingency planning exercise at the end of January, which ensured we were as prepared as we could be.” She added: “This was done at our instigation but with the Home Office and our healthcare partners Northampton healthcare trust. We worked on that as a tripartite plan which enabled us to get to a position where we could ensure we had sufficient stocks of PPE for example but also to redesign the regime to ensure we could continue to deliver essential services while maintaining the social distancing controls.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “There is nothing unusual in immigration removal centres having contingency plans in place for the spread of communicable diseases and these are tested on a regular basis. Immigration removal centres are following all Public Health England advice and if a detainee presents as symptomatic they have access to tests and appropriate medical care.” After the hearing, Doughty said: “It was deeply concerning to hear that many residents and even staff across the asylum accommodation system do not appear to have been able to access testing, despite large numbers becoming symptomatic, which itself is unsurprising given the nature of shared accommodation. “It was also revealing that providers appear to have been asked to carry out more extensive pandemic planning from January onwards. This suggests that the Home Office internally knew that the pandemic was likely to worsen and spread in the UK and throws up yet more questions about who knew what, when, and why these insights did not lead to changes in other policies in other areas of Home Office work.”"
2020-05-06T19:41:11Z,politics,Politics,Author of Guardian article on death tolls asks UK government to stop using it,"A statistician has asked the government to stop using an article he wrote for the Guardian as justification for why Britain’s death toll from coronavirus should not be compared with that of other countries. Prof David Spiegelhalter said in the piece published on 30 April that comparing the number of deaths from Covid-19 between countries was difficult because of the different methodologies used by governments to measure deaths. His article points out that even though the UK had begun including coronavirus deaths in non-hospital settings, the total toll was still probably too low as it did not include the many deaths of people who had not been tested. Spiegelhalter notes other countries also use different methodologies, such as Spain where deaths in care homes are not included.
The day the article was published, England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, praised it during the No 10 daily coronavirus briefing, saying it showed that comparing death rates in different countries was a “fruitless exercise”. Boris Johnson again referred to Spiegelhalter’s words on Wednesday in a response to the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, during prime minister’s questions, after Britain’s death toll became the highest in Europe and second highest globally. According to latest official figures, at least 30,150 people have died from the virus in the UK.
The prime minister said Starmer “is right to draw attention to the appalling statistics not just in this country and but of course around the world. I would echo what we’ve heard from Prof David Spiegelhalter and others that at this stage, I don’t think that international comparisons and the data is yet there to draw all the conclusions that we want.
“There will be a time to look at what decisions we took and whether we could have taken different decisions.” However, a few hours later Spiegelhalter, tweeted: “Polite request to PM and others: please stop using my Guardian article to claim we cannot make any international comparisons yet. I refer only to detailed league tables-of course we should now use other countries to try and learn why our numbers are high”. Spiegelhalter, who has previously been invited to participate in a meeting of the government’s Sage committee, is the Winton professor of public understanding of risk at Cambridge University."
2020-05-06T19:38:44Z,politics,Politics,Picnics and sunbathing on cards as PM expected to allow more time outside,"Picnics, sunbathing and unlimited rambles will be among the first activities to be allowed when the lockdown loosens, it emerged on Wednesday, after Boris Johnson announced that restrictions would begin to ease from Monday. With the stringent restrictions due to be reviewed on Thursday – and details to be announced on Sunday – the prime minister is expected to change the rules so that people would be able to leave the house repeatedly in a single day, so long as they keep a safe distance from anyone from outside their household. Government Twitter accounts meanwhile began broadcasting a new, more nuanced message on Wednesday – “Stay Safe, Save Lives” – with the stark “Stay Home, Save Lives” slogan set to be ditched.
However, government sources cautioned against expecting an imminent reopening of the economy, with one saying: “We just aren’t in a space of significant changes at all.” The changes – which are likely to leave the public hanging on weather forecasts in the hope of conditions that will make more time out of the house possible – were mooted after Johnson said at prime minister’s questions that the government wanted to “get going with some of these measures on Monday”. But the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said that there could still be localised lockdowns even as restrictions lift nationally, setting out “interventions in smaller, micro-communities where you’re seeing the virus take hold again”.

When the lockdown came into force, some experts were concerned that “fatigue” would set in if restrictions on the public’s daily lives were imposed too soon. But compliance was much higher than the government had anticipated.
Now the Conservative election supremo, Isaac Levido, has been helping to draw up the communications plan for “phase two” of the crisis, as Johnson has called it. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said that allowing people to spend more time outdoors in “small, defined groups” was one of the five “initial options” Scotland is likely to pursue when the scientific evidence justifies lifting some constraints. Scientific evidence suggesting transmission of the virus is less likely in open spaces has led ministers to focus on allowing more outdoor activities. However, pub beer gardens and coffee shops with outdoor seating are likely to remain closed, as are most shops, amid fears that it would be difficult for them to enforce social distancing.
Meanwhile the continued high number of new Covid-19 cases – 6,111 on Tuesday – is likely to deter ministers from more radical steps. Since the lockdown began six weeks ago, the public have been urged only to leave their homes to buy essentials such as food or medicine; to exercise once a day; or to go to work if they cannot do so from home. The restriction on exercise has seen police officers accused of overreach, for moving on lone sunbathers or scolding members of the public for taking a rest on a park bench. The government has been urging local authorities to keep parks open where possible, and confirmed that businesses such as DIY stores and garden centres can operate click-and-collect services, where goods can be picked up while observing social distancing. Significant changes in schools are also expected, with teachers and unions expecting that Johnson will on Sunday confirm the 1 June start date for schools to reopen, beginning with children aged 10 and 11 in year six. Other primary year groups are expected to follow shortly after, and then for years 10 and 12 – the first years for GCSE and A-level courses respectively – to also return to secondary schools.
The decision means that pupils in England could return months before those in Scotland, after Nicola Sturgeon warned that Scottish schools may be shut until the end of the summer holidays. Scotland’s school year ends on 24 June, three weeks before England. Questions remain about how schools in England will be expected to source personal protective equipment, especially for staff in reception classes where children as young as four require close attention. In a joint letter to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, the National Education Union and Parentkind – formerly the Parent-Teachers’ Association UK – warned “there is a risk of chaos and a greater spread of the virus” unless parents and staff were reassured about the safety of reopening. Other measures still under consideration include the creation of social “bubbles”, allowing households to mix with a limited number of others. Downing Street has not ruled out this option – though some ministers are sceptical about how it could be enforced in practice. One Whitehall source warned that if people failed to stick to the rules carefully, it could lead to “a catastrophic epidemiological demonstration of the rule of six degrees of separation”. Ministers are also keen to get more people back to work where it is impractical for them to work from home, though draft guidelines for safe working have prompted a furious backlash from unions this week. None of the changes announced on Sunday are likely to affect those with underlying health conditions, who have been asked to “shield” themselves from the virus by continuing to remain permanently at home. The relatively modest shift is likely to infuriate Conservative MPs who have criticised the impingement on the public’s liberties and the economic costs of the lockdown. Chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee, Graham Brady, has called for the lifting of “arbitrary rules and limitations on freedom as quickly as possible” and suggested the public had been “a little too willing to stay at home”."
2020-05-06T19:05:03Z,politics,Politics,Chancellor tells unions there will be no cliff-edge end to furlough,"The chancellor Rishi Sunak has held talks with nine of Britain’s union leaders to try to reassure them plans to phase out the government’s furlough scheme will be gradual and minimise the impact on unemployment. In the run-up to an announcement next week about the future of the wage subsidy scheme, Sunak sought to dampen union concerns that the coronavirus support package would be brought to an abrupt halt at the end of June. It comes as concerns grow in Westminster over the rising costs of the programme, with a cost to the public purse of between £3bn and 4bn a week. There are fears it could match the level of spending on the NHS. Sunak told union leaders – including the TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady, the Unite general secretary Len McCluskey and the Unison general secretary Dave Prentis – that he was concerned the scheme was being abused by some companies, either because they did not need to furlough staff or because they were planning to go out of business when the subsidies came to an end.
But he insisted that there would be no cliff edge to the furlough scheme and has been irked by stories – emanating from elsewhere in Whitehall – suggesting that workers were becoming “addicted” to wage top-ups worth up to 80% of monthly earnings up to a maximum of £2,500. Unions have supported the furlough scheme since it was introduced just days after Britain went into lockdown in late March, seeing it as a way of preventing millions more workers being made unemployed. Sunak has also publicly thanked union bosses and business leaders for help in designing the job-retention scheme. Treasury officials are weighing up a range of options for the programme, which expanded quickly to cover more than 6 million workers within two weeks of being opened. During the virtual meeting, unions expressed anxiety about the furlough scheme being abused by employers planning to make redundancies anyway, and said there was a need for workers to be properly protected when they return to work as the economy comes out of lockdown. Discussions were also held about how the scheme could be made more flexible as the government begins the task of reopening the British economy after more than a month of tight controls on business and social life. A spokesman for the TUC said the unions had a constructive meeting with Sunak, discussing the job retention scheme and raising concerns about the government’s back-to-work guidelines.
“We repeated our call for employers to publish risk assessments to give workers the confidence they will be safe. And we pressed for ministers to beef up enforcement to ensure companies who flout the law face sanctions. “It is crucial government continues to consult with unions in the days ahead.” With the furlough scheme costing an estimated £14bn a month, the chancellor is keen to get the economy moving as soon as the health experts say it is safe to do so. Sunak made it clear he wanted to work with the unions so that when the government’s five tests are met the public feel safe to return to work and the virus can be controlled effectively. Sources said he expressed concern on the call over the rising costs of the job retention scheme and that he wanted to keep working closely with unions and business leaders to shape the economic response to the coronavirus. The meeting was held to open fresh lines of communication between No 11 and unions as the government begins to lift lockdown restrictions. Relations during the Covid-19 outbreak have typically been through the TUC, although there was a desire to bring individual unions into direct dialogue to ease the reopening of the economy, including by involving those representing workers in some of the most heavily affected sectors, such as postal and retail employees. Alongside tailoring the job-retention scheme to fit with government plans to reopen the economy, Sunak is expected to update employers next week before a crucial deadline.
Employers seeking to make more than 100 redundancies must run a 45-day consultation, meaning 18 May is the last point they could start this process before the furlough scheme closes at the end of June. Among options believed to be under consideration for scaling back the support is allowing firms to cut workers hours to 15 a week with the taxpayer paying for the rest. Wage subsidies could be cut from 80% to 60% as an alternative, or subsidies could be kept for sectors where restrictions could be kept in place longer, such as for pubs and restaurants. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said it was vital to introduce a greater degree of flexibility to the scheme to support a phased return to work. Warning that switching off the scheme at the end of June would risk a flood of job losses, she said: “I will continue to try to work with government to facilitate this, and ensure that jobs and incomes are protected.”"
2020-05-06T18:53:48Z,politics,Politics,Parts of UK economy 'on life support' since lockdown,"More than a month into coronavirus lockdown measures large parts of the British economy are now on life support. Nearly one in four UK workers have been furloughed in the past fortnight, with their wages subsidised by the state in an attempt to stop the unfolding economic crisis – already expected to be the deepest recession since 1709 – from getting even worse. So far the government’s coronavirus job retention scheme (CJRS) has protected 6.3m jobs at some 800,000 firms, with a price tag for the exchequer amounting to more than £8bn by 3 May. According to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, as many as 4m redundancies have been avoided, but the workforce specialists have warned its “all or nothing” format must be reviewed to help furloughed staff back into work. As the cost of running the furlough scheme spirals with much of the jobs market now being propped up by the state, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is weighing up his options over how best to wean Britain off emergency financial aid as lockdown controls are lifted. Under the current plan, workers who are furloughed have 80% of their wages paid by the government up to a ceiling of £2,500 per month. At present, the CJRS wage subsidies are to remain in place until the end of June, although the chancellor is under mounting pressure to tell employers what he plans to do next. Providing firms with information before the end of next week about whether the scheme will carry on is crucial. This deadline exists because if there is no further support coming then firms may plan redundnancies and, if they are going to cut more than 100 jobs they must first run a 45-day consultation. As the scheme will close at the end of June without action, the deadline for that consultation to be launched is 18 May. Sunak’s goal at the outset was to use the scheme to keep as many people as possible in their existing jobs. The theory was that there might be a V-shaped downturn and bounce back and the jobs subsidy would ensure workers would still be in place when the economy reopened. However, the costs have risen beyond the Treasury’s initial expectations as the number of workers on the scheme has mushroomed. The bounce back is no longer expected to be swift, especially in businesses such as hospitality, leading a senior government source to warn the Times that Britain had grown “addicted” to the furlough scheme. In danger of costing the taxpayer as much as the NHS to run, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates the CJRS could now cost £42bn over three months if 8.3 million people are furloughed. If continually run at these levels, the Resolution Foundation predicts it would cost an additional £12bn per month. Many within the Treasury regard the cost of inaction as far greater, with the priority to protect millions of jobs. In addition to harming personal lives and finances, stopping the scheme too soon could lead to a growing benefit bill, a weaker economy and greatly reduced tax revenue in future. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said ministers needed to urgently adapt the scheme to align it with a phased restart of the economy. “Support must remain in place for firms that are not able to operate for an extended period and for those who face reduced capacity or demand for their services as a result of ongoing restrictions,” he added. The options the chancellor has included: Cliff edge Business leaders warn the planned sudden end of the scheme in June could be a “cliff edge” that would trigger a huge number of redundancies without action. Sunak has promised to remove such a risk. There have been calls to extend the scheme until at least the autumn to help firms gradually restart their activities. According to a survey of more than 1,000 businesses by the CIPD, as many as 60% said that was the most important change Sunak could make. Ben Willmott, head of public policy at the CIPD, said: “Even if the government extended for another month it would give them more breathing time to develop a scheme that is more flexible and provides employers with a timeline for weaning themselves off furlough and bringing people back to work.” The problem is the cost: about £4bn a week. Sector approach The government could take a gradual approach to restarting the economy by allowing some businesses to reopen before others. Those where there are higher risks of spreading infection, such as pubs and restaurants, could reopen last, and therefore need continuing taxpayer-funded wage support longest. Willmott said the government could maintain an 80% wage subsidy for hospitality firms, but cut it to 50%, or steadily roll back its support for other firms. “Some sectors are being hit harder by the impact of the virus and demand in those parts of the economy will be slower to pick up,” he added. There could however be challenges, as some activities do not fit neatly into a particular sector. In one example, some retailers have been able to stay open, while others have been forced to close. Cutting the subsidy The Treasury could reduce the level of the subsidy from 80% over time, although this could impose hardship for people if their companies did not top up their wages. It is understood that the Treasury is considering reducing the subsidy to 60%. Kate Bell, head of rights at the TUC, said subsidies would still be required for people who cannot go to work once lockdown has been lifted, such as people who still need to shield themselves for health reasons, or who would struggle to get their children to school. She said another option would be to ask businesses to set out jobs and wages plans on how theyare using the scheme to prevent redundancies, should they wish to continue receiving support. “Companies need to make a profit, but they need their workers to do that. Most people want a return to work, but you could see that some conditionality makes the scheme easier to operate,” she added. Flexible working on furlough The government could allow some part-time working under the furlough scheme, topping up workers’ salary payments. This could be used to ease businesses back to normal. Such a system could, however, be open to abuse. Some firms have forced staff to keep working while claiming public money to furlough them. The current breadth of the scheme, with limited flexibility on working time, was designed to reduce this risk, meaning tweaks and alterations could pave the way for further abuse. Back to the 1970s When Sunak first announced the scheme in March, he said it was for the “first time in our history” that the government was stepping in to help pay workers’ wages. He was wrong. During the turbulent economic troubles of the late 1970s, a temporary employment subsidy was available to support employers. Where at least 10 redundancies were threatened, the TES programme offered a subsidy of £20 a week for up to 12 months for each job saved. Started in the late 1970s as the country grappled with recession and 1.5 million unemployed, it was gradually made less generous until it was removed in 1984, the same year unemployment hit a postwar peak. A new TES could replace the job retention scheme. What are other countries doing? In the US one-off payments to individuals worth $1,200 from the government have been used to soften the blow from soaring unemployment. Some 30 million Americans have signed on as unemployed in six weeks. Wage subsidy schemes have been used to protect jobs across Europe, and other countries are facing problems too. France has a partial activity scheme, whereby firms can be compensated for 70% of a worker’s salary up to €6,927 per month. The government is working on how to adapt the scheme from the start of next month to help the maximum number of people back to work. Ministers in Ireland are also looking at ways to extend a wage subsidy scheme due to expire in June."
2020-05-06T18:30:31Z,politics,Politics,Have the government's five tests for easing lockdown been met?,"The government has said it can only consider easing the lockdown once the country has passed five tests. To do so beforehand would risk a deadly second wave of coronavirus – one that could overwhelm the NHS. On Thursday the government is expected to formally extend the powers needed to continue the lockdown, but on Sunday the prime minister is likely to set out how the country might lift the strict measures that have paralysed the economy. What the government does and when will depend on safety considerations. Here we consider whether the government’s five tests have been met. Test one: making sure the NHS can cope and continues to have sufficient capacity It is increasingly clear that the much-feared surge that had threatened to overwhelm the health service has been overcome. As far back as mid-April, NHS Providers was confident enough to say hospitals should be able to cope with a peak. Now cancelled operations are being restarted, as less than a third of critical care beds are occupied by people with Covid-19. In London, one of the first Nightingale hospitals set up to help meet demand is to be placed on standby and will no longer admit patients. Verdict: met. Test two: a ‘sustained and consistent’ fall in daily deaths Coronavirus deaths in hospitals have been falling and a peak has now been passed. However, as the government’s deputy chief scientific adviser, Angela McLean, acknowledged on Tuesday, the UK is yet to “get to grips” with the number of deaths in care homes. The UK now has Europe’s worst coronavirus death toll, having reached 29,427 on Tuesday, exceeding Italy’s 29,029, which does not include suspected cases. McLean said the daily number of deaths had been falling steadily since the middle of April, though those in care homes were still rising in the week to 24 April. Verdict: being met. Test three: solid data showing the rate of infection is decreasing to ‘manageable’ levels An indicator that will be closely watched in the coming days, the UK’s infection rate stopped rising on 21 April. However, England’s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said on Monday that new cases of Covid-19 across the UK needed to come down further. Figures released on Wednesday showed 6,111 cases had been recorded since Tuesday, up 1,700 on the day before. Yvonne Doyle, the director of health protection for Public Health England, said the figures “may be a matter of concern”. Doyle’s suggestion that testing could account for some of the increase in cases was greeted with scepticism, given testing appears to have gone down. The success of the contact-tracing app developed by the NHS, which is being trialled on the Isle of Wight from this week, will be a crucial element in meeting the test. The chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told MPs on Tuesday that the infection rate (R number) needed to be below one before lockdown measures could begin to be lifted. He said the current estimate of the value of R was between 0.6 and 0.9. There are ongoing worries about increased transport usage, supported by government data. Verdict: not met. Test four: ensuring that supply of tests and personal protective equipment (PPE) can meet future demand An area where the government continues to face sustained criticism from the opposition and representative bodies for health and social care workers. On PPE, the pressure has lifted somewhat since 17 April, when hospitals came within hours of running out of supplies, but Boris Johnson conceded in parliament on Wednesday that there were continuing challenges. Operators of care homes complain that they are still struggling to source sufficient equipment and that staff are having trouble accessing testing. Testing remains an issue more broadly. While a programme for key workers has been ramped up, there are complaints that some testing centres are too far away from where they are needed and accessible only by car, while problems have arisen around delivery of home testing kits.
As highlighted by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, the UK has fallen back below the 100,000 daily tests target reached at the end of last week, with only 69,463 carried out on Tuesday. The government also faces awkward questions about why it abandoned community testing early in March. Verdict: not met. Test five: avoiding a second peak that would risk overwhelming the NHS In the absence of a vaccine, which is not expected to be available until next year, this is potentially the most difficult test to overcome. At a basic level, the transformation of the NHS and creation of Nightingale hospitals at least give some degree of confidence that there are the beds and resources to avoid the health service being overwhelmed. But among other factors, meeting this test relies on the widespread and effective creation of a contact-tracing system. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has described this as a “huge national undertaking of unprecedented scale and complexity”, involving the rollout of the new NHS app and the recruitment of an army of contact tracers. He previously said 18,000 tracers might be needed, but on Monday he indicated that this figure would be adjusted if a survey showed the virus was more prevalent than previously thought. A raft of questions persist, not least about whether the public will use the app in sufficient numbers. Verdict: not met."
2020-05-06T18:10:21Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: official death toll rises to 30,076 as 649 more people die â€“ as it happened","Boris Johnson will present his plan to begin easing lockdown measures on Sunday, with aspects to come into effect on Monday. The cabinet and Cobra will meet over the weekend to agree a plan before the prime minister makes the announcement; he will make a statement to the Commons on Monday. Also today, Nicola Sturgeon told Holyrood her government would start to lift restrictions â€œas soon as possibleâ€�, after the latest data showed coronavirus-related deaths in Scotland fell for the first time, and the Welsh government said it expected a â€œcareful and cautious approachâ€� to relaxing the lockdown from Westminster. Rishi Sunak is preparing to wind down the job retention scheme from July as the government plans to gradually remove lockdown measures. A decision is yet to be made, but the Treasury is understood to be examining several options for tapering the scheme, including cutting the 80% wage subsidy to 60% and lowering the Â£2,500 cap on monthly payments. Another option promoted by employersâ€™ groups to allow furloughed staff to work, but with a smaller state subsidy, is also under consideration. The official UK coronavirus death toll passed 30,000 as another 649 fatalities were recorded. The new total of 30,076 represents the number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 and died, so the true number will be much higher. Heathrow airport is to begin temperature screening of passengers in an effort to minimise transmission across borders. The airportâ€™s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said it would trial technologies and processes that could form the basis of a common international standard for health screening at airports, including cameras in immigration halls. No 10 scaled down the scope of the PMâ€™s new â€œ200,000 tests per dayâ€� target as the government missed its 100,000 daily tests goal for a fourth day running. The PMâ€™s spokesman said that when Johnson set the new testing target for the end of May during PMQs, he had been referring to testing capacity. Later, Robert Jenrick told the daily press briefing that 69,463 tests were carried out yesterday. Rising levels of racism towards people of east Asian heritage have left many feeling too scared to venture out when the lockdown is eventually lifted, research suggests. The survey by Prof Binna Kandola found that just over half of respondents had experienced an increase in discrimination since the pandemic began, with Chinese people reporting being coughed at, attacked, mocked and abused. Kandola said society had an opportunity to show zero tolerance towards racist behaviour once the lockdown is eased. The tube will only be able to run at 20% capacity to allow for physical distancing, Sadiq Khan said. The mayor of London said the transport system could not operate at pre-crisis levels while maintaining physical distancing at all times, so capacity would have to be reduced to 13-20% and the carrying capacity of double-decker buses could be reduced from 85 to 15 passengers. He argued that everyone in London who could work from home would have to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. And police decided not to take action against Prof Neil Ferguson after he breached lockdown rules. The scientist resigned last night after it emerged that he had broken lockdown restrictions by receiving visits from his lover. This morning the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said it was right that he had stepped down and backed any action the police decided to take. However, Scotland Yard said that since Ferguson had accepted responsibility for his error of judgment, no further action would be taken. Downing Street confirmed Ferguson would no longer be advising the government in any way. Thatâ€™s it from us on the UK side for today. Thank you to everybody who got in touch and to all of you for reading along.

2020-05-06T16:30:22Z,politics,Politics,Bombastic Boris meets his match in forensic Starmer at PMQs | John Crace,"For possibly the first time in his life, Boris Johnson had appeared interested in changing a nappy. “I’m sure it must be my turn now,” he had said hopefully. Carrie Symonds had merely looked confused. In desperation, Boris had next tried to ring Dominic Raab, but the phone went straight to voicemail. The foreign secretary wasn’t that stupid: there was no way he was going to risk a hat-trick of humiliations. Dominic Cummings had then gently taken the prime minister by the arm and led him to the Downing Street front door. It was time. The point of no return. So it was a decidedly reluctant and somewhat sheepish Boris that appeared for his first prime minister’s questions up against Keir Starmer in the Commons. He had the air of a naughty schoolboy about to appear in front of the headteacher for repeatedly failing to hand in his homework and expecting a prolonged detention as punishment. If only Boris had managed to get off that lightly. By the end he had only made the situation worse by making countless promises he had no idea he would be able to keep and which would be certain to be added to later charge sheets. For all his life Boris has managed to blag his way out of any tricky situation. Half Flashman, half Billy Bunter, lies and half-truths have been his stock in trade. But in Starmer it is as if he has instinctively realised he has met his match. A power greater than himself. There was little of the prime minister’s familiar smirks, bluster and banter. Weirdly, he didn’t even really make much effort to put up a fight. Just a series of mumbled excuses that he didn’t expect to be believed.
Not that it’s any great shock Starmer has turned out to be so good at PMQs. First off, he’s an inherently serious man and these are serious times. He’s also had years of practice in cross-examination as a QC, so he’s learned how to fine tune his approach. He asks the right questions in the right manner. Never raising his voice, the stiletto in his hand is his courtesy. A death by a thousand kindnesses. What was more surprising was just how easy it all was for him. Keir will have had a harder morning’s work defending a shoplifter at Snaresbrook crown court. It turns out that the simplest way to compromise Boris is merely by using his own words against him as evidence. Starmer started with a gentle warm-up. Two weeks ago, the prime minister had boasted of our apparent success in dealing with the coronavirus. What part of a death rate of more than 30,000 – the highest in Europe – did he consider a success? Johnson barely even attempted an answer, muttering that he hoped one day the international data might produce the conclusions he wanted. Besides, now was not the time for any kind of public inquiry. Or ever, if possible. From there on it all went steadily downhill for Boris as Starmer observed it was the government’s own data that highlighted the UK’s unwanted top spot in European coronavirus deaths. Wasn’t it the fact that we had been too slow to lock down, to test, to trace and to provide personal protective equipment? Why had it taken 12 weeks to recognise the danger in care homes? When were we going to see a proper strategy as opposed to a few barely literate slogans? Boris visibly wilted under the most gentle of onslaughts. Maybe he’s still not fully recovered from his illness. Maybe his time in intensive care has provided him with a conscience that had hitherto been absent. Or maybe he somehow realises the game is up. That he was essentially a prime minister for the Good Times, someone to lift spirits with delusional appeals to jingoism. All of which could take place in a moral vacuum of no consequences for him. Now, though, he knows he’s been found out. That his failures have left him with blood on his hands that no amount of washing for 20 seconds while singing Happy Birthday can get clean. He has become Lady Macbeth. Whatever the truth, Boris could not prevent himself from sleepwalking into further incriminating himself. It was an outrage, he said, that NHS staff did not have adequate PPE. As if the situation was in no way his responsibility. Bluster had given way to dissociation. In his head he is both the prime minister and not the prime minister. Schrödinger’s PM. Thereafter, his logic collapsed in on itself. Having promised 250,000 tests back in March, he now promised to double the health secretary’s still largely fictitious figure of 100,000 to 200,000 by the end of the month. Matt Hancock shook his head in disbelief at this. This was clearly the first he had heard of this. Here was yet another ad hoc commitment on which he would be hung out to dry. Boris concluded by saying he was sorry not to be able to announce what measures he may or may not be introducing to ease the lockdown to parliament this week. Mainly because he still hadn’t a clue what they might be. Kill the economy or kill the nation? Maybe he would have more data by the time he spoke to the nation on Sunday. Or maybe he wouldn’t. But he did promise someone from the government would make a statement to parliament some time next week. Though it probably wouldn’t be him as he had things to do, such as choosing a new colour scheme for the nursery, and he didn’t know if he could stand another punishment caress from Starmer so soon. Hancock again looked ashen faced. For the second time in as many minutes, he was being lined up as the patsy. Some guys get all the luck."
2020-05-06T16:00:09Z,politics,Politics,Home Office accused of pressuring judiciary over immigration decisions,"The Home Office has been accused of interfering with the independence of the judiciary after it emerged that judges were asked to provide written explanations for a rise in the number of detainees released from immigration centres during the Covid-19 pandemic. In a letter to the president of the Tribunal, Immigration and Asylum Chamber dated 29 April 2020, the Home Office’s head of appeals, James Stevens, wrote: “The numbers of those in detention have reduced very significantly since the start of this emergency.” He went on to say: “The Home Office is somewhat surprised at the level of grants of bail in recent weeks.” Official figures record 1,225 people in detention centres on 1 January and 368 at the latest count – a reduction of almost three-quarters. Stevens outlined the ways in which the Home Office had responded to the risks coronavirus posed to detainees, before adding: “Where bail is granted I would ask you to consider whether immigration judges could provide written reasons for this.” Judges are not required by law to do this. Stevens wrote: “While I realise this is not a requirement under the procedure rules, it would assist the Home Office to fully understand the reasons why bail has been granted.” The Home Office is supposed to detain only those it can deport imminently, and its ability to do this has been drastically reduced due to flights being grounded. There have been three confirmed cases of Covid-19 among immigration detainees, and the risk of catching the virus remains high among those who are locked up for extended periods.﻿ In a response dated 1 May, Michael Clements, the chamber’s president, issued a robust rejection of the Home Office’s request. “As independent judiciary we decide bail applications in accordance with the law, which includes the guidance which has been issued. There has been no change in either the law or the guidance,” he wrote. “The primary function of detention is accordingly to facilitate removal, and unless there are very powerful reasons to the contrary bail should be granted if there is no removal of the bail applicant within the reasonably foreseeable future.” He said that during the pandemic he had instituted a “minded to grant” bail process, giving the Home Office an early indication before a bail hearing took place that a judge was likely to grant bail unless the Home Office could provide specific reasons why this should not happen. “Unfortunately, the feedback that I am receiving is not only that the Home Office rarely consent to the grant of bail having seen the ‘minded to grant’ but that bail is still opposed at the hearing without any meaningful additional representations being given.” Pierre Makhlouf, an assistant director at Bail for Immigration Detainees, accused the Home Office of interfering with the judicial approach to bail applications because the rate of successful bail applications had shot up from its usual level of about 30%. He said 55 out of 58 cases where the charity provided representation since lockdown began had been granted bail. Adrian Berry, the chair of the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, said: “It is not appropriate for government to use its position outside of the courtroom to seek to influence decisions. The separation of powers between the government and judiciary is a core constitutional principle.” Bella Sankey, the director of Detention Action, which launched a legal challenge calling for the mass release of detainees during the pandemic, said: “This letter is a constitutional disgrace, entirely in keeping with a government that thinks it is above the law and not answerable to our sovereign parliament. “That the Home Office has sought to pressure the immigration tribunal over its bail decisions during a global pandemic shows alarming disrespect for the right to liberty, the rule of law and the separation of powers.” Toufique Hossain, of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who brought the Detention Action case, said: “Separation of powers is a basic principle of any democratic society to safeguard liberties and guard against tyranny.” ﻿A Home Office spokesperson said: “This is completely untrue, and the Guardian knows full well that this letter is explaining transparently to the judiciary how we are responding to this pandemic, including carefully reviewing the cases of those in detention. The public expects law and order to be maintained, which is why 95% of those currently in detention are foreign-national offenders.”﻿"
2020-05-06T13:29:44Z,politics,Politics,Eight-year-old boy takes Home Office to court for denying family benefits,"An eight-year-old British boy is taking the Home Office to the high court over its policy of denying families like his access to the welfare safety net. The boy, who cannot be named, is arguing that the Home Office’s no recourse to public funds (NRPF) policy is unlawful and that during the Covid-19 pandemic the policy increases the risk of families becoming destitute as well as heightening public health risks as people are forced into overcrowded accommodation or onto the streets. The NRPF policy was introduced in 2012 as part of the government’s so-called “hostile environment”. It affects different groups of migrants, some of whom have leave to remain and some who do not. The policy can prevent both groups from accessing benefits and other forms of social support.
The boy’s mother arrived in the UK in 2009 and was granted leave to remain. She works as a low-paid carer for mentally disabled people and, as a single parent, struggles to support herself and her son. The boy, who was born in the UK, has been forced to move schools five times due to the precarity of his mother’s situation. Caz Hattam, the coordinator of the Unity Project, said: “The pandemic has made the situation for families like this one more urgent and desperate. The destitution of these families directly impacts on their ability to take public health precautions, increasing their exposure to the virus and their potential to spread it.” The legal challenge comes on the same day the Children’s Society released a report highlighting the plight of these families and calling for a suspension of NRPF conditions during the pandemic. The report points out that many parents in this situation are on zero-hours contracts and some have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic but cannot access benefits such as universal credit or child benefit. Haringey Migrant Support Centre has also compiled a report documenting concerns about the failures to protect migrant rough sleepers with no recourse to public funds during the pandemic. The report warns: “Failure to protect the most vulnerable is a failure to protect us all.” It states that too many migrants are still sleeping rough despite a government promise to “bring everyone in”, and that London boroughs have adopted an inconsistent approach to this call from government, which is not underpinned by statutory instrument. A government spokesperson said: “It is only right that those seeking to establish their family life in the UK do so on a basis that prevents burden on the taxpayer. People granted leave under the family and human rights routes can apply to have conditions lifted so they can access public funds, and in this particular case conditions have been lifted since 2019.”"
2020-05-06T12:26:37Z,politics,Politics,PMQs verdict: floundering Johnson meets calm and focused Starmer,"Key points Starmer said last week the PM talked about the “apparent success” of the government’s approach. But death numbers are the highest in Europe, and the second highest in the world. He said this is not a success and asked him how it came to that? Johnson quoted a piece by Prof David Spiegelhalter in the Guardian about comparing death rates and added that there will be a time to look at what went wrong. Starmer said why has it taken so long to improve the situation in care homes. Johnson responded that there had been a “palpable improvement”. Starmer said testing numbers have fallen back since last week, when the government hit its 100,000 a day target. What was so special about that day? Johnson said Starmer was right to pay tribute to the work done on this last week and added the ambition was now to ramp up testing to 200,000 a day. Starmer replied that having a target wasn’t a strategy. Testing, tracing and isolating is key – but this was abandoned. Why was contact tracing abandoned in mid-March and not restarted sooner? Johnson said in mid-March capacity did not meet demand but now there is a team that will be able to track and trace hundreds of thousands of people across the country. Starmer turned to PPE, saying 40% of docs had to buy it themselves or rely on donations. This will get worse when people return to work. Johnson said the shortages have been “enraging” but added supply will be ramped up now and there had been no “stock outs”. Starmer said people will need reassurance it will be safe to return to work and send their children to school. Will Johnson answer MPs’ questions about his plan on Monday. Johnson said there will be a statement on Monday. But he is doing his announcement on Sunday because he wants some of these measures to start on Monday. Snap verdict In a pre-Covid PMQs a Tory prime minister who was riding high in the opinion polls and who was returning to the House of Commons after an illness that left him in intensive care would have been welcomed by such a wall of noise that it would have been hard for any opposition leader to make much of a mark. But, of course, there is no chance of PMQs resuming its shouting match status any time soon (one of the few benefits of this ghastly crisis) and instead Boris Johnson was left looking exposed and diminished as he faced Keir Starmer for the first time. As had been widely expected, Starmer was impressive - focused, calm, and rational. His interventions today were crisper than in his previous two outings (probably an improvement), and he always ended with a very direct question, simple yet incriminating. No doubt he could manage in a rowdy Commons, but the court room silence seems to suit him better, and the overall impression left by the encounter was of a rather floundering prime minister struggling to respond to a grown-up channelling the questions a critical nation wants answered. Another difficulty for the PM in Zoom PMQs is that he can’t pick the brains of the specialist minister sitting alongside him. Prime ministers are normally more reliant on prompts from colleagues at PMQs than people realise, and Johnson looked particular in need of verbal assistance from Matt Hancock when asked about PPE. In normal PMQs, a struggling PM would resort to sloganising, and hope the backbench noise machine might do the rest, but with that no longer an option it did seem as if Johnson was more reliant on making points of substance. He could not answer Starmer’s questions easily (they were designed to be hard to answer - at least, hard to answer without admitting gross negligence), but he did show some leg on a public inquiry, and provided a relatively revealing answer about why he is making the lockdown announcement on Sunday. Starmer will be pleased with how the exchanges went. But if the new format militates against sloganising, then that is potentially a problem for the leader of the opposition too. At his first PMQs against Tony Blair, David Cameron came out with the memorable line about how Blair “was the future once” - a soundbite and a slogan, but a good one, that defined Cameron successfully. A week today, we will remember that Starmer looked the part at his first PMQs, but we are less likely to remember what he actually said."

2020-05-06T10:58:19Z,politics,Politics,Rory Stewart pulls out of contest to be next London mayor,"Rory Stewart has withdrawn his independent bid for the London mayoralty after the contest was extended by a year because of coronavirus. Stewart, a former Conservative cabinet minister, said he could not ask his volunteer campaigners to keep going for another 12 months as he sought to challenge Labour’s Sadiq Khan for the top job in the capital. He had launched his campaign after failing in an attempt to be Tory leader and then losing the party whip over Brexit. He resigned as an MP before the last election. Speaking to the Evening Standard, Stewart said he could not compete with the Labour and Tory machines, which have bigger budgets for another year. “The point about an independent campaign is it needs to be a sort of quite quick insurgency where you really build excitement over a few months,” he said. “But you can’t beat these huge machines if you’re pushed into a nearly two-year campaign.” Stewart had been in third place, according to the polls, behind Khan and the Tory candidate, Shaun Bailey. Khan is strongly expected to win a second term. The capital had been due to go to the polls on Thursday. Local council elections have also been postponed. Stewart said: “We were on our way to a great battle this time round, I thought. One of the team just said: ‘It’s like one of those drag races – we built our car but we never really got to race it properly.’ “It’s been a very difficult decision. It’s a job I really, really dreamed of. I don’t think I will ever find another role in the world which would be as exciting or satisfying as that. It would have been a great, great privilege. There is no city like it in the world. “If I had been lucky enough to be elected, I would much rather have done [this] than being prime minister.” He told the Standard he wanted to stay in public life and maybe write a book about politics, but he would not rejoin the Tories. He said: “I would like to stay in some form of public service … so maybe some charities or universities and see if there will be another opportunity in the future to contribute in some way. It just didn’t seem fair or realistic to [continue].” Stewart was one of the first to sound the alarm about government slowness to order a lockdown over the coronavirus crisis, urging the prime minister to shut schools and cancel major events in early March. At that time the government and its scientists were saying it was not necessary and former Tory colleagues accused him of “sensationalising” the crisis for political ends."

ONS figures and calculations by Reuters revealed that 32,313 deaths were registered with Covid-19 on the death certificate. However, as the official tally reached 29,427, the government rejected international comparisons due to all-cause excess mortality as well as differences in how individual countries collect and measure their data. Dominic Raab told the daily press briefing: I donâ€™t think you can make the international comparisons youâ€™re suggesting at this stage, at least I donâ€™t think you can make them reliably. The UKâ€™s testing capacity should have been expanded sooner, Sir Patrick Vallance told the health committee. However he said Dr Jenny Harries had been right to say testing on its own does not provide the solution. He said: In the early phases, if we had managed to ramp testing capacity quicker, it would have been beneficial. For all sorts of reasons that did not happen. And I think itâ€™s clear you need lots of testing for this. Reopening all schools at once would create a â€œvery real riskâ€� of an increase in the infection rate and of a second peak, the government said. Raab said the evidence to date suggested the five tests and risk of a second spike were crucial to deciding how and when to reopen schools, and Sage is considering different options for how to do this safely. This came on the same day the Scottish government published a paper outlining that it would not be safe for schools to reopen fully in the foreseeable future. An extract said: Full reopening [of schools] would cause a resurgence in the virus such that hospital capacity in Scotland would be overwhelmed in less than two months ... We are considering a phased approach to returning pupils to school, when it is safe to do so. We do not consider it likely that schools will reopen fully in the foreseeable future. Indeed, we are not yet certain that they can re-open at all in the near future. Virgin Atlantic announced plans to cut 3,150 jobs and end its operation of Gatwick. The airline said uncertainty over when flying will resume as well as â€œunprecedented market conditionsâ€� as a result of the pandemic had â€œseverely reduced revenuesâ€�, leaving it to reduce its workforce by more than a third. Thatâ€™s it from us for today on the UK side. Thank you to everyone who got in touch with a story and to all of you for reading along.

2020-05-05T16:04:41Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock's career continues to win the battle with his conscience | John Crace,"Normally Matt Hancock is relentlessly upbeat. The very model of middle-management enthusiasm. The Tigger who gives good meeting and likes to say yes. But over the past week or so, a few cracks have begun to appear in his natural charm and the health secretary has been decidedly tetchy. It’s as if he feels under-appreciated. Not just by a country that he feels he has been working round the clock – no one has done more media appearances than him – to single-handedly save from the coronavirus pandemic, and which only wants to know why the UK now has the highest number of deaths in Europe, but by his cabinet colleagues who are, at best, doing nothing and frequently making things actively worse. If he never saw Priti Patel or Michael Gove again it wouldn’t be a moment too soon. Here he actually has the nation’s sympathy. If that wasn’t bad enough, on the very morning before he was due to face both departmental questions and an urgent question in the Commons, he’d rather been landed in the shit by both the chief and deputy scientific advisers giving evidence at the select committee. Patrick Vallance had said that if it was down to him then all the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies’ evidence would have been published – something the government needed like a hole in the head – while Jenny Harries had all but admitted that the reason the UK had not made testing a priority early on was because we did not have the capacity to do so. So Matt was already on a decidedly short fuse as he took his place on the government front bench. He made it through questions from the shadow health secretary, John Ashworth, by interpreting them as unequivocal support for his new “test, track and trace” app that was being piloted on the Isle of Wight, but lost it when challenged by Labour’s junior health minister, Rosena Allin-Khan, who in her spare time as an MP doubles up as an A&E doctor in a south London hospital and has far more experience of how the NHS works in practice than Hancock. Not that Allin-Khan’s questions were particularly aggressive or demanding. Rather, they were completely to the point. The testing strategy had been non-existent early on and the figures had been manipulated to allow the health secretary to claim that his arbitrary target of 100,000 daily tests had been reached by the end of April. All of which had contributed to an unnecessarily high mortality rate and had meant that doctors like her had been left to break the bad news that people had died to relatives. This was too much for Tigger. Almost as if a nerve had been touched. “Methought I heard a voice cry. Sleep no more! Mattbeth doth murder sleep.” For deep down Hancock does care: he knows that the government’s response to the pandemic in the early days was hopelessly inadequate and that many lives could have possibly been saved. Yet he dare not say so for fear of implicating both himself and colleagues. In the battle between his career and his conscience, the career is still winning. But the gap is closing. Part of him longs to tell the truth. About the uselessness of his predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, who ran down the capacity of the NHS to unsafe levels. About the self-indulgence of a prime minister who prioritised celebrating Brexit and sorting out his private life over trying to make sure the country was prepared for the pandemic. Yet he can’t quite go there yet. So instead he attacked Allin-Khan for adopting the wrong tone. In time, he will see that it was he who got the tone wrong. During a brief interlude while Hancock left the chamber, his junior minister, the nice-but-dim Edward Argar, claimed the reason the UK had failed to join the EU procurement scheme four times was because the email had gone to the wrong address four times, but that if an invitation went to the right address next time he would be all ears. He then compounded the embarrassment by insisting Exercise Cygnus had been a total success in preparing the country for the pandemic, because it had turned out we had enough ventilators all along despite his department having tried to panic-buy 30,000 in March. It’s come to something when a minister can’t come up with any better excuses than this. Even when he returned for the UQ, Hancock didn’t seem entirely himself. He just couldn’t understand why everyone was so focused on what was going wrong. The lack of personal protective equipment, the high mortality rate, the reluctance of the government to announce any relaxation of lockdown to parliament rather than at a bank holiday press conference. Why couldn’t people congratulate him on reaching his 100k testing target? One day he will realise he’d have got more applause for narrowly failing to meet an ambitious target, than fiddling the figures? There again, Matt isn’t the fastest of learners. So maybe not. There were times when you could sense Hancock was itching to dob his colleagues in. Jeremy Hunt for ignoring Exercise Cygnus. Priti Vacant for failing to test and isolate passengers at airports. But he held it together. Just. Though for how much longer is anyone’s guess. Right now he’s propping up the entire government and taking the flak for everyone else’s failures. Sooner or later, something will have to give. And when Matt does erupt, it could be a thing of beauty. It could also be the making of him. The Little Man’s revenge."
2020-05-05T13:36:26Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit talks hurtling towards new crisis point, says Irish foreign minister","Brexit talks are hurtling to another crisis point unless progress is made in the next two rounds of talks, the Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, has said. His warning comes as industry analysis of deliveries from Britain to high-street supermarket chains in Northern Ireland found that firms could incur costs of more than £100,000 per lorry unless the special Brexit arrangements for the region were sorted out.
The new protocols involving customs and food certification checks begin in January next year whether the UK’s future relationship with the EU is agreed or not. Ireland has expressed renewed concerns that there would not be a trade deal that could at least mitigate some of the worst effects of Brexit on Northern Ireland. Coveney said progress in talks over the future relationship between the European Union and UK “has not been good”. “Unless there is significant progress in those negotiating rounds then I think we are going to reach yet another crisis point in the Brexit negotiations, which from the Irish point of view is very, very serious,” he told RTE’s Sean O’Rourke show. The current talks relate to the future relationship with the EU centring on not just trade, but data, medical and scientific research, security and policing with a December deadline. The transition period can be extended and many have called for an extension because of the coronavirus pandemic. Downing Street has recently and repeatedly said the UK does not need an extension. But the rules for Northern Ireland involving customs, security and health checks on animal and food products entering Northern Ireland kick in whether the UK and the EU strike an agreement about their future relationship or not. Aodhán Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium (NIRC), said it was deeply concerned that the detail of the protocol that was signed off by the UK and the EU as part of the withdrawal agreement last year had not been worked out. “Quite frankly, I can’t see how we will be ready by the end of the year. We have no clarity on how this protocol is going to work and it is May. We have seven months to get this sorted and not only have we had no guidance but we have had no conversations with government or Whitehall,” he said. Under the protocol, there will be new controls and checks on goods entering the region from the rest of the UK in order to avoid checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland.
NIRC calculated the cost of a truck delivering groceries to a household name supermarket in Northern Ireland. About 1,400 product types were found to be on the truck, all of which, under the normal EU rules for trade with third countries, would require an entry summary declaration form, which would cost “between £15 and £56” per declaration or between £21,000 and £79,000 for the lorry load. Of the 1,400 goods, 500 were food lines of animal or plant origin, which would require a health certificate at £200 each. “All of this is the worst case scenario but it illustrates the scale of the problem. Our hope is that there is some sort of free-trade agreement or agreement of some sort that it won’t come to pass,” he said. Seamus Leheny, the policy manager at the Freight Transport Association Northern Ireland, said the problem would be easily solved if “derogations and mitigations were put in place”. But he said that since the deal was agreed last October, there had been no engagement on the detail and just general promises of “unfettered access”. Business leaders in Northern Ireland have been asking for the revival of a working group that examined “alternative arrangements” for the Irish border at the now defunct Department for Exiting the EU to tease out the new rules for Northern Ireland. “We have been asking for this since October and have heard nothing,” said Connolly. Business leaders have also expressed frustration over the row about the UK rejecting an EU request to have an office presence in Belfast. “It makes sense if the EU have a formal office. It means if something goes wrong, say in Belfast port, we can call them and have someone sort it out or investigate it locally rather than having to phone someone down in Dublin and get them to come up. They have just turned this into a political football,” said Leheny."
2020-05-05T13:22:13Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson boasted of shaking hands on day Sage warned not to,"No 10’s scientific advisers warned that the government should tell people not to shake hands on the same day that Boris Johnson boasted about doing so “with everybody” at a hospital where there were confirmed coronavirus patients. Advice from a sub-group of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said on 3 March that the government should “advise against greetings such as shaking hands and hugging, given existing evidence about the importance of hand hygiene”. “A public message against shaking hands has additional value as a signal about the importance of hand hygiene,” the Independent Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B) said. “Promoting a replacement greeting or encouraging others to politely decline a proffered handshake may have benefit.”
However, that same day Johnson told a press conference that he was continuing to shake hands with people. “I was at a hospital the other night where I think there were a few coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody, you will be pleased to know, and I continue to shake hands,” he said. “People obviously can make up their own minds but I think the scientific evidence is … our judgment is that washing your hands is the crucial thing.” At that time, his main public health message was that people should wash their hands while singing Happy Birthday twice. Politicians and scientists at the press conferences were still standing close together at their podiums. Several later came down with coronavirus, including Johnson.
Even if he had not yet received the advice that day, he was still seen shaking hands two days later, with the television presenter Phillip Schofield, and with the boxer Anthony Joshua on 9 March. Johnson was confirmed as having coronavirus almost three weeks later on 27 March. His spokesman said Johnson “wouldn’t have seen” the advice before the press conference at which he boasted about continuing to shake hands. The spokesman insisted the prime minister had taken other precautions, including regular handwashing, and that he changed his behaviour when the official advice changed. He added that the paper was not direct advice to ministers, but had been prepared to contribute to the debate on Sage. “In general, in relation to the Sage papers [published on Tuesday], they were papers that had been considered by Sage, and informed the advice that was provided to ministers: they’re not Sage’s advice to ministers.”"
2020-05-05T09:11:03Z,politics,Politics,Tory MPs call for funerals to be held inside churches again,"A group of Tory MPs has urged the Church of England to allow funerals to be held in churches again on a small scale. Former cabinet ministers Liam Fox and Theresa Villiers are among the 36 Tories who have written to bishops to argue the “the wishes of the deceased and bereaved are not being fulfilled with a proper committal in the church of their wish”. Church of England clergy are conducting ceremonies at crematoriums and outside in churchyards but not inside church buildings because of the risks of the spread of coronavirus. The letter from Conservatives, organised by West Dorset MP Chris Loder and signed by 35 colleagues, said: “The grief of bereavement is being translated to trauma in many cases, especially where it is resulting in the tragedy of direct cremation. “The government guidance is clear: funerals, with proper measures in place, are permitted and indeed encouraged.” Ahead of a virtual meeting of bishops on Tuesday, they urged the Church of England to “consider, most intently, the pain and anguish of those families unable to have a funeral” and allow their “compassion to shine through in your considerations and deliberations today”. In response, the Rev Dr Brendan McCarthy, the Church of England’s adviser on healthcare policy, said: “The death of a loved one is painful under any circumstances and the current situation has made this all the more difficult for those who have been bereaved. “The House of Bishops has been meeting frequently and advice is reviewed regularly and updated as circumstances allow. The Church of England has consistently stated that it will always ensure that, where requested, a priest is present to conduct a funeral service, either at a crematorium or at the churchyard. “Any suggestion that the Church of England is responsible for ‘direct cremation’ could not be further from the truth – that is against both government guidance and the Church’s commitment to provide pastoral care for all. “The advice not to conduct funeral services in church buildings – and it is advice, not instruction – was given because of concerns about parishes having capacity to conduct funerals safely, including being able to deep-clean church buildings between services.”"

I will be closing the live feed today. Below is a summary of the latest developments. Please do get in touch to share any news tips and insights. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said just over 85,000 coronavirus tests took place yesterday. Thatâ€™s a second day where the headline total has fallen below 100,000, the target for the end of April. The work and pensions secretary, ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey, has been updating MPs on her departmentâ€™s work in tackling the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis. She said the â€œhidden heroesâ€� in her department had processed an extraordinary 1.8m new claims for universal credit (UC) since mid-March â€“ as well as 250,000 claims for jobseekerâ€™s allowance (JSA), and 20,000 for employment support allowance (ESA). Councils could restrict access to rubbish tips by only allowing cars with particular number plates to visit on a given day, the local government secretary has said. Last week MPs on the Commons culture committee had a frustrating time at a hearing when they tried to get answers from representatives of Facebook, Google and Twitter about what they were doing to halt the spread of disinformation about coronavirus. Now Julian Knight, the committee chair, has written to the three companies with a series of follow-up questions. In a statement he accused them of being â€œdeeply unhelpfulâ€�."
2020-05-04T17:51:39Z,politics,Politics,UK's plans to reopen workplaces: what are unions' concerns?,"Ministers have shared seven documents with employer groups and trade unions on how some companies could ask staff to return to their workplaces. However, unions are worried about many aspects of the draft advice produced by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). Using physical barriers and PPE Employers who cannot guarantee gaps of 2 metres between workers will be advised that physical barriers can be used, like the screens used to protect supermarket checkout workers. Other ideas include floor markings to encourage people to space out, and people working facing away from each other. The documents also float the use of more personal protective equipment (PPE), such as goggles, face masks and gloves, without being specific about how that would work. Staff should be advised to avoid sharing equipment, including pens.
Concerns: Trade unions are worried about the lack of public scientific guidance about what circumstances make physical barriers as effective as physical distancing. Likewise, they want more detail on who should be wearing PPE, and when and how they can get access to it. Limiting close working to 15 minutes Public Health England (PHE) has long said the risk of contracting the coronavirus is lower if interactions are limited to 15 minutes, but more emphasis may be placed on this advice so that brief meetings are possible. Concerns: Prospect is one of the unions questioning this advice, asking for the scientific evidence to be published on why 15 minutes is considered an acceptable period of time. The advice appears to be based on the theory that the risk of contracting coronavirus increases the longer someone stays in the presence of an infected colleague, but it is not clear why 15 minutes is used as the cut-off point. Frequent cleaning and better hygiene measures The guidance is vague on this issue, suggesting employers could consider more deep cleaning without setting out minimum standards that everyone would have to abide by. It also proposes more hygiene measures, such as making hand sanitiser available at exits and entries, and near frequently touched places such as lifts. Concerns: There are worries about the lack of specific instructions on how surfaces should be kept clean, the type of disinfectants that should be used and frequency of cleaning. At the moment, the guidance seems to leave this up to employers’ discretion. Staggering start times One option for those who do have to go into work could be shifts, to avoid too many people being in the office at once, and so that public transport is not too crowded. Guidance includes asking companies to limit the number of people sharing lifts, with graphics showing how they could be divided into one-person sections. Concerns: The rail unions are very unhappy at talk of greatly increased train services by the week beginning 11 May, as they do not think adequate safety provisions have been made for passengers and staff to be able to maintain distancing. This is likely to be a particular problem on the London tube, where carriages are usually overcrowded. Risk assessments The government will require all firms with more than five people to produce a written risk assessment showing they have thought through all the health and safety consequences of asking people to return to the workplace. Concerns: Unions would like to see each firm asked to publish their risk assessments so employees and the wider public can see their workings about the risks they are asking staff to take. The TUC would also like to see the Health and Safety Executive have some powers to enforce safe working conditions, rather than companies being asked to follow non-binding guidance. Protecting the vulnerable Shielded people who are “extremely clinically vulnerable” would not be required to work outside the home. But vulnerable people, including pregnant women, people with many underlying health conditions and the over-70 , would still be allowed to work outside their homes. Employers would only be asked to take extra care with physical distancing measures for them where possible. Concerns: Unions want stronger protections for vulnerable people to be able to stay at home or ask to be furloughed to avoid situations where they are at risk. They are concerned at the number of opt-outs for employers, who can argue they are making reasonable adjustments while still asking their vulnerable employees to come into the office, often by public transport."
2020-05-04T16:33:48Z,politics,Politics,Who will be Labour general secretary? Some possible contenders,"Whoever becomes Labour’s next general secretary will have to win over most of the party’s national executive committee, where Sir Keir Starmer now commands a slim majority. Here are some potential candidates for the role. Morgan McSweeney Chief of staff to Starmer, with strong local government connections, the former campaign director of Liz Kendall’s failed leadership bid would be a popular choice among MPs and those loyal to the new leader. But he may struggle to win support from the unions, who traditionally occupy the role of general secretary. Lisa Johnson Among the favourites to replace Formby, the director of external relations at the GMB union is known as an extremely capable backroom dealer who has guided the union through tricky times with employers and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party. Her allies say she was among union officials who urged the GMB’s general secretary, Tim Roache, to step down last week. Emilie Oldknow The Unison official and Labour’s executive director for governance, membership and party services was seen as a frontrunner for the job until a controversial leaked antisemitism report claimed she had made inappropriate comments about colleagues. She has denied any wrongdoing. Anneliese Midgley A popular member of Jeremy Corbyn’s 2015 leadership campaign, she would be expected to command the support of many on the left of the party. She may suffer objections from some Starmer supporters because, like Formby, she is a Unite-backed official and is closely associated with Corbyn ally Len McCluskey.
Brian Roy Scottish Labour’s former general secretary stood down in August after a row about the party’s position on a second independence referendum. He has been mentioned as a possible candidate by some on the right of the party. Candidate from outside the party Some Labour sources have hinted that Starmer may wish to break with tradition and look for a candidate outside the party – an organiser from a third-sector body who will shake up the structures of the party without setting up their own power base."
2020-05-04T14:31:31Z,politics,Politics,Conor Burns: the Eurosceptic stalwart who befriended Thatcher,"A self-described “Catholic unionist” from a Belfast family who took pleasure in singing Irish nationalist ballads, the background of Conor Burns might seem to some at odds with his long-term profile as one of the younger Eurosceptic stalwarts of the Conservative party. Yet the Tory MP, who has resigned as a trade minister, proudly insisted in the past that neither his religion, birthplace nor the fact that he is gay had inhibited his rise through Tory ranks. Another feature of that rise was a friendship with the late Margaret Thatcher, whom he reportedly met in 1997 after driving her husband, Denis, back from a golf outing. “DT insisted that I come in ‘and meet the boss’,” Burns later recalled. The former prime minister would go on to support a number of attempts by Burns to enter parliament, including when she defied doctor’s orders to make a rare public address to launch the activist’s ill-fated attempt to become the Tory MP for Eastleigh in 2001. A former chairman of Southampton University Conservative Association, Burns was backed by Norman Tebbit to be the party’s student director and also worked for another noted Eurosceptic, Bill Cash. Other roles came at DeHavilland, the political and public affairs company, in finance with Zurich Advice Network and as a vice-president of the Young Britons’ Foundation, an organisation, since closed, which was dubbed “the Conservative madrasa” because of its radical views. His Westminster breakthrough came in 2010 when he was elected as MP for Bournemouth West, and he went on to serve as parliamentary private secretary to five different ministers, including under Johnson when he was foreign secretary. During that time, Burns claimed that his Twitter account was hacked after tweets were sent to the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, demanding details of the UK’s payment obligations to Brussels. Burns followed Johnson out the door when the latter resigned from his ministerial post in 2018 amid opposition to the Brexit plans of the then prime minister, Theresa May.
Burns’s loyalty was rewarded when Johnson became prime minister, and he was appointed minister of state for trade policy in July 2019. The role gave him responsibilities for policy on areas including trade agreements, barriers to markets and international education exports. Previous roles have also included a stint as chairman of the all-party group on Bahrain, during which time he defended the kingdom’s record on human rights and urged Britain not to turn its back on it."
2020-05-04T14:22:02Z,politics,Politics,"Coronavirus plan for returning to work puts employees at risk, says TUC","Britain’s trade union body has warned the government’s draft guidelines for getting employees back to work during the coronavirus crisis will put people’s health at risk and cannot be supported in their current form. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), criticised the non-binding guidelines for letting employers decide what is safe when it comes to distance between workers, cleaning practices and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).
Labour threw its weight behind the TUC’s concerns. Andy McDonald, the shadow employment rights minister, criticised the fact that unions had been being given only 12 hours at the weekend to respond to the proposals. “The entire country wants the government to succeed, but this is not how to build confidence or trust,” he said. “The proposals talk about what they expect employers to ‘consider’, and say social distancing and handwashing ‘should’ happen, where possible, to help – with insufficient attention being paid to PPE. Taking the necessary steps to protect employees is not a matter of expectation or guidance, it is the law.” Speaking at business department questions in a virtual Commons debate, McDonald asked for confirmation that risk assessments would be published, and lodged with the Health and Safety Executive. Amanda Solloway, the science minister, replied that her department was negotiating with employers and unions, to “come to a shared view” about the issue. Boris Johnson is preparing to set out on Sunday how restrictions can be eased but before that business groups and trade unions have been sent draft guidelines for how to protect people if physical distancing rules cannot be followed. Suggestions include physical shields, time limits on face-to-face meetings, and staggered shift times. In a letter to Alok Sharma, the business secretary, O’Grady said unions would have “no hesitation” in telling their members that the guidelines cannot protect workers unless they were significantly strengthened – a move that could lead to many refusing requests to get back to work. The letter, seen by the Guardian, says: “Working people need to see that the government is genuinely committed to protecting their health and safety. At present, this guidance fails to provide clear direction to those employers who want to act responsibly and is an open goal to the worst of employers who want to return to business at usual – which will put their workforce at risk … “We want to be able to recommend the government’s approach to safe working to our members and the wider workforce. As it stands, we cannot.” Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, said on Monday employees could return to work with physical shields to separate them from colleagues, personal protective equipment (PPE) and limits on time spent close to each other. He said there was a range of measures that could be used in workplaces where maintaining a two-metre distance between colleagues was not possible.
Wallace told the BBC that supermarket shoppers were not two metres away from those working at the tills but were instead separated by physical shields. “Potentially, shields or PPE is a way forward,” he said. Wallace also highlighted the “use of time” as another tool: “You could be closer than two metres but not for long,” he said. According to sources who have seen the guidelines, other workplace measures include reduced hot-desking and staggered shift times. The document urges employers to minimise the number of staff using equipment and maximise home working. However, a section marked PPE contains only a promise that more detail would follow. It also does not go into detail about how pregnant women, older workers and other vulnerable groups should be treated, and appears to leave many decisions up to employers about what they consider safe. For example, one section says employers could consider limiting how many people are in a vehicle, without saying how many the government considers would be safe.
In her letter to Sharma, O’Grady ﻿said the government appeared to have “entirely disregarded” TUC suggestions about how a safer system of working could operate in practice. “This has left me with no choice but to write to you directly to ask that you make immediate and substantial changes to your approach,” she said. “The consultation papers suggest government proposes a return to business as usual, with no new requirements placed on employers beyond existing health and safety law, and no government commitment to increased health and safety enforcement or public awareness of their health and safety rights. “We believe this approach will risk the safety and wellbeing of workers as they return to work. If the guidance is not significantly strengthened, safe working will not be guaranteed, and unions will have no hesitation in saying so publicly and to our members.” She said some of the proposed guidance was in some cases weaker than existing legislation and listed the TUC’s most pressing concerns: The non-binding nature of the guidance, which repeatedly suggests that “employers should consider” actions such as enabling physical distancing or providing hand washing facilities. “We believe that this leaves far too much to employer discretion,” she said The lack of recommendations on PPE The failure to require employers to publish their risk assessments, nor to agree them with recognised unions An absence of reference to enforcement mechanisms such as the Health and Safety Executive’s existing powers to issue prohibition notices, and to workers’ existing rights to refuse to work in situations which present a serious and imminent danger to them A lack of specific guidelines for those in vulnerable groups, for example, pregnant women, which appears to suggest that they can be expected to work in unsafe environments, in violation of their existing rights under health and safety law. Other concerns include the lack of detail on how workers can be expected to travel safely to work, how parents without childcare can be expected to work while nurseries and other settings are closed, and the rights of those who care for someone who is shielding and on future access to the job retention scheme."
2020-05-04T11:23:53Z,politics,Politics,Jennie Formby resigns as Labour party general secretary,"Jennie Formby, the Labour general secretary who was a close ally of the former leader Jeremy Corbyn, has resigned from the post, the party has announced. The move gives the party leader, Sir Keir Starmer, an opportunity to anoint a new candidate to control the party machine, and is further illustration of a major political shift since December’s general election. A statement released on behalf of Formby on Monday said: “When I applied for the role of general secretary in 2018 it was because I wanted to support Jeremy Corbyn, who inspired so many people to get involved in politics with his message of hope, equality and peace. “It has been a huge privilege to be general secretary of the largest political party in Europe for the last two years, but now we have a new leadership team it is the right time to step down. “I would like to thank Jeremy, our members and my staff colleagues who have given me so much support during what has been a very challenging period, in particular when I was suffering from ill-health. “I wish Keir and Angela the very best of luck in taking the party forward and leading Labour to victory at the next general election.” Formby, a former Unite official and close associate of Len McCluskey, took over as general secretary, the party’s most senior employee, in March 2018. She received treatment for breast cancer last year. Allies of Starmer had said privately her resignation would be key to allowing the new leader to control the direction of the party. A meeting of the national executive committee will be expected to set a timetable to elect a new general secretary. Potential candidates to succeed Formby are thought to include the Unite political director, Anneliese Midgley, the Unison official Emilie Oldknow and GMB’s director of external relations, Lisa Johnson. Allies of Oldknow and Johnson say it is no coincidence that they have been linked to recent controversies after they were flagged as potential successors to Formby. Oldknow has been accused making inappropriate comments about colleagues in the controversial antisemitism report being investigated by the NEC. Johnson has been closely connected to Tim Roache, the recently resigned GMB general secretary who is under investigation for inappropriate conduct. Her supporters insist she was among the senior figures pushing for his resignation in recent days. Formby’s resignation means that most of left of the party, which until December’s general election controlled all key positions, have been removed. Focus will now fall on whether Karie Murphy, another key Corbyn ally, will remain as a senior member of the party’s leadership. Responding to the decision, Starmer said: “I would like to thank Jennie for her service, and for the personal and professional efforts she has made in advancing the cause she has fought all her life for. “Jennie has led our party’s organisation with commitment and energy through a period of political upheaval, including a snap general election last year. I wish her the very best for the future.” Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “As a trade unionist and party activist as well as general secretary, Jennie has been a great servant of our movement for many years and blazed a trail as one of our highest achieving women. “She goes with our thanks and gratitude, and I’ve no doubt she will stand squarely behind us as we continue to fight for social justice and the Labour government our country so desperately needs.”"
2020-05-04T10:34:19Z,politics,Politics,UK trade minister Conor Burns resigns over loan threats,"A close ally of Boris Johnson has resigned as a minister after being found to have used his position to try to intimidate a member of the public. The international trade minister, Conor Burns, was found by the standards committee to have made a series of veiled threats while attempting to intervene in his father’s dispute over a loan. The committee recommended a suspension from parliament over multiple breaches of the MPs’ code before No 10 announced his resignation. A Downing Street spokesman said Burns had resigned after the committee’s report.
The commissioner for standards received a complaint from a member of the public connected to a firm with which Burns’s father was in dispute over the repayment of a loan. The complaint centred on a letter sent by Burns, which claimed his father had made extensive attempts over a period of years to reach a settlement on repayment of that loan. In the letter, written in February 2019 on House of Commons notepaper, Burns stated he was writing on his father’s behalf enclosing an earlier letter sent by his father to the company to which, he stated, no response had been received. “I am acutely aware that my role in the public eye could well attract interest especially if I were to use parliamentary privilege to raise the case (on which I have taken advice from the house authorities),” Burns wrote. The MP suggested the complainant, a former senior civil servant whose name was redacted from House of Commons documents, could avoid having him raise the case in the Commons by securing the payment of the loan to his father. Burns noted the complainant’s “high-profile role” outside the company “could well add to that attention”. By raising the case during parliamentary proceedings, Burns’s words would have been protected from a legal challenge by parliamentary privilege. When confronted by Kathryn Stone, the commissioner for standards, Burns said he had not sought formal advice. Stone said his behaviour “gives fuel to the belief that members are able and willing to use the privileges accorded them by their membership of the house to benefit their own personal interests”. “The content of the letter suggests the use of the principal emblem of the house was more deliberate than accidental. And, as I explained in my letter to Mr Burns of 11 June 2019, his reference to having sought advice about privilege from the house authorities was misleading,” Stone wrote. The report released by the standards committee found that he had also misused parliamentary-headed notepaper. It accused Burns of behaving “disrespectfully” during the investigation and of claiming he had not received a memo from Stone over several months. The cross-party committee recommended he should apologise in writing to the Commons and to the individual concerned – a recommendation that will need to be signed off by the Commons. “The right of members of parliament to speak in the chamber without fear or favour is essential to parliament’s ability to scrutinise the executive and to tackle social abuses, particularly if the latter are committed by the rich and powerful who might use the threat of defamation proceedings to deter legitimate criticism. “Precisely because parliamentary privilege is so important, it is essential to maintaining public respect for parliament that the protection afforded by privilege should not be abused by a member in the pursuit of their purely private and personal interests,” the report said. Burns, 47, was made a trade minister in July when Johnson became Conservative leader and was a key member of his campaign team. He was elected to represent Bournemouth West in 2010 and defended his seat in 2015, 2017 and 2019. He served as parliamentary private secretary to Johnson when he was foreign secretary but resigned from the post in July 2018. Burns expressed his regret in a tweet on Monday. “With deep regret I have decided to resign as Minister of State for International Trade. @BorisJohnson will continue to have my wholehearted support from the backbenches,” he said. In a separate development, another minister at the Department for International Trade, Greg Hands, was ordered on Monday to apologise for misusing parliamentary stationery to send a letter to thousands of constituents. In October 2019, the Chelsea and Fulham MP had told the commissioner he was willing to publicly acknowledge he had breached the rules, apologise and reimburse the £4,865 costs. But with the election looming, Hands changed his mind. The committee said: “It is hard to avoid the conclusion that Mr Hands may well have been motivated by a desire to avoid the embarrassment of having to make a public apology for breaking parliamentary rules during a general election campaign.”"
2020-05-04T06:13:59Z,politics,Politics,Coronavirus UK: health passports 'possible in months',"Tech firms are in talks with ministers about creating health passports to help Britons return safely to work using coronavirus testing and facial recognition. Facial biometrics could be used to help provide a digital certificate – sometimes known as an immunity passport – proving which workers have had Covid-19, as a possible way of easing the impact on the economy and businesses from ongoing physical distancing even after current lockdown measures are eased. The UK-based firm Onfido, which specialises in verifying people’s identities using facial biometrics, has delivered detailed plans to the government and is involved in a number of conversations about what could be rolled out across the country, it is understood. Its proposals, which have reached pilot stages in other countries, could be executed within months, it says. The firm could use antibody tests – proving whether someone has had the virus – or antigen tests, which show current infections. Digital identity experts say they are in the “discovery stage” of what could be tailored for the UK government, but developing a type of health certificate through app technology is gaining traction. The government is understood to be moving away from the phrase “immunity passport” as evidence continues to emerge on exactly how immunity develops after someone has had Covid-19. The World Health Organization has also issued a stark warning over attempts to give people false assurance through a passport scheme. On Monday, Boris Johnson will call on countries to come together in a “truly global effort” to defeat the coronavirus as he co-hosts a virtual Coronavirus Global Response International Pledging Conference, and confirms the UK’s promise of £388m funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatments. It comes ahead of the prime minister outlining a “roadmap” out of lockdown, including the need to tackle workers’ fears of being in close proximity to others. Over the weekend, two firms made breakthroughs on developing antibody tests. The Swiss drugmaker Roche received emergency use approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for a test they have developed, while Quotient, in Edinburgh, says its screening machines have capacity for up to 36,000 antibody tests a day and produce results in 35 minutes with 99.8% accuracy. These are lab-based tests, however, relying on blood to be taken by a medical professional and requiring large machines for analysis, taking time. The holy grail in antibody testing is a home pregnancy test-style kit that would provide almost instant results. So far none on the market, including 17.5m ordered by the government, have been demonstrated as sufficiently accurate. Typically these tests produce false negatives about half to 70% of the time.
Onfido, which is in talks with ministers, was founded by three former Oxford University students in 2012 and has worked with Monzo and Zipcar. It says it has the ability to roll out a system within months and could be the “linchpin of the new normality” and stimulating the economy. Their solution would embed Onfido technology within another organisation’s app to establish someone’s identity. The person would be asked to take a selfie and an image of their government-issued identification, such as a passport or driver’s licence. The technology can determine whether the person’s face matches their ID, and also if the ID is genuine. This creates a digital identity. They are then tested for coronavirus under a system endorsed by the government and the result is stored by another provider – in the UK this would most likely be the NHS. When the person goes to their workplace, they open the app, take a photo of their face and that unlocks a QR code. That QR code would be scanned by reception using simple camera technology and on their system they would see the test result and a photo of the employee’s face for a short time, allowing them to visually determine the identity of the person in front of them. The only technology a business would need to make this work would be a camera to take an image of the QR code as they arrive. No information about someone’s name, date of birth, address would be visible to the person on reception, only that they are fit to go into work. There are remaining questions about the extent to which the presence of antibodies in the blood ensures immunity. Early reports of apparent Covid-19 reinfections in South Korea now appear to have been explained by a combination of false negative results and because the body’s healing response can lead to infected cells from the lungs being expelled weeks after initial infection, causing people to test positive even though they are recovering. However, many experts still think it likely that immunity will wane over a period of months or years, potentially leaving people vulnerable – and some people could acquire more robust immunity than others. A government source said a form of certification system is “still on the table and being considered” and that conversations around this concept fall under the government’s “track and trace” plans."
2020-05-03T07:43:46Z,politics,Politics,No-deal Brexit could wreck UKâ€™s chance of leading Covid-19 global research,"The future of Britain’s world-renowned science sector – and its ability to lead global research into Covid-19 – risks being fatally undermined if the UK crashes out of the EU without a trade deal by the end of this year. The warning has been issued by leading scientists – including UK-based Nobel prize winners – as fears grow that British science could lose access to the EU’s €100bn (£85bn) research funding scheme, Horizon Europe, which will run from 2021 to 2027. The government says it is “considering” applying to be an “associate member” (a relationship available for non-member states at the discretion of the 27 member nations) of Horizon Europe and the European Research Council (ERC), which is a component of the funding scheme. The ERC says one of its UK-based “grantees”, Prof Cecilia Mascolo, is already working in this country on rolling out a mobile app to quickly diagnose Covid-19. But with the EU-UK talks on a trade deal stalled, and Boris Johnson saying he will not seek an extension to the UK transition (which ends on 31 December) or pay extra budget contributions to prolong UK involvement, there are fears that a deal on British membership of the science funding schemes could be impossible to strike. Last week, the UK science minister, Amanda Sollaway, tweeted about how well home-based scientists had done from the European scheme. “Congratulations to all those who have been successful in the Horizon 2020 Proof of Concept awards,” she wrote. “UK applicants were awarded the largest number of grants – 13 awards! I wish all the winners success in exploring and developing their ideas further.”
Since the start of the current EU scheme, Horizon 2020 (which will be succeeded by Horizon Europe), the UK has received more than £1.5bn in ERC income and £776m in MSCA (Marie Skłodowska Curie Actions) grants – more than any other EU country, and a fifth of the total. But Sir Andre Geim, a Nobel prize-winning scientist based at Manchester University, said it was “difficult to remain optimistic” about the future of UK science. “The coronavirus will surely make a huge dent in our economy with inevitable negative consequences for the science budget. If the virus does not suffocate the UK fundamental research, a no-deal Brexit will surely be the coup de grâce,” he said. Another distinguished scientist, Professor Bart De Strooper, director of the UK Dementia Research Institute, said he was deeply frustrated. “Frankly, I think that it is a small disaster for UK research becoming deprived from this funding stream. I hardly see how we will catch up from a UK perspective and I think that already serious damage has been caused,” he said. “Under other circumstances we would have attracted many ERC grants to my new institute, but this strategy has been aborted by the uncertainty and the lack of guidance by consecutive UK governments over the last three years. We were extremely early in diagnosis of Covid-19 … and in testing and understanding the impact of Covid on our frail patients. “I feel very frustrated that we will not be able to tap the European funds to grow this institute even further. We could have become the biggest dementia initiative in Europe.”
Sir Paul Nurse, another Nobel winner and head of the Francis Crick Institute – the UK’s leading medical and biological research centre – said: “My view is that it would be very good for British science to have associate membership with the EU Horizon scheme. However, I am not sure that this will be a priority for the government’s negotiations concerning EU exit.” Richard Catlow, the Foreign Secretary of the Royal Society and a chemistry professor at University College London, said: “Continued association with Europe is the best option for UK science, and there is a consensus among the scientific community that it should continue. If the UK wants to continue benefiting it will have to keep contributing, as clearly it is not going to get something for nothing.” A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “The UK is a science superpower, and we are increasing public investment in R&D to £22bn by 2024-25 – the largest and fastest increase on record. “The UK is considering participation in EU programmes where they represent a real benefit to British people and industry and provide convincing value for money. This includes Horizon Europe, and negotiations are ongoing on the potential terms of UK participation.” UK involvement in several EU agencies and funding projects including Horizon is a key part of the EU-UK trade deal negotiations. The UK has until the end of June to ask for an extension to the transition period to smooth its exit from the EU. But Johnson has insisted he will not ask for an extension that would involve paying a post-Brexit contribution into the EU budget."
2020-05-02T12:32:26Z,politics,Politics,Row over EU office in Belfast threatens to derail Brexit talks,"The Irish border question threatens to derail Brexit talks again as the depth of the row over the EU’s desire to have an office in Belfast is revealed. The UK’s paymaster general, Penny Mordaunt, has written to the EU to firmly reject a repeated request for an office in Northern Ireland: “The UK cannot agree to the permanent EU presence based in Belfast,” she wrote. Mordaunt was responding to a second request this year from the EU for permission to open an office in Belfast on the grounds it was needed to oversee the implementation of new customs and regulatory checks that will apply to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland from next year.
According to the Irish national broadcaster, RTÉ, the secretary general of the EU’s external action service, Helga Schmid, wrote in February that there were “very particular capabilities and competences” required on the ground, “distinctive from the more traditional competences of any other EU delegation”. She hoped the office would be up and running by June in order to bed down the new processes for traders, the detail of which has been the cause of major political rows. Boris Johnson has insisted there will be no checks and no new paperwork for traders operating across the Irish sea. The permanent undersecretary at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Sir Simon McDonald, refused Schmid’s request in March, but she argued in a follow-up letter on 25 March that an office would be necessary. “At least during the initial phase of the application of the protocol, the EU will want to avail of these rights on an ongoing basis. To do so effectively, an office in Belfast staffed by technical experts is indispensable,” she wrote. Mordaunt rejected her argument, saying such a presence would be “divisive in political and community terms”. The government said in a statement on Saturday: “There is no reason why the commission should require a permanent presence in Belfast to monitor the implementation of the protocol.” The row over the office in Belfast has been simmering for months with no sign of a resolution. Theresa May’s former Brexit adviser Raoul Ruparel tweeted on Saturday:
He rejected reports that the UK had agreed to an EU office in February 2019 and was now backtracking. As May’s adviser at the time, he said no such agreement had been signed off on a political level. He pointed out that it would have been anathema to the Democratic Unionist party, which May was trying to keep onside ahead of a meaningful vote on the withdrawal agreement. Even if the UK had agreed to an office last year, it would have had different functions, because May’s Irish border solution was a UK-wide arrangement that would not have involved customs and tariffs on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, he said. The row illustrates the EU’s concerns that the UK will try to row back on the deal signed in January and not implement customs and regulatory checks on animals and food entering the island of Ireland. This would cause a major international headache because it would force checks back to the Irish border, something many have said could jeopardise peace."
2020-05-02T06:00:15Z,politics,Politics,UK seeks access to EU health cooperation in light of coronavirus,"The British government is quietly seeking access to the European Union’s pandemic warning system, despite early reluctance to cooperate on health after Brexit, the Guardian has learned. The UK is seeking “something akin to membership” of the EU’s early warning and response system (EWRS), which has played a critical role in coordinating Europe’s response to the coronavirus, as well as to earlier pandemics such as bird flu. According to an EU source, this would be “pretty much the same” as membership of the system. The government’s enthusiasm in the privacy of the negotiating room contrasts with noncommittal public statements. Detailed negotiating objectives published in February merely stated that the UK was “open to exploring cooperation between the UK and EU in other specific and narrowly defined areas where this is in the interest of both sides, for example on matters of health security”. Health was not even mentioned in the government’s written statement to Parliament, aside from a reference to pharmaceuticals. Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph reported on 1 March that No 10 had blocked the Department of Health’s request to be part of the EWRS. A government spokesperson did not respond to a question about whether the UK was seeking a form of membership or participation in the EWRS, but referred back to the February negotiating objectives. In private, the coronavirus, which had claimed at least 26,771 lives in the UK by Thursday, appears to have altered government thinking. “There was not much appetite from the UK at the beginning,” said the EU source, referring to cooperation on health. “That’s been corrected. They are keen and they are keen to be seen to be keen. Both sides want close cooperation.” However, the EU is not prepared to offer the UK full membership of the EWRS, an online platform set up in 1998 where public authorities share information about health emergencies. Instead, EU officials propose to “plug the UK into” the system when a pandemic emerges, similar to arrangements for other non-EU countries. Health security does not feature in the UK negotiating text sent in private to the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, although EU officials have received a “non-paper” outlining government aims on health.
In another sign of rising British interest in European cooperation, the Guardian has established that the UK attended all five of the EU’s health security committee meetings on the coronavirus pandemic in April, a perfect attendance record, compared with a 70% British presence between 17 January and 30 March. During the April meetings, officials discussed lockdown exit strategies and launching a joint procurement scheme on therapeutics in intensive care. No decision has been taken to launch this bulk-buying programme. The Guardian first reported in March that the UK was not taking part in any of the EU’s four procurement schemes, missing bulk-buying efforts on personal protective equipment for medical workers, ventilators and testing kit – despite having attended relevant meetings. Meanwhile, among NHS senior managers there is anxiety that Brexit talks risk “significant elements of health being forgotten about”, said Layla McCay, the international director of the NHS Confederation. “NHS organisations have been stood up and stood down and stood up again for potentially a no-deal Brexit,” she said. “If a quite thorough future relationship for health matters is not on track come June, then the NHS is going to have to start to prepare for specific disruption next year as a result of Brexit, and it will have to do so while also facing both winter and coronavirus challenges. It will be a significant extra ask.” British membership of the EWRS and broader EU health network “strengthen our ability to respond as effectively as possible” to health emergencies, McCay added. The UK government spokesperson said: “The safety and security of our citizens is a top priority. The UK is ready to discuss how our citizens can be kept safe and benefit from continued international cooperation on health security following the end of the transition period, where it is in our mutual interest. “Any such arrangements must align with the fundamental principles of respecting the UK’s political and economic independence, recognition of the UK and EU’s status as sovereign equals, and ensuring the UK has control over its own laws.”"
2020-05-01T18:16:22Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: government says counting of tests unchanged amid claims tally is inflated â€“ as it happened,"The government said it passed its 100,000 tests per day target, amid claims the tally has been artificially boosted. At the daily press briefing Matt Hancock said as of 9am today there were 122,347 tests in the UK, a significant rise on Thursdayâ€™s figure of 81,611. However, the HSJ reported that the government was including home-testing kits sent out by post in the tally of tests to reach the target, even if the recipient has not yet provided and returned their sample. It was claimed that, until recently, tests were only recorded in the daily count once they had been sent to a laboratory for analysis. The government, however, denied there had been a change. Deprived areas have double the death rate of affluent ones, new figures from the ONS revealed. The most deprived areas registered 55.1 coronavirus-related deaths per 100,000 people, 118% times that in the least deprived areas where the rate was 25.3 per 100,000. London had the highest mortality rate, with the highest age-standardised mortality rates in the borough of Newham (144.3 deaths per 100,000), followed by Brent (141.5) and Hackney (127.4). Nicola Sturgeon adopted a cautious tone warning that it was â€œnot safeâ€� to lift lockdown restrictions for some time yet. This was in striking contrast with Boris Johnsonâ€™s optimistic tone yesterday that the UK is â€œpast the peakâ€�. The first minister of Scotland appeared concerned at the suggestion that the worst is over, later saying, â€œProgress is fragile and if we ease up it will be reversed. So we need to encourage maximum compliance with current restrictionsâ€�. Face coverings have a â€œweak but positive effectâ€� in slowing the spread of the virus, the PMâ€™s spokesman told the lobby briefing. Ministers have not yet made a final decision on whether the public will be advised to wear face coverings or not, but the advice suggests they have a weak but also positive effect in reducing transmission from asymptomatic people where physical distancing isnâ€™t possible. The housing secretary Robert Jenrick also said this morning wearing one was a â€œpersonal choiceâ€�. Ryanair announced plans for 3,000 job cuts as a direct result of the pandemic. The airline said it expects to operate under 1% of its schedule between April and June, and expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing to 2019 levels to take at least two years. Thatâ€™s it from us on the UK side. Thanks to everybody who got in touch throughout the day with tips and suggestions, and to all of you for reading along.

2020-05-01T18:02:18Z,politics,Politics,Labour appoints panel to investigate leaked report on staff,"Labour’s ruling national executive committee (NEC) has appointed a four-person panel to investigate the leaked internal report describing a “hyper-factional” environment among party staff hostile to Jeremy Corbyn. The unredacted report, which was leaked last month, reignited the row in the party over Labour’s handling of antisemitism cases, and led to calls for party members named in it to be suspended. A party spokesperson said on Friday that Martin Forde QC would chair the investigation, which will cover both the contents of the report, and the circumstances of its release. A spokesperson said Forde would be supported by three experts in “the law and the Labour party’s structures”, and would examine “the circumstances, contents and release of an internal report”. “The NEC has agreed that the investigation should endeavour to deliver its report by the middle of July,” the spokesperson said. The report included hundreds of private WhatsApp messages from named staff members, many of them expressing hostility towards Corbyn or his close allies and bemoaning Labour’s better-than-expected performance at the 2017 general election. The officials discussed funnelling election campaign funds to favoured candidates, including the former deputy leader Tom Watson. The dossier also named complainants in antisemitism cases. It was prepared as a background document, intended to be submitted alongside Labour’s response to the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s investigation into the party. When Labour’s lawyers decided the document should not be submitted, it was leaked. Starmer said at the time he was “shocked” by its contents, and by the fact that it had been published. His handling of the sensitive issue is regarded by both sides of the party as an early test of his leadership. In addition to Forde, the panellists will be three Labour peers: Debbie Wilcox, a former leader of Newport city council; Larry Whitty, a former Labour party general secretary, and Ruth Lister, an emeritus professor of social policy at Loughborough University. Some leftwing NEC members objected to the makeup of the panel. They argued for the veteran campaigner Lord Dubs, who is Jewish, to be included – but were defeated 18-16 in a vote. A Labour source said:, “Keir and Angela [Rayner] hold Alf Dubs in the highest regard, as we all do, but it is crucial that the panel is not just independent but perceived as independent. Keir did not think it would be appropriate for someone who was a high profile supporter in his leadership campaign to be involved.” A spokesperson for Momentum said: “It is critical that the inquiry focus on the very serious allegations of racism, sexism, senior staff members trying to sabotage Labour’s 2017 general election campaign and a failure to pursue antisemitism cases. “In any other organisation, members accused of racism, sexism and misuse of funds would be suspended pending investigation. Labour should be no different, and we call on Labour to suspend those named in the report while the investigation is ongoing.”"
2020-05-01T17:27:15Z,politics,Politics,GMB vows to protect its staff after launch of Tim Roache inquiry,"The president of one of Britain’s biggest unions has vowed to protect the safety of its female workers, after an independent investigation was launched into the personal conduct of its former general secretary.Barbara Plant, president of the GMB union, said the safety of “our people, particularly women” was paramount to her, following allegations made against Tim Roache. Roache, 57, unexpectedly stepped down from the top role in Britain’s third-largest trade union on Tuesday, after being re-elected just five months ago. Initially the GMB, which represents 600,000 workers including ambulance drivers and manufacturing staff, said Roache had taken the “difficult decision” to resign because of ill health. A day later it updated its statement, giving more details about Roache’s health and confirming that an inquiry into claims made against him was under way. It confirmed it had received an anonymous letter a week earlier. Plant and the GMB’s acting general secretary, John Phillips, wrote to all its staff on Friday afternoon thanking them for their resilience and saying it had “been an incredibly difficult few days for everyone”. The letter said “a full, transparent and independent investigation into the number of very serious allegations made by way of an anonymous letter” had been agreed. It added: “In the meantime, the safety and security of all staff is of paramount importance. We are acting with urgency to create a safe space for staff to anonymously raise … [any issues].” They encouraged people to come forward to report any concerns, and promised their full support. On Thursday Plant had tweeted: “The safety of our people, particularly women, and the integrity of our union is paramount to me as GMB national president. I support a fully independent investigation into the serious allegations raised around the departure of our previous GS [general secretary]. “I support a safe space for our people to come forward with any concerns. We stand for dignity or we stand for nothing.” The Guardian has seen an anonymous letter, which purports to be from “concerned GMB staff”, which urged the union “to suspend Tim Roache with immediate effect, pending a full investigation”. On Wednesday, following questions regarding Roache’s conduct, the GMB issued a statement, which said: “GMB received an anonymous letter, last Wednesday, in which a number of allegations have been made about Tim’s conduct whilst he held the office of general secretary.” The statement said Roache – who led the union from 2015 – had been diagnosed some years ago with ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome, and had been advised to refrain from work. Roache, who was often seen as a critic of Jeremy Corbyn, has been a key figure within the union movement. The GMB – which backed Lisa Nandy in the Labour leadership contest – has donated more than £12m to the party over the past five years, according to Electoral Commission records. Earlier on Wednesday, a spokesman for Keir Starmer declined an offer to back Roache following his resignation. Roache has been approached for comment."
2020-05-01T16:15:48Z,politics,Politics,Labour turns to pragmatism for new era's challenging start,"Labour’s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer, gave members of his fresh frontbench team some gentle advice when he began chairing shadow cabinet meetings by videoconference last month: you don’t have to speak for the sake of it. While Jeremy Corbyn’s consensual chairing style involved hearing lengthy contributions from colleagues with contrasting views, Starmer reminds shadow ministers they shouldn’t feel obliged to chip in. With the nation gripped by the Covid-19 crisis, he has taken an equally restrained approach to Labour’s contribution to the national debate – to varying reviews from those on his own side. “Our pragmatic decision is, first of all to engage on the practical things the government could do that would make people’s lives easier,” says Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow work and pensions secretary. “In my area for instance, that’s uprating legacy benefits and ending the benefit cap and the two-child limit in universal credit – rather than saying, ‘Let’s have a universal basic income [UBI]’, or ‘Let’s have a minimum income guarantee.’” But while his supporters have applauded Starmer’s approach and argued that a more aggressive line will simply alienate the public at a time of high government popularity, Labour leftwingers have been frustrated at the party’s refusal to seize on the crisis as a moment to propose a radical overhaul of the economy and society. Jon Trickett, now relegated to the backbenches from his position of shadow cabinet office minister, says: “The country’s crying out for a longer-term vision. We need to map out a great vision for the kind of new normal that can exist after this pandemic. Perhaps the leadership doesn’t feel now’s the right time to do that.”
Reynolds says those are arguments Labour can make later. For now, the priority is pressing for urgent assistance for struggling households and families. “I’m very sympathetic to UBI, but realistically you’ve got to use the channels we’ve got,” he says. “The fact that we have come out with pragmatic suggestions of how to help people right now, does not take away from the fact that we want and are committed to a full alternative to universal credit: we want to work with people and build a big coalition around that. That approach has been replicated across the shadow cabinet.
Annaliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, has praised the chancellor’s economic rescue schemes but pointed out the gaps in them. And Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, has lauded frontline police officers but demanded more action to protect domestic violence victims. Labour believes this is what the public expects of the official opposition at a time of national crisis. Starmer held the first two of a string of planned “Call Keir” virtual meetings, with voters from Bury and the Tees Valley this week. These meetings, and polling seen by Labour strategists, are telling them the public don’t want to hear knee-jerk criticism of the government. “The approach we’re getting from the public is, ‘All of us need to be together, getting through this,’” said a party source. They also say the public believe the right time to challenge the government’s handling of the outbreak head-on will be after the worst has passed – though Starmer has stepped up his attacks in the past week, telling Johnson the UK had been slow into lockdown, and now risks “falling behind the rest of the world”. The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth – one of the few frontbenchers to remain in the same job when Starmer took over – has been praised by Matt Hancock for his constructive approach; but his frustration with the government’s stance also appeared to bubble over this week.
Ashworth has been calling for the test-and-track approach now being pursued by Hancock for some time – and believes the health secretary should have started much earlier to recruit the necessary army of contact-tracers he has now acknowledged will be needed. “This lockdown is not a strategy in itself to defeat the virus,” Ashworth told the Guardian. “This lockdown buys us time to put in place a strategy. And my big fear is that in the same way they failed to prepare the testing we needed, and they failed to prepare the PPE for frontline staff, it looks like they are failing to prepare the tracing capacity we need.” Most of Starmer’s frontbench team have been in contact with their Conservative opposite numbers, and the shadow cabinet are receiving briefings from relevant civil servants. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, says that while they don’t want to “bombard” the civil service, “it’s our job as an opposition to be constructively critical”. And Reynolds says these private conversations are no substitute for asking a question publicly, in parliament – even virtually.
Boris Johnson briefed Starmer directly this week, as part of what the prime minister claimed was part his effort to “build the biggest possible consensus,” for how to manage the next phase of the crisis. Both sides insist that falls far short of coopting Labour into decision-making, however, with Starmer’s team regarding chatter about a “national government” as a Westminster bubble fantasy.﻿
When Johnson returned to the Downing Street press conference on Thursday, he appeared to reflect Labour’s repeated recent calls for an “exit strategy”, avoiding the phrase repeatedly used by Starmer but promising a “road map” and a “menu of options”. Speaking afterwards, Starmer made clear he felt vindicated. “I think that shows that we were right to challenge on it, and I’m pleased that we’re going to see a plan, we’ll look at it when we see it, but it’s a step in the right direction.” With Corbyn watching from high above him on the backbenches, Starmer used a telling phrase at Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions, to describe how he sees his own approach – and which helps explain his caution. “I try to be careful to stick to the data and the evidence, rather than just coming up with an opinion,” he told Dominic Raab."
2020-05-01T11:46:44Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson is back. But has he changed?,"It was a low-key comeback. After a week in hospital, and two more spent recuperating at Chequers, the prime minister’s official country residence, Boris Johnson arrived at Downing Street last weekend in an inconspicuous Volkswagen mini-van. He slipped inside. There was no victory sign or cheerful wave. For an unprecedented period, the prime minister had been missing. He was either laid low from his coronavirus symptoms, in intensive care in St Thomas’ hospital in Westminster, or recovering from what the tabloids called his “brush with death”. It was clear that few major government decisions had been made in Johnson’s long absence. Now, according to aides, he was “raring to go”; he was ready to “take control” of government affairs and to “bounce back”. The country, not to mention deferential cabinet colleagues, were waiting for some answers. Was Johnson in favour of easing lockdown? When and how might this happen? And were his laissez-faire instincts a thing of the past? There were personal questions, too. Namely, whether Johnson’s experience of grave illness had recast his personality for the better. In the pre-virus days, the serious politician played second fiddle to the crowd-pleasing comedian and columnist. Now, some saw Johnson taking on a new persona befitting our pandemic-shaped age: that of a statesman. On Monday, for instance, the Times reported an unnamed cabinet minister saying his illness “has changed him … He now has an emotional connection to the NHS that you don’t get from anything except a near-death experience.” The early signals, though, were mixed. At 9am on Monday morning Johnson appeared in front of Downing Street. His five-minute speech showed a man labouring to breathe as he spoke. His clothes seemed to hang off him – his appearance and demeanour a physical embodiment of the effects of the infection.
He gave no hint as to when schools and non-essential shops might reopen and some measure of normal life resume. Nor was there acknowledgement – tacit or otherwise – that his time away had clarified his thinking, or made him inclined to choose this moment to “level with the country”, as he has previously promised to do, about the decisions that have been taken, the potential mistakes that have been made over the timing of the lockdown. He swerved around the questions about the lockdown, the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the chaos over testing. Instead, Johnson asked the nation for patience. “I believe we are coming now to the end of the first phase of the conflict”, he said. There seemed to be deliberate echoes here of Churchill’s famous second world war speech about the “end of the beginning”. Johnson offered further flourishes. The disease – as he himself knew – was “an invisible mugger”. Thanks to our collective efforts, Britain had “wrestled it to the ground”.
The phrase didn’t really capture the grim and multitudinous truth. By Monday more than 20,000 people had officially died of the virus – in hospitals, care centres, or in quiet agony at home, surrounded by loved ones. They were not so much mugged as extinguished before their time. By the end of the week the official tally was 27,000-plus, and probably much higher. To his critics, who have included normally loyal supporters in the rightwing media, there are still searching questions about the prime minister’s decisions in late February and March – or lack of them. By some analyses, the UK is on track to have the highest death rate in Europe. Other countries, led by Germany and Denmark, have done much better. Were they less complacent and more organised? Either way, they are now emerging from lockdown. Another moment for Johnson to address these issues might have been prime minister’s questions on Wednesday. He was due for the first time to face up to Sir Keir Starmer, the new Labour leader. But the evening before, Downing Street wouldn’t say whether Johnson planned to turn up, which was odd.There was speculation Johnson might still be somewhat unwell. In fact, something else was going on. On Wednesday morning, Johnson was at his partner Carrie Symonds’ side as she gave birth to a baby boy at an NHS hospital. It was the latest dramatic event in what had been an extraordinary period for Johnson, several lives squashed into one almost: Brexit, Covid-19, and the unparalleled shut-down of national life. A photo taken on the stairs of Downing Street showed a grinning Johnson, back from his fiancee’s bedside. He looks elated and nobody could begrudge the couple their happiness. Well-wishers noted babies change people for the better; cynics pointed out that Johnson has been a father five – or more – times before, and that this arrival might prove a distraction from the tasks ahead. In the nine months since he became PM, Johnson has frequently seemed semi-engaged. Over New Year he had a holiday in the Caribbean. In February he spent 12 days at Chevening, the government’s estate in Kent, missing five Cobra meetings as Covid-19 spread from China. Reportedly he took weekends off. Former colleagues have joked Johnson prefers to do many things badly, rather than one thing well – more of a chairman than a CEO. Downing Street aides say this is wrong. They insist Johnson is devoting his full attention to the coronavirus crisis. One ministerial adviser said he was busier at the end of his time off than was admitted. He asked for submissions on a whole range of issues, not just Covid-19. His time in hospital reignited his desire to take care of the NHS, and to get back to work, the adviser said.
Johnson is now determined to “turn the tide” on the virus by mid-June, officials suggest. In his absence ministers have argued about the right way forward. Johnson is keen to take back control of the political situation, officials stress, and is reportedly annoyed at leaks suggesting the cabinet is split between pro-economy hawks and cautious lockdown doves. So what next? Before falling sick, Johnson could be counted among those who were bullish about the prospect of easing restrictions and returning to business as usual relatively quickly. Multiple sources with knowledge of his thinking say some of that optimism has faded. They says this partly reflects his own experiences in intensive care – but also the changing scientific picture presented to him. “There has been briefing from some close to No 10 against Matt [Hancock]. But the truth is the PM’s position is much closer to Matt’s than those pushing for measures to be lifted. Dom [Raab] has come round to that view as well,” one cabinet source said.
It was Johnson, apparently, who approved the decision to add care home figures to the daily death tally – a risky move towards transparency, given the horrifying numbers involved. And then on Thursday the prime minister appeared for the first time in well over a month at the government’s 5pm press conference. Again, he was breathless. And more hesitant than usual, misreading the figure for deaths. And again, he chose not to address the questions that have been asked of him personally, or his government. So far, neither he, nor anybody in his top team, has wanted to meet the challenge set them by Intisar Chowdhury, the 18-year-old son of an NHS doctor who died with coronavirus. The teenager has asked for an apology, for ministers to “openly acknowledge there have been mistakes in handling this virus.” At the daily briefing, Johnson stressed the allegedly good news. The UK had passed the peak of the disease. It was was on a downward slope. He promised details next week of how lockdown might end. There would be a “roadmap” and a “menu of options”. There was a warning, too. Johnson likened the pandemic to a pleasant European motoring holiday that had got into unexpected difficulty. Britain was driving through a “huge Alpine tunnel”. Ahead were “sunlight and pasture”. It needed to keep control, lest it run into a “second and bigger mountain”. He claimed the UK had avoided the tragedy that had engulfed other places. Asked if his time in hospital had altered him, he said he was “very, very lucky” and paid tribute to the “thousands of people” who had been less fortunate. For the moment, Johnson’s political opponents recognise he is unassailable. His popularity ratings are high. The country, polls suggest, is inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt, at least for now, while the virus is still a threat and the NHS is under great strain.
The new baby will generate further goodwill. There have been gushing headlines from the pro-Boris ringwing media, with more to come when the boy is named, and the first pictures emerge. It is the perfect plotline in a time of gloom. But Johnson will not be able to put off a reckoning forever. The government’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said as much on Thursday when he suggested the country needed to focus on the crisis in hand, and not dwell – for now – on how we got here. Other leaders have emerged from the crisis with their reputations enhanced – Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand, Angela Merkel in Germany, Andrew Cuomo in New York. But they followed a different template: level with the public, admit mistakes, explain the facts. Will Johnson do likewise? There were few indications last week that Johnson is inclined to do so. So far, at least, the new Boris looks remarkably like the old one."
2020-05-01T11:36:00Z,politics,Politics,Brexit 'could impede coronavirus contact tracing on island of Ireland',"Brexit could put at risk the contact tracing of coronavirus patients on the island of Ireland if the UK crashes out of the EU without a trade deal at the end of the year, the health minister in the Northern Ireland assembly has conceded. Contact tracing in the region is expected to resume next week but may face challenges if the virus, as is probable, continues to threaten communities beyond the 31 December deadline for a Brexit trade deal, local politicians have said.
The tracing of number plates, flight passenger lists and coronavirus test results could become impossible unless the UK agrees a deal on its future relationship with the EU that includes security and data-sharing arrangements. “What detail, what level of information we share [in 2021] has still to be worked out,” said Robin Swann, Stormont’s health minister.
Data shared between authorities in Belfast and Dublin helped in February to trace passengers on a plane that landed in Dublin airport who may have had contact with a resident who went on to Northern Ireland and later tested positive for coronavirus. The Social Democrat and Labour party assembly member Matthew O’Tooleasked Swann if this would continue beyond December in the absence of a trade deal or extension to the transition period. “We will probably still be contact tracing people, we will still be moving from Dundalk to Newry and Buncrana to Derry,” said O’Toole in reference to border towns. “Is there a risk that if we leave the transition period without a deal and there is legal uncertainty around our information governance framework that would put contact tracing particularly in border areas into risk?” Swann replied that it had been flagged as an issue under Brexit’s Operation Yellowhammer contingency planning but that no action could be taken until they knew what shape Brexit would take. “This is new to this island, this is new to the UK, this is new to Europe and we look at how we actually start to do this level of contact tracing so when it comes to legalities, who holds the information? Is it held on your phone, is it held in a central database? That all has to be [worked out] at this point of time,” he told the Stormont assembly.
“Let’s get it up and running and we will work round the rest of it when we get to the end of the year and we see where we are in regards to Brexit.” Swann’s comments come as the European commission told the UK that time was short to implement the Northern Ireland protocol that Boris Johnson included in the withdrawal agreement in January. A technical note issued by Brussels put flesh on the bones of the protocol and served as a reminder of the scale of the challenge facing businesses and now health authorities in the face of a national health emergency.
After the first meeting of the specialised committee of EU and UK officials tasked with implementing the Northern Ireland rules, the commission said the exchanges “now urgently need to be followed up by tangible measures”. Andrew McCormick, a senior official from the Northern Ireland civil service, was present at the meeting."
2020-04-30T19:30:52Z,politics,Politics,Breathless Boris is left floundering as he faces foe he can't outbluster | John Crace,"Boris Johnson has every right to sound knackered. It’s little more than a couple of weeks since he came out of intensive care and his partner has just given birth to a baby boy. But sounding breathless before he had even gasped out his opening sentence at his first Downing Street press conference since falling ill with the coronavirus probably wasn’t the commanding, reassuring presence he had hoped to convey. The Boss may be back, but the man who longed to be the new Churchill isn’t even the old Boris. The upbeat ebullience and jingoism no longer comes naturally. He can still come out with the same words, but he can no longer even bring himself to believe them. For the first time in his life, there are signs of self-doubt. When he looks in the mirror, he now sees his reflection beginning to fragment. His persona that has been carefully constructed over 55 years to protect himself from the pain of being himself is falling apart. Yet still he can’t quite access the humility that might go some way to healing himself. Not that Boris didn’t give it his best shot at papering over the cracks, but it cost him dear. By the end of the press conference he was just two pinprick, bloodshot eyes peeping out of an ashen-white face. If he really feels the need to get back to work so soon, then he can’t have much faith in the rest of his cabinet. There again, that’s one area where you can’t really fault his judgment. “I’m not going to minimise the lack of personal protective equipment or the failure to expedite testing,” he said. Before proceeding to do just that. The lack of PPE and adequate testing – today was the day we were supposed to have reached 100,000 daily tests – have been two of the leading factors in the UK’s mortality rate, but according to Boris the government hadn’t put a foot wrong. The lack of an apology becomes more insulting by the day to the families of the nearly 27,000 people who have died. It appears that the only people in the entire country not to have heard of the 2016 Exercise Cygnus, that highlighted the risks of a pandemic, are the entire government frontbench. Rejoice, rejoice. Sunlight was visible. We had avoided the worst-case scenario of 500,000 dead by burrowing under the alpine mountain. Boris appeared to have both forgotten that we were already well past the 20,000 “best-case result” of his chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, and that – even allowing for statistical variations – the UK had a fatality rate significantly higher than that of Germany or South Korea and might even have the worst record of any country in Europe. The line that the government did the right things at the right time becomes ever more untenable. What can’t be admitted is that Boris effectively took a 10-day holiday in March, at a time when he could have done more to protect the country. Seldom has so much been owed by so few to so many. Boris then breezed on to the R rate – AKA the reproduction rate. Here satire nearly died. For as scientists struggle to pin down the UK’s R rate to between 0.6 and 0.9, no one has the first idea of Boris’s own reproduction rate. We know its current level is at least six – though even Boris doesn’t appear to know if it’s more – and with every likelihood of adding to the score in the years ahead. If Boris were a virus he would be deadly. On and on he bumbled. We would have to wait until some time next week for the government to make it clear it still had no real plan for ending lockdown. Things were definitely getting better but no one had a clue how to ease things while ensuring R remained lower than one. Even Vallance and England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, couldn’t help Boris out with that one. The only certainty was more uncertainty. The questions only revealed how little everyone really knew, as Boris had no clear answers to anything. He couldn’t say anything on tourism to Cornwall – “there will be more information later” – and his suggestion that people with mental health issues should call NHS helplines rang hollow as successive Tory governments have cut mental health provision to a bare minimum. Even if you’re really desperate, you’re lucky to get an appointment inside six months these days. An embarrassed Whitty eventually had to intervene and point people in the direction of mental health charities if they needed urgent help. Otherwise, there was just more of the same. The scientists urging caution while Boris talked big about the economy bouncing back, avoiding the second peak and enforcing the wearing of face masks which only a month ago he had said were a waste of time. But deep down, Boris knows he’s met his match. Up till now, he’s never found a situation in his life which he couldn’t bluster his way out of. Now he’s come up against a power greater than himself; coronavirus is so far immune to almost everything. In a straight contest between coronavirus and bullshit, the coronavirus wins every time."

2020-04-30T17:40:26Z,politics,Politics,"Labour should not shy away from patriotism, says Starmer","Labour must wholeheartedly embrace patriotism to win back support, the new leader Keir Starmer has said as he faced ex-Labour voters as part of a virtual tour of the country. He said the Labour movement and patriotism were “two sides of the same coin” and the party should not shy away from displaying national pride. During a video call with people in Bury, there was criticism from one ex-voter who said he had been made to feel his support for the monarchy, Brexit and even waving the union jack was tantamount to racist behaviour.
Starmer said: “I’m really proud of my country and I wouldn’t be leader of the Labour party if I wasn’t patriotic,” adding that he has felt this even more strongly during the Covid-19 response. “What I desperately want for our country is for our country to get better. In the Labour party we should be proud of being patriotic. We’re all working, knocking on doors in the rain or shine, to try to put in place a team that can go into government to improve the country we live in because we love the country we live in. “I don’t think we should shy away from that. That is a really good thing to be proud of, and [to] want your country to be the best it possibly can be,” he said. The former leader Jeremy Corbyn was regularly criticised for a perceived lack of patriotism owing to some of the international causes he supported and past comments that he would prefer an elected head of state. Both Bury North, which had been Labour, and Bury South, which had been Labour and then independent, switched to Conservative at the last general election as part of the sweeping Labour losses in the north of England. Around 120 people from Bury tuned in to the video call. A call with people in Tees Valley – another home of former “red wall” seats – was planned for Thursday night. Next week Starmer will take calls from the public in Scotland. The “Call Keir” initiative has been put into action after Starmer’s plan to spend his first months in charge visiting seats Labour has lost had to be called off because of coronavirus. In a question on how he would tackle “anti-patriotism”, Starmer was also asked to condemn the former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott for her comments on Brexit supporters, and Clive Lewis MP for saying the Brexit campaign had “racism at its heart”. Abbott was reported as saying in 2016, at a fringe meeting at the Labour party conference, that people who voted for Brexit wanted “less foreign-looking people on their streets” and she raised repeatedly the rise in hate crime after the referendum. Starmer said he thought the hate crime statistics were of justifiable concern. “The vast majority of people who voted leave – nothing to do with racism at all and I don’t think Brexit was really about that,” he said. “I was concerned about the spike in hate crime that happened at the same time, and that we do need to take very seriously. Although it may be a very, very small element, and I don’t think the EU is really to do with that at all. But there are racist comments and incidents that are said and done and there has been hate crime out there and we need to be very firm about tackling that.”"
2020-04-30T17:06:05Z,politics,Politics,Johnson promises plan next week for return to schools and work,"Boris Johnson promised to set out next week how schools and workplaces could safely reopen once lockdown restrictions were eased, as he claimed the UK was past the peak of the coronavirus outbreak. Despite announcing an increase of 674 in the death toll of the virus, taking it to a total of 26,771, the prime minister suggested the worst was over. “I can confirm today for the first time that we are past the peak of this disease. We are past the peak and we are on the downward slope,” he said, three days after returning to work as he recovers from Covid-19 himself. Presenting his first Downing Street press conference since being discharged from hospital, the prime minister at times appeared breathless. He robustly defended his government’s handling of the outbreak, after a slew of criticism during his absence from the political frontline. “We’re learning lessons every day – but I do think that, broadly speaking, we did the right thing at the right time,” he said. Responding to the argument that a more stringent lockdown should have been imposed sooner, he said: “Don’t forget, it’s a very very demanding thing to ask a population to do – very tough – and so I think it was completely right to make our period of lockdown coincide as far as possible with the peak of the epidemic.” Johnson announced that the government would next week publish what he called a “comprehensive plan” setting out “how we can continue to suppress the disease and at the same time restart the economy”. However, he stressed any changes would only be enacted once the government was confident the outbreak was under control. “What you are going to get next week is really a road map, a menu of options. The dates and times of each individual measure will be very much driven by where we are in the epidemic, what the data is really saying and we are getting in a lot more data every day now and in the course of the next few days.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, welcomed the prime minister’s statement, after repeatedly calling on the government to set out its “exit strategy” – though Johnson declined to use that precise phrase. “I’ve been calling on the prime minister to have a plan for the next stage and exit strategy,” Starmer said. “We’ve been pushing hard on that in the last week or two. The prime minister has now said he’s going to have a plan next week. So I think that shows that we were right to challenge on it, and I’m pleased that we’re going to see a plan. We’ll look at it when we see it, but it’s a step in the right direction.” The government’s five tests for relaxing lockdown restrictions include the availability of adequate PPE and testing, and a sustained fall in the death rate. But the prime minister laid particular emphasis on R, the reproduction number for the virus, measured as the average number of people each sufferer infects. The target is to keep the R rate of transmission below 1, but even small reductions in the rate can help avoid thousands of new infections a day. At the moment, the government’s scientific advisers believe it is between 0.6 and 0.9. England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, urged caution, saying: “As soon as R goes over one, then you restart exponential growth – it may be slow if it is just over one, it may be a lot faster if it goes a lot above one – but exponential growth restarts and, sooner or later – and the higher it is, the sooner it is – the NHS will go back to the risk of being overwhelmed and the number of cases will go up.” One source close to Downing Street said the government was also reluctant to lift the lockdown until the number of new daily infections was lower than around 5,000 per day – the measure which was used by Germany to determine when to ease social distancing. However, the UK is quite some way off that goal. The official figures show at least 6,000 people tested positive on Wednesday, but the real number is likely to be much higher than that because many cases in the community are not being tested. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told the Scottish public on Wednesday it was highly unlikely that there would be a loosening of lockdown restrictions next week. “It is likely by the time we get to this time next week, which is the 7 May review day, it will not be possible in any meaningful way to lift these restrictions,” she said. “We have worked very hard to bring down the transmission rate of the virus and we are definitely seeing results from those efforts. But our progress against the virus is too fragile for us to let up.” In Whitehall, ministers have been scrambling to draw up plans for the next phase of the crisis, which Johnson’s deputy, Dominic Raab, has described as a “new normal”, rather than a return to the pre-lockdown life.
Johnson said for the first time on Thursdaythat this could include the public being advised to wear face masks. Asked about the issue, the prime minister said: “I do think face masks will be useful, both for epidemiological reasons, and to give people the confidence that it is safe to go back to work.” His remarks contradicted the stance of some cabinet colleagues. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said earlier this week there was only “weak science” supporting the use of face masks. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, warned on Wednesday they might tempt people to behave in a “cavalier” manner. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, welcomed the government’s apparent change of heart, saying: “I am pleased that the prime minister has said that non-medical face coverings will play an important role as we eventually look to lift lockdown restrictions. This is something I and others have been pushing the government to change the guidance on.” Downing Street believes more people could safely return to work even before the lockdown is formally lifted, if distancing measures are complied with. Some manufacturers, including the car maker Rolls-Royce, have restarted production lines – and the DIY chain B&Q announced on Wednesday that it would reopen its stores. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been keen to see more of the economy reopen as soon as it is safe to do so. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that the unprecedented measures introduced to help firms and households weather the crisis will cost £104bn in this financial year. Asked whether meeting the costs would mean a fresh round of austerity when the outbreak was over, Johnson insisted it would not, saying: “That will certainly not be part of our approach.” “I think the economy will want to bounce back strongly. I think that this government will want to encourage that bounceback in all kinds of ways,” he said. In preparation for an easing of lockdown restrictions, the business secretary, Alok Sharma, is drawing up guidance for safe working in different types of setting. Business groups and unions are expecting to see a first draft of this weekend.
The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has been examining plans for what he has called a “phased” reopening of schools. Testing for coronavirus has increased significantly in recent days as eligibility has been extended to new groups, with 81,611 tests carried out on Wednesday, according to the Department of Health and Social Care, although only 54,575 individuals were tested because of the number of repeated tests on the same people. Testing capacity stood at around 90,000. It will not be clear until Friday afternoon whether Hancock has met his self-imposed target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April."
2020-04-30T14:47:47Z,politics,Politics,Fears Brexit talks could collapse in June but UK still optimistic,"The UK is still optimistic about striking a trade deal with the EU but has warned that talks could collapse in June unless Brussels abandons its demands for a common fisheries policy and a level playing field, a source close to the UK’s negotiating team has said. The source said only “limited progress in bridging the gaps between us” had been made at last week’s talks, but there was “confidence that progress can be made quite quickly”. The two sides will have to come closer to an agreement before a high-level meeting between ministers planned for June if the UK is to stay at the negotiating table. Boris Johnson is expected to take a more active role in trying to help unblock talks if that date approaches with no breakthrough. The source close to the UK’s negotiating team said last week’s talks, conducted by video conference, worked well but it was more difficult to build up a personal rapport when communicating remotely.
He said he was “quite positive” about the probability of a trade deal before the end of the year, when the UK’s transition period ends, echoing the prediction of Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, that the chances of a deal were “definitely better than two to one”. Responding to those claims about the chances of a Brexit deal, an EU diplomat said the UK was taking a high-stakes gamble. “Everybody knows that the UK is the world of betting men, but betting alone won’t result in a trade agreement. The continent is as engulfed by Covid as the UK, so I wouldn’t bank on leaders having much time to cater to British fancy,” the diplomat said. “Recovery comes first and last, and a trade deal with the UK is of course a necessary element, but not one that needs to be addressed urgently.” A second EU diplomat said: “If No 10 doesn’t change its negotiating approach, we will very likely be looking at a no-deal scenario. So we take this statement [on the positive chances of a deal by Michael Gove] as a welcome sign that the UK will change its negotiating stance and start talking on the basis of the joint political declaration,” the document agreed between the EU and Boris Johnson last October. However, the UK source said: “What is slowing us up is the EU’s insistence on extra provision, notably the level playing field area, aspects of governance and, of course, there is no meeting of minds on fisheries. If they continue to insist on their position on a so-called level playing field, and on continuing the common fisheries policy, for example, we are never going to accept that. “Draw your own conclusion from that, but I hope they will move on. There are some fundamentals that we are not going to change, we are not going to move on, because not so much that they are negotiation positions as they are what an independent state does.” He added: “I am confident we will get over that … but probably a bit more noise has to happen before we get to that point.” Johnson has been facing calls to consider asking for an extension to the transition period to avoid the UK having to trade on World Trade Organization terms with the EU from the end of the year. However, No 10 has said an extension is not up for negotiation.
The UK source also said it was “still entirely possible to conclude negotiations on the timetable that has been outlined”. EU officials do not share London’s optimism. Last week the bloc’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, accused the UK government of running down the clock by “slow[ing] down discussions on important areas”. An EU source said: “We are really not making any progress,” describing the latest series of talks as “a standstill round”. While this limited progress would be unsurprising in “normal” trade talks, the accelerated timetable and political attention being consumed by coronavirus has raised questions in Brussels about striking a deal by the end of the year. “If we had all the time in the world, I really wouldn’t be worried about it,” said the source. “But we are already [almost] into May now. Ratification is going to be extremely complex at the end of the year, so we need more time. We can’t plan for the speedy ratification we were hoping for, for many reasons, and everyone is distracted.” Brussels officials also perceive a lack of top-level political engagement in the negotiations. The EU has accused Johnson of backsliding on promises to uphold common standards on the environment, health and workers’ rights – the so-called level playing field. Under pressure from coastal member states such as France, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands, Barnier has also insisted there will be no trade deal without an agreement on fishing rights. Meanwhile in Northern Ireland, the EU-UK specialised committee for the region met for the first time, on Thursday. The DUP MP Ian Paisley accused the group of being “stuffed with civil servants” and bureaucrats. He said: “They are not getting the nitty gritty of business needs.” The committee will be critical to the future of Northern Ireland as it has the mandate to work out and recommend what checks should be in place in the Irish Sea when the transition period ends in January. Industry leaders in the region warned that Brexit checks would be imposed on businesses struggling for survival in the Covid crisis, and there was a need for the government to be transparent and straight with them. Aodhán Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said there could be “no hail Mary pass, no gentleman’s agreement” on Brexit checks and the detail needed to be “nailed down” soon to give businesses any chance to prepare."
2020-04-30T11:20:44Z,politics,Politics,UK Border Force officials ordered not to routinely wear masks,"Border Force officials carrying out passport and customs checks are being prevented from wearing face masks at work, staff claim, leaving them fearful that they must choose between their health or being disciplined. An order prohibiting officials from routinely wearing masks is said to have been given on 20 April. Some local managers had until then allowed staff to bring in and use their own protection. Two Border Force officials have died after contracting coronavirus in recent weeks. Only staff dealing with people who show symptoms of the virus or searching those clandestinely entering the country are provided with face masks. Managers have been told to ask staff to remove their masks in any other work situation, the Guardian understands. The Home Office did not deny the claim when it was put to a spokesman. The Immigration Services Union, representing officials working in the UK, Paris, Brussels, Lille, Calais, Dunkirk, Coquelles and Amsterdam, has advised its members to defy the Home Office, to which the Border Force answers. The force operates at air and sea ports and Eurotunnel and Eurostar junctions. In a circular sent to members on 25 April, the union writes: “We know many of you feel strongly that you should be able to wear face masks routinely at work in order to protect yourself and others from Covid-19 infections. We are therefore very worried that Border Force are preventing you from wearing your own face masks at work and in places threatening you with disciplinary action if you do try to wear a mask. “To say the least, this seems to us an aggressive and unreasonable attitude to take towards staff with genuine welfare concerns.” The union says it will support members who face issues with managers for wearing masks and “will not hesitate to bring employment tribunal actions”. It adds: “We do think it would be better for the Home Office to make standard provision for all, of course. However, they show no signs of doing this and we cannot ask members who are now anxious to wait for government procurement. If members have masks and wish to wear them, then they should. People should not be prevented from protecting themselves and others.” The union says the Employments Rights Act gives officials the right to protect themselves at work. “Therefore if you are persuaded on the balance of the scientific/public health evidence that you should bring a face mask to work and wear it, then you should do just that. We wish we could reassure that you will not face resistance from senior Border Force leaders. But we cannot.” UK government sources said staff bringing in masks to work would not face disciplinary action but managers would explain the current scientific advice to those concerned by the policy. Public Health England (PHE) currently recommends face masks for the NHS and in social care settings but does not advise healthy people to wear them outside. This week, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announced new guidance recommending that the Scottish public should wear face masks in enclosed spaces where physical distancing was difficult to achieve, for example while shopping or using public transport.
The British Medical Association has called on ministers to make wearing masks in public compulsory. Critics have accused the government of being slow to roll out the general use of masks for fear of exacerbating a shortage in the healthcare system. The union has raised the issue of a lack of protective equipment for Border Force staff with the home affairs select committee, which is preparing to hold a short inquiry into the government’s pandemic preparedness. A Home Office spokesman said: “The safety of the public and our staff is of the utmost importance. All guidance to staff on the use of personal protective equipment is based upon Public Health England’s guidance. All Border Force staff have all the necessary protective clothing and equipment available as per the PHE guidance for when they are in close contact with anyone displaying symptoms.”"
2020-04-29T20:28:13Z,politics,Politics,GMB union launch inquiry into claims against Tim Roache,"The former head of one of the UK’s biggest unions, who resigned unexpectedly on Tuesday, is at the centre of an internal investigation into his personal conduct. A statement from GMB union on Wednesday said officials have launched an inquiry into anonymous claims made against Tim Roache, who stood down just months after being re-elected as general secretary. The development has left the union, which represents 600,000 workers including ambulance drivers and manufacturing staff, in turmoil. Following a number of questions from the media regarding circulated allegations about Roache’s conduct, the statement said: “GMB received an anonymous letter, last Wednesday, in which a number of allegations have been made about Tim’s conduct whilst he held the office of general secretary. “An investigation has been launched and it is not appropriate to comment further pending the outcome of that investigation. “Complaints which are brought to our attention will be dealt with appropriately in line with our policies and procedures and with appropriate regard to fairness and sensitivity.” The statement said Roache had been diagnosed some years ago with ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome, and had been advised to refrain from work. “Having been signed off by medical professionals earlier this week, Tim was advised to refrain completely from work – and has now taken the difficult decision to stand down from the role permanently, indicating that he does not feel mentally or physically able to continue to lead our union,” it read. The decision seemed to have coincided with a campaign for him to be suspended from office. Sources close to the union said a letter had been sent to the union’s president Barbara Plant which made detailed, personal allegations against Roache. Some claims have also been circulated on social media, the source said. “They are serious claims and are going to be investigated properly,” a source said. Roache wielded considerable influence within the union movement, given that the GMB is one of the biggest donors to the Labour party. It has given more than £12m to the party over the past five years, according to Electoral Commission records. He was often seen as a critic of Jeremy Corbyn. In 2016 the GMB supported Owen Smith in his leadership challenge. This year, the union backed Lisa Nandy, who came third — behind Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long Bailey — and is now the shadow foreign secretary. Roache was first elected as GMB leader in 2015 and was re-elected in 2019. The union said that John Phillips, its regional secretary for Wales and the South West, has been appointed as acting general secretary until a replacement for Roache is elected. Earlier on Wednesday, a spokesman for Keir Starmer declined an offer to back Roache following his resignation. Roache has been approached for comment."
2020-04-29T18:57:48Z,politics,Politics,'Sorry we didn’t leave the cot!': politicians cheer PM and Symonds,"It’s only been three weeks since Boris Johnson praised the NHS for saving for his life, but on Wednesday the prime minister was back in hospital with another good reason to thank the health service – the safe delivery of a baby boy. His partner, Carrie Symonds, gave birth at an NHS hospital in London in the early hours, with a spokesman for the couple saying both mother and son were doing well. Johnson was present throughout the birth of the boy, who may have arrived some weeks early given that Symonds was due in “early summer”. Although Johnson missed prime minister’s questions at noon on Wednesday, he was already back at his desk in Downing Street by early afternoon and taking part in a phone call with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. Having taken three weeks off to be treated for and recuperate from coronavirus, it is understood Johnson is determined to be present in Downing Street for the crucial decisions that need to be taken in the coming weeks on exiting the lockdown. He had been planning to take two weeks of paternity leave, but a spokesman said this has been delayed until later in the year – although new fathers must officially take it within 56 days of a birth. Johnson is also keen to preserve privacy around the birth of his son. He has four children with his estranged second wife, Marina Wheeler – Lara Lettice, 26, Milo Arthur, 24, Cassia Peaches, 22, and Theodore Apollo, 20 – as well as another child with the art consultant Helen Macintyre. Beyond that, he has always declined to say how many sons and daughters he has overall.
“The prime minister is delighted by the birth of his baby son and I’m not going to comment on his other children,” the press secretary said. The spokesman would not name the hospital that delivered the baby, the time of arrival, or birth weight. He also declined to say whether it was a premature birth or whether the delivery was a medical emergency. The couple have not yet released a name but bookmakers were taking the most bets on Thomas, George, Winston, Wilfred, Alexander, James and Matthew. The birth was announced shortly before 10am on Wednesday by a spokeswoman for the couple. She said: “The prime minister and Ms Symonds are thrilled to announce the birth of a healthy baby boy at a London hospital earlier this morning. Both mother and baby are doing very well. “The PM and Ms Symonds would like to thank the fantastic NHS maternity team.” Politicians across the spectrum offered their congratulations. Starmer offered his congratulations to Johnson and Symonds on Twitter, calling the announcement “wonderful news”.
The health secretary, Matt Hancock, tweeted that he was “thrilled” for the couple. “Wonderful to have a moment of unalloyed joy!” he said.
The Queen also sent a private message of good wishes to Johnson and Symonds to congratulate them, Buckingham Palace said. The monarch and the prime minister later spoke on Wednesday evening for their weekly audience. The prime minister’s father, Stanley Johnson, said he was “absolutely delighted” and “thrilled” by the birth of his grandson. David Cameron, who was in Downing Street while Johnson was mayor of London, sent his “heartfelt congratulations”, adding: “Sorry we didn’t leave the cot – but the climbing frame should still be in the garden!”
Symonds, 32, used to work as the Conservative party’s head of communications but now focuses on environmental and marine conservation issues. She moved into Downing Street with Johnson when he became prime minister and they are the first unmarried couple to live there. The couple’s new son follows a recent tradition of babies in No 10 with David Cameron’s wife, Samantha, giving birth to their daughter Florence in 2010, and Cherie Blair giving birth to the Blairs’ fourth child, Leo, in 2000."
2020-04-29T18:02:33Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: death toll in hospitals, care homes and community at 26,097 – as it happened","A total of 26,097 patients had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Tuesday, Public Health England said. It was the first time the daily death toll figures took into account deaths in care homes and the community as well as those in hospitals between 2 March and 28 April. It marked an increase of 3,811 on the previous figure. Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds announced the birth of a healthy baby boy at a London hospital on Wednesday morning. With offers of congratulations coming in from across the political spectrum and from world leaders, Downing Street confirmed the PM will take paternity leave later in the year, rather than now. He spoke with the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer about the coronavirus response this afternoon. No 10 declined to say whether the baby was born prematurely nor to disclose any further details about the birth. The UK will fall behind other countries if it doesnâ€™t publish an exit plan soon, Sir Keir Starmer told Dominic Raab during PMQs. Starmer pointed to countries including France, Germany, New Zealand, Scotland and Wales, which deal with issues including reopening schools and some businesses. Starmer said that â€œdelay risks not only falling behind other countries, but also the successful four-nation approach so farâ€�. Schools are expected to reopen â€œin a phased mannerâ€�, Gavin Williamson said. The education secretary said he could not give a date but told MPs that Sage is looking at how a phased reopening of schools could work in line with the scientific advice. More migrant health and care workers on the frontline will be automatically granted free visa extensions, the Home Office confirmed. As well as doctors, nurses and paramedics, the extension will now apply to midwives, radiographers, social workers and pharmacists. Family members and dependents of healthcare workers who die as a result of contracting the virus will also be offered immediate indefinite leave to remain. Air passenger numbers are down 99% compared with a year ago, the home secretary said. Priti Patel told MPs that testing was not taking place at the border, a decision based on advice from Sage, which maintained such measures would have â€œa negligible impactâ€�. And the government insisted it was still aiming to achieve 100,000 tests per day by the end of Thursday (tomorrow). The PMâ€™s spokesman told the lobby briefing that 43,563 coronavirus tests were provided in the 24 hours to 9am yesterday and that there was capacity for 73,400 tests to be carried out. As ever, thank you to everybody who got in touch throughout the day with a stories and suggestions, and to all of you reading along. If you would like to continue to follow the Guardianâ€™s coverage of the pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture."
2020-04-29T17:50:56Z,politics,Politics,Raab is left hankering for Daddy as Keir kills him with kindness | John Crace,"It’s been quite a six months for Boris Johnson. In rough chronological order – the prime minister’s timelines have always had a tendency to get messy – he has won a general election, taken the UK out of the EU, acquired a dog, finalised a divorce, got engaged to Carrie Symonds, announced they were expecting a baby together, taken 10 days’ holiday during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, been admitted to the intensive care unit at St Thomas’ with Covid-19 and become a father again. Just how many children Boris now has is anyone’s guess. Fair to say that the arrival of the latest baby boy caught everyone on the hop, as the official due date had been given as early summer less than a couple of months ago. Even Downing Street seemed wrongfooted by the news, having spent most of Tuesday afternoon and half of Wednesday morning refusing to say whether Boris was sufficiently recovered from his illness to take prime minister’s questions. A straightforward, “Carrie’s having the baby” would have been more than enough for most hacks. As it was, the birth took place amid levels of secrecy not even granted to the royal family. Just a short announcement that the mother and baby were both healthy and that Boris had been present throughout the birth. However, paternity leave may have to be put on hold indefinitely while the government tries to make a better fist of dealing with the pandemic than it has so far. So, after the obligatory expressions of good wishes towards Boris and Carrie, PMQs turned into a re-run of last week’s encounter between the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and the stand-in prime minister, Dominic Raab. With much the same result as last time. As you would expect when a top QC finds himself up against a rather out-of-his-depth country conveyancing solicitor. Starmer doesn’t just beat his opponents with his forensic intelligence – it’s always helpful to have a party leader who can hold more than one thought in his head at any one time – but with politeness. The nicer he is being to you, the more trouble you know you are in. Even a shouty, ranty Keir might have been difficult for Raab to see off, given the government’s record on handling the coronavirus. But against a Keir who is the epitome of icy calm with the total mastery of his brief, he had no chance. First up, Dom was asked to explain Boris’s use of the phrase “our apparent success” in his return to Downing Street statement on Monday. Our mortality rates had already cruised past the chief scientific adviser’s hoped-for maximum of 20,000 deaths and the UK was still in lockdown from the first wave of the disease. By what criteria could that be judged an apparent success? A bead of sweat formed on Raab’s forehead. It was bad enough having to deal with his own fuck-ups, let alone those made by his boss. So he just mumbled something about how things could have been worse – hell, we could all have died – and then made the classic error of insisting it was far too early to make international comparisons. If the UK had the death rates per head of population of Germany and South Korea we would be shouting about it from the rooftops on a daily basis. And rightly so. From there on, Dom was firmly on the back foot as time and again Keir killed him with kindness. Starmer so, so wanted to be supportive in a time of crisis but he was just struggling with one or two little things. Like why the differential between testing capacity and demand, when there so clearly was excess demand. No, he wasn’t trying to score political points, he was merely echoing the concerns of the head of the Royal College of Physicians. And while he had Raab’s attention, could he just follow the lead of almost every other country and give a hint – a little hintlet even – of what the government’s exit strategy might be? Dom couldn’t. This was all well above his pay grade. He shouldn’t be carrying the can for all this. Next time Boris had a child someone else could take over. Things didn’t much improve when the SNP’s Ian Blackford wondered why the Conservatives were so dead set on leaving the EU at the end of the year at a time when the economy might have tanked completely? Even Raab could see it was a completely ludicrous idea and his face crumpled. Normally at times of stress, Dom merely goes full, mainlined-steroids psycho. Determined to out-macho and out-anger his opponents. Now there was something almost childlike about him as his carapace cracked. His vulnerability was almost painful to watch. He had done his best, but it hadn’t been nearly good enough. He was the little boy, out of his depth, who just wanted his Daddy. It was just unfortunate that his Daddy was off with his latest son. His only light relief was two questions about garden centres. Who knew the National Union for Garden Centres was so well represented on the Tory benches?"
2020-04-29T16:21:38Z,politics,Politics,Johnson's baby marks new chapter in PM's very public private life,"It is hard to imagine any British prime minister has been through such a rollercoaster of personal emotion in the space of four months as Boris Johnson. Only a month ago the prime minister was in a hospital ward wondering whether the coronavirus that continued to grip his lungs would mean that he would die in office only three months after securing a resounding personal mandate from a Brexit-weary electorate.
If things had gone a different way in St Thomas’ hospital, to use Johnson’s own phrase, he would indeed have died in public office, probably the most famous of the 218,000 victims of coronavirus worldwide. Now a month later, and possibly many weeks before he or his fiancee Carrie Symonds had expected, he was rushed back to hospital, but to see the delivery of his child. Symonds is herself only just recovering from the same virus.
No date can yet be set for their summer wedding, the first involving a serving prime minister since 1822, as no date has been set by the prime minister to allow large gatherings to go ahead. If all this seems like an overblown episode of a very modern family soap opera, and somewhat distracting in the midst of the biggest shock to the British economy since the second world war, do not forget that the final terms of his disputed divorce settlement with Marina Wheeler have only just been sorted. The bruised emotions of his children from previous relationships also need tending to. Many previous prime ministers have had overcrowded messy private lives, but rarely has the professional and personal plate of a British prime minister been piled so high. This is match, hatch and near dispatch on steroids. But it is not as if Downing Street has not in the recent past coped with the tiny patter of prime ministerial offspring. A consequence of the youthfulness of contemporary British politicians is that three of the four most recent prime ministers, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron, all had young children bouncing in the Downing Street rose garden. Blair arrived in No 10 with three children already in tow, and an established skill at using his family to project an image of modern masculinity. In Parent magazine in 1996, one of innumerable such personal interviews, the strapline read: “Being a dad is harder than being a politician.”
When he discovered in office that his wife, Cherie, was pregnant for a fourth time, Blair’s reaction, according to his communications adviser Alastair Campbell, was a mixture of horror, pleasure and disbelief. “Thank God, I am Christian. It allows me to think there is a reason,” he told Campbell. When the newspapers were told Blair was to be a father and this was the first baby born to a serving prime minister since Lord John Russell in 1849, “money could not buy the publicity we are getting”, Campbell gushed. Campbell had been worried the news would be greeted with cynicism, or even alarm at the potential distraction. On the day of Leo’s birth, Blair appeared on the steps of Downing Street with a mug decorated with a picture of his older children. But he also reassured an adjusting public that he would get his work-life priorities right. “I would be kidding you if I was to say: ‘for x period of time I’m not going to pick up the phone, I’m not going to talk to anyone, if there’s a crisis in the country or the world that I’m not going to be interested. That’s ridiculous. You can’t do that in my job. The important thing is to help Cherie and the baby. I will, obviously, try as much as possible to cut down in that period what I’m doing. But I have to run the country. That still has to go on.” Those who know him best say one of Blair’s special skills is his ability to compartmentalise. One minute he is negotiating the resignation of a Welsh secretary caught in a sex scandal, the next he is gladhanding at a diplomatic reception, and then he is upstairs in the flat discussing his children’s biology homework. The great aspiration is normality. Protecting the children physically from the media is merely a matter taking them out the back to school. It requires passing a few offices, but is hardly intrusive. Protecting them mentally is harder. By contrast Gordon Brown, who in the Treasury had introduced two weeks’ paid paternity leave and became a father at the age of 50, was reluctant to merge his public persona and private life. That is in part a function of tragedy: his first child, Jennifer, died 10 days after birth. But Treasury civil servants remember a happy integration in private, as they stepped over wooden train tracks in his flat discussing the go-ahead for high-speed rail. The more Brown’s spin doctors sought to deploy his family life to humanise his dour image, the more determined he became to protect his children’s privacy. Notoriously driven, private and dissatisfied, Brown just found it near impossible to switch off work, and never warmed to celebrity modern fatherhood. If he mentioned fatherhood in often torturous personal interviews it was often to mention his own father. Reflecting on what parenting had done to him seemed a painful act of sharing.
It was a Conservative, David Cameron, who perfected the image of modern fatherhood inside No 10. At his first Tory conference as leader in 2006, his heavily pregnant wife appeared on stage with him as he patted her stomach. Later, three months after forming a coalition government in 2010, his daughter Florence was born. Cameron never shied away from talking about the influence of his children, including in his speeches, and, without displaying them, never hid them away, allowing them to attend middle-rank receptions, and doing his best to integrate them into an all-consuming life.
On a book tour for his memoir, For the Record, Cameron said Florence, who was only five when the family left Downing Street in 2016, had hardly been scarred by the glare of life in No 10. He told the Cheltenham literature festival that his daughter had asked him only last summer: “Daddy, is it true, were you actually the prime minister?” If Johnson’s latest offspring can end his period in No 10 as ignorant of his father’s occupation, he, and his parents will have done well."
2020-04-29T15:10:30Z,politics,Politics,Brussels and UK at odds over proposed EU office in Belfast,"Brussels and UK officials will clash over the increasingly fraught question of whether the European Union can open an office in Belfast. At the inaugural meeting on Thursday of a special committee of officials charged with enforcing a de facto Irish Sea border, the European commission is expected to press the case to open “a technical office” in Belfast, three days after the government rejected an EU “mini-embassy” in the Northern Irish capital. The EU is refusing to drop the issue, amid fears Boris Johnson’s government could renege on the Brexit withdrawal agreement that requires Northern Ireland to follow EU single market and customs rules. The British government, which says it is fully committed to the agreement, argues an EU office is not necessary and would sow division in Northern Irish politics. A narrow majority of Northern Irish MPs, it has emerged, back the EU plan for a Belfast office. Ten of 18 MPs elected to Westminster reject the government’s argument, including Sinn Fein, who do not take their seats. The Democratic Unionist party, who make up the remaining eight, support the government, whose position was outlined by the paymaster general, Penny Mordaunt, on Monday. In a letter to senior EU officials including the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, Mordaunt said a special EU office would be “divisive in political and community terms” and was not required by the Irish protocol agreed last October. Stephen Farry, the Alliance MP for North Down, accused the government of being petty and counterproductive. “This gamesmanship from the UK government is reflective of their wider approach of not taking preparations for the implementation of the protocol seriously,” he said. Other MPs supporting the Belfast office see the EU presence as important to guarantee the rights of Northern Irish citizens, who have the right to hold both British and Irish citizenship under the Good Friday agreement. Anyone with Irish citizenship is automatically an EU citizen. This argument does not chime with how Brussels views the office, which it conceives as narrowly focused on upholding single market rules, staffed by vets and customs experts. The office would not have an ambassador nor engage in diplomatic niceties such as lunches and cocktail parties. The Irish protocol, agreed after months of bitter wrangling that helped end Theresa May’s government, leaves Northern Ireland de facto in the EU single market, following about 280 EU laws covering animal health, food safety and VAT, as well as the EU customs code. The protocol specifies UK officials are responsible for implementing EU law, but EU officials have the right to be present during any activities related to putting it into practice. It does not specify the right to an EU office. Mairead McGuinness, an Irish vice-president of the European parliament, said Northern Ireland would be “particularly affected by EU decisions” and an office could enable better understanding on both sides. “Belfast is perhaps more neutral than having such an office, tasked with overseeing the protocol’s implementation in Northern Ireland, in Dublin or London.” The government says it is ready to support ad hoc visits, but the EU argues it would be impractical for officials based overseas to be routinely flying in. The argument will be revisited on Thursday when officials on the Irish “specialised committee” meet for the first time, one of six technical groups on implementing the Brexit withdrawal agreement, who report to the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, and the European commission vice-president Maroš Šefčovič. Gove and Šefčovič co-chair the “joint committee”, the political management in charge of implementing the withdrawal agreement. The Guardian has learned that the Irish specialised committee will be co-chaired by Brendan Threlfall, a former deputy director for Ireland and Northern Ireland at the defunct Brexit department. Threlfall, who is said to be close to Gove, stepped into the Brexit role in 2018 after the lead official tasked with finding a solution to the Irish border quit for a new job working for Prince William. The EU co-chair will be Philippe Bertrand, who was Barnier’s lead negotiator on the Brexit taskforce for the divorce bill, agriculture, fisheries and maritime policy. He will alternate with Thomas Lieflaender, the deputy head of the European Commission’s Brexit team. EU concerns about the British commitment to implementing the protocol escalated after Gove told the Brexit select committee on Monday that the joint committee was an opportunity to “develop” the protocol. The EU has always said the joint committee can only implement the withdrawal agreement."
2020-04-29T13:51:04Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson back at work at No 10 after Carrie Symonds gives birth,"Boris Johnson is back at work in Downing Street and is not expected to take paternity leave at the moment, after the birth of his son in the early hours of Wednesday. The prime minister’s press secretary said he would take paternity leave later in the year, after he and his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, welcomed their child at an NHS hospital in London. Johnson was present throughout the birth but later returned to work in No 10. He missed prime minister’s questions at noon, which was taken by his de facto deputy, Dominic Raab, but he did take part in a phone call with Labour leader Keir Starmer in the early afternoon. Having taken three weeks off to be treated for and recuperate from coronavirus, it is understood Johnson is determined to be present in Downing Street for the crucial decisions that need to be taken in the coming weeks on exiting the lockdown. He is also keen to preserve privacy around the birth of his son, who is thought to be either his sixth or seventh child. He has four children with his estranged wife, Marina Wheeler, and another child with the art critic Helen McNamara but has always declined to say how many sons and daughters he has overall.
“The prime minister is delighted by the birth of his baby son and I’m not going to comment on his other children,” the press secretary said. The spokesman would not name the hospital that delivered the baby, the time of arrival, or birth weight. He also declined to say whether it was a premature birth, as the couple had previously said Symonds was due in “early summer” or whether the delivery was a medical emergency. A statement released by the couple earlier on Wednesday said they had a “healthy baby boy at a London hospital earlier this morning”.
A spokeswoman for the prime minister and his partner said both mother and baby were “doing very well”. The spokeswoman said: “The prime minister and Ms Symonds are thrilled to announce the birth of a healthy baby boy at a London hospital earlier this morning. Both mother and baby are doing very well.

2020-04-29T13:05:02Z,politics,Politics,Starmer criticises government over 'truly dreadful' coronavirus death rate,"The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, criticised the government over the UK’s “truly dreadful” Covid-19 death rate at prime minister’s questions, saying the country was on course to have one of the worst records in Europe. Starmer, who was facing Dominic Raab at the despatch box on Wednesday for the second week in a row, said the UK had 27,241 recorded deaths when known hospital and care home figures were combined. The first secretary hit back and said it was far too early to make international comparisons. Raab was deputising for Boris Johnson as he spent time with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, after their son was born in the early hours of Wednesday. Starmer said the government’s advisers had said a figure under 20,000 would be a good outcome in March. “We are clearly way above that number and we are only part way through this crisis. We are possibly on track to have one of the worst death rates in Europe,” he said.
“On Monday, the prime minister said in his short speech that many were looking at our apparent success in the United Kingdom. Does the first secretary agree with me that far from success, these figures are truly dreadful?” On the 20,000 figure, Raab said the coronavirus pandemic was unprecedented and the scientific and medical advisers’ understanding of the illness had developed since that comment was made. He also said figures on deaths were collated at different times and they were keen to deliver a clearer breakdown of deaths in NHS and care homes, which they were making progress on. “I absolutely share his, I guess, our, joint horror at the number of deaths. Tragedies each and every one,” said Raab. “Equally I’m going to disagree with him that it is far too early to make international comparisons. If they are to be done, they should be on a per capita basis. We are already seeing there are different ways that deaths are measured not just in the UK, but across Europe and across the world.” On Johnson’s reference, on Monday, that there is a second phase of coronavirus response planning, Raab said it was too early to spell out exact plans. Raab was also accused of incorrectly saying deaths in care homes were on the decline in a recent statement. The latest figures released by the Care Quality Commission were 4,343 deaths for the two-week period up to Friday 24 April. Starmer put it to Raab that deaths in care homes were in fact rising as they fell in the NHS. In his response, Raab said there were positive signs on the numbers of deaths in care homes but they are “within the margin of error”. The principal challenge in care homes, unlike in NHS settings, was the ebb and flow of residents and staff and a less centralised structure, he said."

2020-04-29T11:02:52Z,politics,Politics,Birth of baby gives dilemma for Johnson at time of national crisis,"Boris Johnson has had quite an April, even aside from leading the country during the worst pandemic for more than a century. With a spell in intensive care with life-threatening coronavirus symptoms at the start of the month and the birth of a son in the early hours of Wednesday morning, the demands of his political office have temporarily had to take a back seat at a moment of national crisis. Johnson has only been back in Downing Street since Monday, after being admitted to hospital on 5 April following 10 days of worsening coronavirus symptoms, followed by two weeks of recuperation at Chequers. He will now miss his first appearance in the Commons, for prime minister’s questions, in a month, after his spokesman confirmed Carrie Symonds, his fiancee, had given birth to a boy in a London hospital. While the congratulations flow in for the new family, the next question will be whether Johnson takes a further two weeks of paternity leave, at a time when crucial decisions need to be taken imminently about the UK’s strategy for easing the lockdown. Even if he does return to work sooner than he might have planned, the presence of a new baby in Downing Street will only add to the demands on the prime minister, who has been warned not to overdo things during his recovery from the virus. The birth of a baby – as well as sympathy for his severe illness - is likely to create a degree of goodwill towards Johnson among a large section of the public.
Any bounce in the polls for the Conservatives will no doubt be welcomed by Downing Street. However, the dilemma for the prime minister will be how far to concentrate on his recuperation and family life at a time when the government is in dire need of some decision-making and direction. Public opinion has so far been largely supportive of the government, with surveys showing majority backing for Johnson’s actions despite criticism from academics and medics that it was too slow to impose lockdown. However, No 10 knows that the next few weeks will be crucial as ministers seek a difficult balance between limiting pressure on the NHS and unwinding social distancing rules, and advisers are well aware that goodwill can evaporate quickly if leaders are not perceived to be leading during a crisis."
2020-04-29T07:05:28Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel expected to be cleared of bullying by Cabinet Office inquiry,"Priti Patel is expected to be cleared this week of bullying senior civil servants in three separate government departments, Whitehall sources have confirmed. The home secretary had been accused of breaching the ministerial code by mistreating staff at the Home Office, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and the Department for International Trade. She is still to face claims from her former Home Office permanent secretary, Sir Philip Rutnam, who is using whistleblowing laws to take her to an employment tribunal for constructive dismissal. Reports of her impending clearance have prompted condemnation of the Cabinet Office inquiry process, which is conducted in secret and offers no recourse for complainants. Boris Johnson has already been criticised for compromising the process by insisting, before the inquiry had concluded, that he would continue to support Patel. Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, including Rutnam, said the cabinet inquiry process should be reviewed. “It tells you everything that is wrong with investigations under the ministerial code that a process which is not written down, which contains no rights for those who might complain, that is determined in secret, alone by a prime minister who has already pledged his allegiance to the minister in advance, and which allows no right to transparency or challenge for anyone who complained, would then be leaked on the evening before the home secretary is due to appear before the home affairs select committee,” he said. Informed sources said on Tuesday that Patel, the MP for Witham, is on the verge of being officially cleared. The Cabinet Office inquiry was conducted by Helen MacNamara, the propriety and ethics director general, and Sir Alex Allan, the independent adviser on ministers’ interests.
Before its findings are announced, the inquiry would have to be signed off by the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, and Boris Johnson. Patel has been accused of bullying at least three officials in the Home Office. According to reports, a senior Home Office official collapsed after a fractious meeting with her. Patel is understood to have successfully asked for another senior official in the department to be moved from their job. Rutnam subsequently wrote to all senior civil servants in the department highlighting the dangers of workplace stress, and made clear they could not be expected to do unrealistic work outside office hours. Rutnam resigned in February and accused Patel of orchestrating a “vicious” campaign against him, of lying about her involvement in it, and of creating a climate of fear in her department. Officials in her private office at the Department for International Development had made a “tsunami” of complaints about her behaviour, it was alleged. She was accused of ridiculing and belittling staff and exerting “heavy pressure” in emails. There were also allegations that one member of staff at the DWP had taken an overdose after clashing with her, a charge her allies dismissed. Labour said the inquiry into the allegations against the home secretary must be made public “as soon as possible”. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove was written to by his Labour opposite number Rachel Reeves, and shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds, calling for transparency. “At a time when additional powers are being assumed by the Government, the imperative that the public are completely assured of the conduct of senior ministers is even greater,” they wrote. “As a result, we are calling on you to ensure that the findings of the inquiry are published as soon as possible. Parliament should also be updated this week about the progress of the inquiry and the timing of its completion.” Friends of Patel have consistently argued that she has behaved properly at all times, some saying she had been the victim of sexism and snobbery from senior staff. After Labour called for a Cabinet Office inquiry into the claims, Johnson defended Patel in the Commons, saying he would “stick with Prit”. She is due to appear before the home affairs select committee on Wednesday morning."
2020-04-28T22:14:18Z,politics,Politics,GMB boss Tim Roache resigns suddenly with health issues cited,"Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB trade union, has abruptly resigned just five months after being re-elected. In a statement released late on Tuesday night, the union, which represents more than 600,000 workers and has more than 80 members among MPs, blamed ill health for his sudden departure. “Tim has unfortunately been suffering with ill health for some time now and has made the difficult decision to stand down from his role, that he does not feel able to continue, in leading our union going forward,” it said. However, some union sources suggested Roache’s departure followed a clash with senior GMB officials over allegations relating to his personal conduct. The statement continued: “A meeting with the finance and general purposes committee will be convened to discuss the resignation and further updates will follow.” The GMB backed Lisa Nandy in Labour’s recent leadership contest, helping her to secure a place on the final ballot paper, and Angela Rayner for deputy leader. The union holds two seats on Labour’s ruling national executive committee. Roache is a GMB lifer, having started in the union’s postroom in 1979, and rising to be its general secretary in 2015 – being regarded at the time as from the leftwing of the Labour movement. He was re-elected last November with 61% of the vote. During Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, the GMB was sometimes regarded as a more moderate voice than Unite, whose general secretary, Len McCluskey, was an outspoken backer of Corbyn. Roache spoke out about the party’s handling of antisemitism in 2018, saying he had been shocked by some of the examples he had seen. “Antisemitism is a problem in the Labour party. I’ve been shocked at what I’ve seen on social media,” he said. More recently, he hit back on social media at critics of the GMB’s response to the leaked Labour report, which reproduced dozens of lurid private WhatsApp messages from staff hostile to Corbyn. The GMB branch had called for Labour to protect those named in the report. Replying to claims that this was an attack on the party’s general secretary, Jennie Formby, Roache tweeted: “The GMB is NOT going for Jennie. FACT.”"
2020-04-28T19:37:17Z,politics,Politics,No 10 unable to say if Boris Johnson will face Keir Starmer at PMQs,"Downing Street was unable to say on Tuesday night if Boris Johnson will face Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday. With less than 24 hours before the prime minister was due to appear in the House of Commons, Labour had not been informed whether Johnson would be fit enough to face Starmer, the new leader of the opposition, across the dispatch box. No 10 said it could not confirm whether Johnson would take part, after he returned to work in Downing Street full-time on Monday amid reports he was “raring to go”. He was described on Tuesday by Downing Street as “fine” after he chaired the daily morning coronavirus meeting and then met the chancellor and cabinet secretary. He has spent the rest of the day in meetings, reading papers and doing box work.
If he does attend, it would have been Johnson’s first appearance in parliament since he fell ill with coronavirus on 27 March. He was later taken to hospital and spent three days in intensive care and then two weeks recuperating at Chequers. However, Johnson is expected to have a phone call with Starmer on Wednesday afternoon to discuss the coronavirus crisis, even if he does not take prime minister’s questions. Last week, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, took prime minister’s questions in Johnson’s absence while he was still deputising. Starmer used his first outing as Labour leader in the Commons to accuse the government of being far slower than other EU countries on testing and said its personal protective equipment strategy was not working."
2020-04-28T18:28:04Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus live: government to publish daily care home deaths as hospital toll rises to 21,678 - as it happened","Almost a quarter of coronavirus deaths in England and Wales were in care homes, the latest weekly figures from the ONS revealed, with more than 4,300 deaths recorded in a fortnight. This marks a sharp rise from the official death toll up to 10 April, which was 1,043. From Wednesday, the government will publish daily figures for the number of coronavirus deaths in care homes and the community. This follows complaints for many weeks that by only publishing hospital deaths, figures could be underestimating the true number of deaths by as much as half, according to some estimates. The Scottish government published new guidance recommending the public should wear face coverings in â€œlimited circumstancesâ€� where it was not always possible to remain two metres apart, for instance in supermarkets and on public transport. The UK government said it was still considering advice submitted on this issue submitted by Sage last week, which maintained there is â€œweakâ€� evidence of face masks having a â€œsmallâ€� protective effect. The most important thing to maintain is physical distancing, it added. British Airways is set to make up to 12,000 workers redundant as the airlineâ€™s parent company revealed its revenue had plunged 13% in the first quarter of 2020. Announcing the cuts, IAG said it expected recovery to 2019 passenger levels to take several years. Eligibility for free coronavirus tests has been extended to NHS patients and staff who do not have symptoms, and care home residents and staff who do not have symptoms (those who do have symptoms qualify for tests already). Anyone over 65 with symptoms and anybody who needs to leave home to go to work who has symptoms, as well as members of their family, will also be eligible. And the former prime minister Theresa May urged ministers to consider the impact of lockdown for domestic abuse and mental health, as well as the economy, when deciding how quickly to lift restrictions. Speaking in a debate on the domestic abuse bill, she said there was â€œclearâ€� evidence that domestic abuse was increasing during lockdown because perpetrators have greater freedom to act and victims find it harder to leave. Thatâ€™s it from us today on the UK side, thanks to all of you for following along and to everybody who got in touch with tips and suggestions.

2020-04-28T17:52:57Z,politics,Politics,Gove graciously concedes we haven’t got every single thing right | John Crace,"There are times when Michael Gove can sound like a convincingly reassuring GP. The sort of doctor who would always be willing to go that extra mile with home visits. “Don’t you worry. You’ll soon be better. Just take the medicine and you won’t feel a thing.” Gove was in the Commons to give what came billed as an “urgent statement on public services during the coronavirus”. Only he managed to deliver it without betraying the slightest sense of urgency, even when calling it the biggest crisis since the war. Apart from the 25,000 or so – he couldn’t give a precise number as the Office for National Statistics is always playing catch-up – who had died, the UK was basically in tip-top health. Yes, things were a bit challenging, but he’d basically just like to thank everyone from NHS staff to pharmacists, social workers and lorry drivers for doing their bit. “We haven’t got everything right,” he conceded as an afterthought – a bit of humility never goes amiss – but by and large he couldn’t think of a thing he would have done differently. Lockdown and social distancing had been implemented at exactly the right time, food supply chains were all fully operational, thousands of tests had been carried out and children were learning far more from the government’s online education resources than they ever had in school. He stopped short of saying greenhouse gas emissions and shoplifting were down, but then – for all his faults – he’s not as stupid as Priti Patel. But then no cabinet minister is. In her first appearance back on the Labour frontbench for the best part of five years, Rachel Reeves was both constructive and measured in her reply. She was less interested in Gove’s palliative care homilies and more concerned about what could be done to improve the situation. What was the plan – if indeed there was one – for ending lockdown? What was the government doing about domestic abuse and the protection of vulnerable children? Why were so many doctors being forced to re-use single-use personal protective equipment? And why had the government double-counted so many items in its list of PPE already distributed? The ending of lockdown is still apparently covered by the Official Secrets Act, meaning we may find out about in 30 years’ time, but Gove was at his most Uriah Heep in his other answers. Nobody cared more about vulnerable children than he did and it was desperately unfair for Reeves to have accused the government of double-counting PPE by listing each rubber glove individually. After all, strictly speaking, each finger and thumb could have been counted separately, in which case more than five billion pieces of PPE had so far been distributed. So if anything he had underestimated his government’s achievements. Pete Wishart, the SNP’s frontbench spokesperson, was unconvinced. It was clear from the previous night’s BBC Panorama documentary that the government had failed to stockpile the right levels of PPE so why couldn’t Gove just come out and admit it? Mikey’s ears pricked up at the suggestion of any admission of wrongdoing. He’s been in politics long enough not to implicate himself in anything that might have legal liability when a public inquiry is an inevitability. The government had always stockpiled exactly the amount of PPE the scientists had recommended, Gove said, citing a hitherto unknown advisory group. It didn’t exactly tally with anything we had heard about Exercise Cygnus, the 2016 pandemic plan, but maybe this new scientific panel is the only one on which Dominic Cummings isn’t thought to have sat in the past few years. It’s not hard to see that it’s the scientists that are being lined up for the show trial when the dust finally settles. The rest of the questions were batted away with Gove’s customarily urbane bedside manner. A veneer of civility masking condescension and contempt. Even towards his fellow Tory backbenchers, who are now beginning to have their doubts over the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Sitting in front of the country’s largest Union Jack, Desmond Swayne wondered why the scheme to attract more British fruit and veg pickers – last year’s every Brexiter’s wet dream – had barely managed to attract more than 100 takers. Gove wittered on about having once dug up a potato as a teenager. Far better than the real reason that no Brits are prepared to work 12-hour days for minimum wage while being put up in caravans on site. Where are the Romanians when you need them? The one question he answered directly was Tory Mark Harper’s on the discrepancy between the capacity for testing and the number of tests administered. Anything to throw Matt Hancock under a bus. Poor Tigger is everyone’s favourite fall guy now. Of course the important figure was the number of tests taken. He had no idea if the government would meet its 100,000 target a day by the end of the month Maybe it would, maybe it wouldn’t. But as this wasn’t a commitment he personally had made he wouldn’t be taking the rap for it. A few hours later, Hancock appeared in person at the 5pm Downing Street press conference where he basically said the same thing he has said for the last week. The media needed to stop concentrating on the number of deaths and start being a bit more positive about what had been done. The fact that the UK now topped the European mortality charts was just a statistical outlier. Something of which we could even be proud. We were a nation of winners. The government was doing a great job – with no thanks to the Govester – and he was determined not just to meet his testing target but to expand it. Hell, if necessary he could always ramp the figures up by testing the same people five times in as many minutes. And no, he wasn’t going to apologise for anything. Why should he? If he was going down, he would be making sure to take as many of his colleagues with him."
2020-04-28T17:16:40Z,politics,Politics,"Contact tracing can’t be run by Westminster, experts warn","Ministers must relinquish their top-down control of the coronavirus epidemic after the lockdown to allow millions of people potentially infected with Covid-19 to be traced and supported by local teams in their own communities, say experts. Urgent discussions have begun between central government, local authorities and public health officials about the 18,000-strong army promised on Friday by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to help trace the contacts of people who test positive or have symptoms of the coronavirus. Hancock said they would be in place within three weeks but the Guardian understands that nobody has yet been recruited.
A letter to local authorities and other agencies on Friday, seen by the Guardian, said just 3,000 of these people would have public health expertise, while the other 15,000 would be call handlers. It is understood that ministers such as Hancock, who is enthusiastic about digital technology, hoped the NHS app would take much of the strain. The app is designed to warn people who have come into close contact with anyone who has Covid-19 to go into self-isolation. The government hoped that a high proportion of the population – up to 80% – would download the app on a smartphone. But in meetings, they have been advised that is unrealistic. In Singapore, with high smartphone use, the take-up was only 20%.
Public health experts say that apps are no substitute for a sympathetic and supportive conversation, even for those who are familiar and comfortable with using smartphones, which many older and more vulnerable people are not. “It is absolutely ridiculous. You need the shoe-leather epidemiology, you need people on phones. Apps are simply supports for contact tracing,” said Allyson Pollock, a professor of public health at Newcastle University. “You need people on old-fashioned things like telephones or going door to door and they need to be local teams because they need to understand the local communities.” The whole system should be run by directors of public health and environmental health officers based in local authorities, with the resources they need, because they understand their community, she said. That was how it used to be, before the multiple restructuring culminating in the Health and Social Care Act 2012, which led to the decimation of public health disease control and its centralisation and fragmentation, she added.
“We don’t know where the block is, but there is a huge block and huge resistance to doing this locally. This is partly because they’ve ripped out so much capacity and they’ve also ripped out the real-time data locally. “We are never going to get on top of this if we don’t put back the local capacity in order to lift local restrictions.” Contact tracing began immediately after the first case was confirmed in England at the end of January but stopped abruptly across the whole of UK – even in regions with barely any cases – on 12 March, along with community testing. The government said it was moving from the “contain” to the “delay” phase because it was no longer possible to track down and isolate everyone infected. Countries that continued to follow that plan, as urged by the World Health Organization (WHO), have had fewer deaths. They include Germany, Singapore and South Korea. The UK “gave up very early”, said Anthony Costello, a professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London and a former WHO director. By 12 March, there had been 10 deaths and 590 confirmed cases, and about 3,500 contacts had been traced. But most of the cases were in London and the West Midlands. Continued testing, tracking and tracing could have kept the virus out of other regions and reduced deaths, he said. “If we hadn’t stopped it on 12 March, our epidemic would have been much less. They effectively allowed it to spread,” he said. Public health, local government and environmental health officers all say they are capable of running the sort of extensive contact tracing network that will be needed in all areas of the country. “Directors of public health – and their teams – have extensive experience and knowledge of contact tracing, their local communities and the wider health and social care system,” said Dr Jeanelle de Gruchy, the president of the Association of Directors of Public Health. “Engaging directors of public health in the design and implementation of any new plan will help ensure whatever is developed will work on the ground and be integrated with other aspects of the response to Covid-19, including testing and protecting vulnerable people across the UK. “The reality is that no single organisation or agency, whether national or local, can deliver and oversee this operation alone. A collaborative approach is fundamental. The government needs to fully involve us in this.”
The Chartered Institute of Environmental Health said its members and also many other people with expertise, such as retired doctors, had been in touch wanting to help. “We have quite early on opened up a national voluntary register,” said Gary McFarlane, its Northern Ireland director. “My own view is that we need a national media call for those who have the skills – all those retired doctors and sexual health workers and environmental health officers who can hit the ground running.” As businesses start to open, whether garden centres or offices or factories, local authorities would be busy engaging with them to ensure they did it safely – so the retired volunteers could help reduce their workload by taking on the contact tracing effort. A government spokesperson said: “Tracing and testing those with symptoms of Covid-19 is essential if we are to limit the spread of this virus and save lives. “The NHS is developing a contact tracing app, which alongside effective tracing and testing, is designed to give our country the confidence it needs to return to normality. “We are working with clinicians, scientists and other specialists to plan a safe, staged path to national rollout.” • Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"
2020-04-28T14:17:35Z,politics,Politics,"NHS app, testing and contact-tracing: how will the UK's coronavirus plan work?","NHS app The NHS CV19 app will enable the public to report their symptoms and order a swab test online if available. The NHS has chosen to go with its own model rather than one proposed by Apple and Google, and hopes it will be ready in two to three weeks, though the timetable for rollout is unclear. Once someone installs the app, it will start logging the distance between the user’s phone and others nearby that also have the app installed, using Bluetooth Low Energy. This anonymous log of how close they are to others will be stored securely on their phone, according to a letter to local authorities and public health directors from Public Health England. If they become unwell with symptoms of Covid-19, they can choose to let the app inform the NHS. That will trigger an anonymous alert to other app users with whom they spent time over the previous few days. Those users will get an alert telling them they have been close to someone with the virus. It may advise them to self-isolate.
Testing Although Matt Hancock, the UK health secretary, claims we are on track for 100,000 tests a day by Thursday, the latest figures for 26 April show only 37,000 tests carried out. There is no plan to test all contacts of people who have the virus. Prof Neil Ferguson’s modelling team at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis said in their latest report on 23 April that “testing of contacts would require substantial test numbers and significant investment of laboratory and staff resources”.
There were 15,000 calls from people reporting potential Covid-19 symptoms every day to the NHS 111 helpline between 18 March and 16 April. Testing them and three contacts each, assuming a low number because of the lockdown, would require 60,000 tests to be done every day. So they are all likely to be told to self-isolate without testing. Contact tracers Hancock has talked of recruiting 18,000 contact tracers, but the scheme is still evolving, with input from regional directors of public health. Of these, the government has proposed 15,000 should be call handlers, so only 3,000 would be trained public health staff including environmental health officers and probably sexual health staff with experience of contact tracing and knowledge of their communities. In early April, the government was accused of missing an opportunity after it failed to deploy 5,000 experienced contact tracing experts employed by councils to help limit the spread of coronavirus. According to the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, the UK has at least 5,000 environmental health officers working in local councils nationwide but Public Health England said at the time it would use its own local health protection teams."
2020-04-28T13:56:46Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock urged to publish secret review of pandemic plans,"Campaigners said they would press the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to publish in full a secret review of the UK’s preparations to deal with a flu-like pandemic after a partial leak revealed it had warned the country was not ready to cope. Exercise Cygnus, a 2016 dry run to test how the UK would respond, specifically warned that social care would struggle in a pandemic crisis but did not discuss in detail the need for testing or protective equipment for carers. Elements of the 57-page document were leaked to the Sun on Tuesday but the full document remains secret, prompting renewed calls from an NHS doctor, Moosa Qureshi, and his lawyers Leigh Day for the government to release it without delay.
According to the newspaper, the report’s author, Helen Shirley-Quirk, the then director for emergency preparedness and health protection policy at the Department of Health, wrote: “The UK’s preparedness and response is not currently sufficient to cope with the extreme demands of a severe pandemic.” The full document, written in 2017, recognised that a pandemic outbreak was “the most significant civil emergency risk” facing the UK. It was shared around the government, but ministers have refused to make it public amid concerns that its conclusions could frighten the public. Cygnus took place over three days in October 2016 and was led by Dame Sally Davies, the then chief medical officer for England. The document concluded: “The exercise did show that the UK’s capability to respond to a worst case pandemic influenza should be critically reviewed.”
Campaigners led by Qureshi, a member of the whistleblowers campaign group 54000 Doctors, first called for Cygnus to be made public over the weekend, arguing that publication would allow the public to see whether its recommendations had been properly followed through. A crowdfunding page to help commence judicial review proceedings has already raised more than £33,000 of the £50,000 required to meet legal fees. Members of Qureshi’s legal team indicated that the latest leaks highlighted the need to get the full document into the public domain. “The Government’s position is now untenable,” Qureshi added. Hancock told LBC radio on Tuesday morning that he had been advised by officials that the lessons of Cygnus had been taken on board, when reports of the existence of the secret exercise began circulating a month ago. “I asked my officials to go back when this first came up in the press a few weeks ago and check that everything that was recommended was done and that’s the assurance that I got,” the minister said, adding the exercise took place “before my time”, when Jeremy Hunt was health secretary. The latest leak includes some further details. Cygnus warned that social care could be at risk of collapse, partly because it was expected that the NHS would discharge elderly patients into increasingly crowded care homes.
It concluded that an NHS under severe pressure would have to concentrate its efforts on treating younger and fitter patients through a process of “population triage” – and that as many of half of health service staff could be off sick. But there was only one reference to personal protective equipment – a recommendation that more distribution points were needed around the country – suggesting the issue that has dogged the NHS in the current crisis was not deemed a high priority in the dummy exercise. Hancock said the UK’s preparations were “were amongst the most extensive in the world”. But he added there were also limits to what could be done in advance, particularly given that Cygnus was focused on a future outbreak of flu, not coronavirus. “You can’t prepare for a virus that is itself new by its nature,” the minister said."
2020-04-27T18:10:43Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus live: some non-Covid NHS treatments to restart, as 360 hospital deaths take toll to 21,092 - as it happened","Hereâ€™s a summary of some of the key events in another day of fast-moving developments in the UK as the coronavirus pandemic continues: Boris Johnson says it is too soon to ease the lockdown. Speaking outside Downing Street after spending time recuperating at Chequers, the prime minister said although he acknowledged the pressure to relax the rules, he highlighted that this was also a moment of â€œmaximum riskâ€�. He said: â€œThis is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle [coronavirus] to the floor, and so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity. This is the moment when we can press home our advantage. It is also the moment of maximum risk, because I know that there will be many people looking now at our apparent success and beginning to wonder whether now is the time to go easy on those social distancing measures.â€� The NHS will restart some vital services, including cancer care, from tomorrow, health secretary Matt Hancock says, as he admitted the government has a â€œlot of workâ€� to do to hit its 100,000 a day testing target. Some 29,058 tests had been carried out in England, Scotland and Wales in the 24 hours up to 9am on Saturday, according to the latest figures, suggesting the Government is way off its 100,000 a day target set for this Thursday. But Hancock claimed the government was â€œbroadly where we expected to beâ€� in terms of testing capacity but admitted there was a lot of work to do to hit the 100,000 a day goal. A further 360 people have died in UK hospitals in the last 24 hours after contracting Covid-19, representing a dip in the daily number of fatalities. It means that so far 21,092 people have died in UK hospitals to date after testing positive for the virus. The figure does not include those who have died in care homes so the true coronavirus death toll is likely to be significantly higher. The 360 daily death toll is down from 413 yesterday. The families of NHS and social care staff who die during their coronavirus work will get payments worth Â£60,000, health secretary Matt Hancock has announced. The government is looking at what can be done to help the families of other frontline workers who have died during the crisis, he says. So far, 82 NHS and 16 social care workers have died during the pandemic, he added. Firms will be able to get loans worth up to Â£50,000, chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced, as part of a â€˜bounce backâ€™ scheme for businesses with 100% government backing. Companies will be able to get loans worth up to 25% of turnover, with a maximum payment of Â£50,000, he told the Commons. The government will pay the interest for the first 12 months, he says. And the government will back them 100%. He describes them as â€œbounce backâ€� loans, and he says people will be able to apply from Monday next week. There will be no forward-looking eligibility test, he says. Children are falling ill with a new and potentially fatal combination of symptoms apparently linked to Covid-19, including a sore stomach and heart problems. The children affected appear to have been struck by a form of toxic shock syndrome. Some have been left so seriously unwell that they have had to be treated in intensive care. At least one has undergone extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment, which is used when someoneâ€™s life is at risk because they can no longer breathe for themselves. The names of some of the experts on the scientific group advising the UK governmentâ€™s response to the coronavirus crisis will be published â€œshortlyâ€�, the governmentâ€™s chief scientific adviser has said. It comes after the Guardian revealed the involvement of the prime ministerâ€™s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, in meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Cummingsâ€™ attendance and participation in the groupâ€™s meetings raised questions about the independence of its scientific advice. After mounting pressure on Downing Street to disclose more details about the group â€“ whose membership and advice the government has kept secret â€“ Sir Patrick Vallance told a briefing for science journalists that the identities of the experts are usually revealed after the emergency is over, and that had also been the advice for the coronavirus crisis."
2020-04-27T17:25:36Z,politics,Politics,'Invisible mugger': how Boris Johnson's language hints at his thinking,"In his first podium speech since he left intensive care earlier this month, Boris Johnson described coronavirus as a “physical assailant”. It was “an unexpected and invisible mugger”, he told the nation, giving a colourful twist to the martial metaphors he and his cabinet have tended to use when talking about the disease (in March, he described the crisis as a “fight … in which every one of us is directly enlisted”). Perhaps it’s appropriate that the prime minister chose to personify Covid-19 more directly than in the past. He has, after all, emerged from his own very intimate bout with the virus. And it’s not surprising that the pandemic has proved fertile ground for linguistic invention either: things aren’t readily accessible to the five senses – whether abstract concepts like Brexit, or invisible pathogens – tend to get “translated”, via metaphor, into easily graspable images. That process, though, is not a neutral one. As linguists such as George Lakoff have pointed out, the metaphors we choose both reflect our prejudices and influence our approach to the world. With Brexit, no deal was either a “cliff edge” or a “clean break”, depending on where your sympathies lay. The “physical assailant” metaphor is one way to look at the challenge of coronavirus, but it is not the only one. Some have taken to social media to complain that the idea of the “surprise attack” disguises the fact that the government had many weeks to prepare a better response to the pandemic than the one it has executed. People with cancer have long lamented the drawbacks of framing the disease process as a “battle”. And the prime minister’s idea that we “wrestle [coronavirus] to the floor” would seem at odds with the patient, precise work that will have to be done, over many months, to keep it at bay.

2020-04-27T17:22:22Z,politics,Politics,A deflated Boris Johnson struggles to muster his usual ebullience | John Crace,"Even the Messiah needs to ease himself back to work gently. So rather than hold a press conference where he might be expected to face some tricky questions, Boris Johnson chose to mark his return with a quick statement outside a Downing Street decorated with children’s tributes to the NHS shortly after 9am in the morning. Given that it’s only two weeks since he came out of intensive care, this was unsurprisingly very much a Boris-lite appearance. Literally so, for he seemed to have lost weight with his suit now being several sizes too large, his face washed out and tired and his hair in urgent need of a trim. Nor were there any of the familiar upbeat enthusiasm and ebullience to his speech. The references to Churchill all fell rather flat and his performance seemed to be geared towards reminding himself as much as the country that he was back in charge. On the upside, even an underpowered Boris is an improvement on Priti Patel or Grant Shapps. He was here because he was here. That seemed to be the main thrust of what he had to say. He was grateful to the NHS, he was grateful to the public for by and large containing their impatience with lockdown – though the internal battle between his own cabinet on the timing of any relaxation in the guidance seems to have encouraged more people to make up their own rules – and we were making progress against the coronavirus mugger. Not exactly the best analogy to use, as the most sensible advice when faced with a bloke with a six-inch knife is to give him whatever he wants. In Boris World, a mugging is just a harmless duffing up by the Bash Street Kids. “Many will be looking at our apparent success,” Boris continued. At which the only sound to be heard was of jaws hitting the pavement. To be fair, even he looked a bit embarrassed at that line. So far, the UK has recorded more than 20,000 coronavirus deaths in hospital and possibly as many as that again at home and in care homes. Which would already be roughly the number of civilians who died during the Blitz in the second world war, with the prospect of many thousands still to follow. If that’s a success, I’d hate to see what failure looked like. Or perhaps, the prime minister regards it as a matter of honour to top the European mortality figures. Either way, most other countries will be looking at the UK as an object lesson in how not to handle a pandemic. What followed was, in its way, just as startling. In claiming to have protected the NHS by flattening the levels of infection, he completely forgot to mention his government’s own negligence in failing to provide adequate supplies of personal protective equipment for NHS staff and care home workers. Nor did he offer any explanation or apology for his failure to take the coronavirus seriously right from the start of the pandemic, a decision that may have cost many thousands of lives. Nor was there any recognition that other countries that had implemented a rigorous “test, track and trace” policy had achieved far more success in containing the coronavirus. Or that his 250,000 daily testing target had always been bollocks. As so often, it was the subtext of what Johnson didn’t say that provided by far the more informative meta narrative. By now, Boris was beginning to develop a hunted look in his eyes. His own brush with death has provided him with just a hint of conscience previously absent throughout his political career. The eyes are a window into a very troubled soul. He can sense the stench of battery chickens staying at home to roost. He talked of transparency when his government has done everything it could to keep Dominic Cummings’s role in the Sage meetings secret. He talked of bringing in opposition parties, though none would do so without first making clear that they would never have started from the current position. He talked of reaching the second phase without saying how many phases he expected there to be. Mainly because he just doesn’t know. Three? Four? Five? He’s flying blind.
Just wittering on about enthusiasm and determination no longer cuts it. The situation has outgrown Boris’s capacity for being serious. He knows he faces some tough choices in the next few weeks. A cabinet battle between the hawks who reckon tens of thousands more old people dying is a price worth paying to kick-start the economy and the doves who put the nation’s health as its first priority is looming. With him stuck somewhere in the middle. And Boris has never been in politics to make enemies. He’s Mr Fun Guy. All the tough decisions he has made have only ever been taken by accident. By default: the law of unintended consequences. Now he really is going to have to take the tough calls that will define his legacy. The honeymoon period of his resurrection will be over in a matter of days. Then comes judgment day. Whatever he does, he risks losing the confidence of half the cabinet and half the country. And the tricky calls will keep on coming. Over at the Brexit committee, Michael Gove had clearly taken far too many psychedelics, as he imagined the coronavirus could make a UK-EU deal far more likely. Hilary Benn, the committee chair, just looked bewildered. How can you possibly reach an outline of an agreement in two months, when no one has a clue what the global economy will be like in a year’s time? Nor can you blame a botched Brexit deal on the coronavirus without first spelling out your negotiating objectives. Something the government has so far refused to do. Welcome to another week in the Fantasy Factory."
2020-04-27T16:30:23Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak backs down and offers small firms 100% loan guarantees,"Britain’s smallest businesses will be offered 100% government-backed rescue loans after sharp criticism for the slow take-up of emergency bank lending during the coronavirus crisis. In a climbdown following mounting pressure on the government to overhaul its emergency loan scheme after thousands of cash-starved firms were denied support, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said small firms would be offered new “bounce back loans” from next week with full government backing. Sunak had said as recently as last week he was “not persuaded” by calls to provide a 100% state guarantee, despite less than half of all applicants for support securing an emergency loan. Designed to provide smoother access to cash for small companies facing difficulty accessing existing government-backed lending, Sunak said businesses would be able to apply for “micro-loans” worth up to 25% of their turnover, up to £50,000. The chancellor had faced rising pressure from business groups and Labour to boost the generosity of the government guarantee on its emergency loan scheme during the pandemic. However, Sunak stopped short of providing a 100% guarantee to big firms, saying taxpayers shouldn’t be exposed to the risks of large company failures.
Announcing the scheme in parliament, Sunak said small firms could apply for the new loans from high-street banks from as early as next Monday. “I know that some small businesses are still struggling to access credit. They are in many ways the most exposed businesses to the impact of the coronavirus and find it hard to access credit in the first place. They will need extra support to get through this crisis,” he said. The new loans provide high-street banks with a guarantee that the state will refund the bank for the entire value of the loan if a borrower is unable to repay, up from 80% on the government’s existing coronavirus business interruption loan (CBILs). Although firms do not get government money if they cannot repay a loan, the scheme is designed to encourage banks to lend to firms when they might ordinarily turn down a loan application, because the state shoulders all of the risk. The Treasury had previously resisted calls to offer 100% guarantees, believing that banks needed to share the risk with taxpayers. Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference last week, the chancellor said: “I’m not persuaded that moving to a 100% guarantee is the right thing to do.” Although other countries including Switzerland have offered 100% guarantees on emergency lending, Sunak said Britain had offered firms much more help through other means, including tax cuts and wage subsidies, meaning such steps were not required. However, thousands of businesses across the country have continued to complain that the CBILs scheme was cumbersome and included too many financial hurdles that many businesses were unable to overcome.
The business lobby group the CBI, and the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, had intervened in recent weeks, suggesting that an increase in the state-backed guarantee to 100% would help to remove bottlenecks and speed up the lending process. Although buckling to pressure to offer full backing to small firms, Sunak dismissed calls to expand the emergency loan scheme for all companies, telling parliament: “We should not ask that ordinary taxpayers today and tomorrow to bear the entire risk of lending almost unlimited sums to businesses who may in some cases have very little prospect of paying those loans back and not necessarily because of the impact of the coronavirus.” The former chancellors George Osborne, Norman Lamont and Sajid Javid, and the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, had all called on Sunak to move to 100% government-backed business loans. Miliband said it was welcome that Sunak had changed his mind, but added: “There remain very serious issues about the working of CBILs for small- and medium-sized enterprises seeking more than £50,000 support. They will be asking why they cannot have quick turnaround loans to get them through the crisis and whether CBILs will remain as slow and cumbersome as it has so far been.”"
2020-04-27T12:03:24Z,politics,Politics,"Boris Johnson's post-coronavirus speech: what he said, and what it means","Boris Johnson’s speech on his first day at work after recovering from coronavirus was an attempt to provide reassurance that he is back at the helm of government. As he spoke outside Downing Street he touched on the lockdown, the economy and the health service’s ability to cope. Here, we look at what he said, and what it means. We are now beginning to turn the tide. If this virus were a physical assailant, an unexpected and invisible mugger, which I can tell you from personal experience it is, then this is the moment we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor. “Turning the tide” would mean that hospital admissions had decreased and the death toll had fallen persistently over a two-week period. The death toll was 413 in the 24 hours preceding Sunday, which is the lowest since the end of March, and a good sign. However, there were 449 deaths on 20 April followed by 828 the next day, so what the country needs is a sustained fall, not a yo-yoing of results. Johnson is right to say hospital admissions have fallen; Stephen Powis, the national director of Public Health England, said on Sunday: “We now have a very definite trend in the reduced number of people in hospitals with Covid-19.”
The phrase “invisible mugger” is quite Trumpian in tone – the US president refers to the illness as the “invisible enemy”. I know there will be many people looking now at our current success and beginning to wonder whether now is the time to go easy on those social distancing measures. The word success here will be controversial, even if he is using it narrowly in relation to moving through the peak and having not overwhelmed the NHS. The government’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said a death toll under 20,000 would “be a good result” but the UK has already passed that, and that is without counting the number of deaths outside hospitals, including in care homes. There have also been problems getting personal protective equipment to the health and care workers who need it, and concerns over the government’s slow response on testing. I can tell you now that preparations are under way and have been for weeks to allow us to win phase two of this fight as I believe we are now on track to prevail in phase one.” Phase one refers to the first peak of the infection and the UK is believed to be working its way out of this subject to passing five tests, which include no chance of a second spike and sorting out testing and PPE. Phase two refers to the plans that will be in place beyond the strict lockdown period while the government still pursues suppression of the virus and keeping the R-number as lower than one. To say the country is set to “prevail” feels incongruous with the death rate, which is one of the highest in Europe, the complaints about PPE and the fact it is still unknown whether Britain will reach its 100,000-a-day test target by Thursday. We did not run out of ventilators or ICU beds. We have so far collectively shielded our NHS, have been able to shield all of us, from an outbreak that would have been far worse. He is right to say that the NHS has not collapsed and significant efforts were made to build up the number of critical care beds with the opening of the Nightingale hospitals in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Harrogate. Mass procurement of ventilators has been complex, with not as many needed as first envisaged because of doctors learning more about the type of oxygen treatment needed. Dyson invested £20m in new ventilator technology asked for by the government but in the end it has not been used. Saying the NHS has been shielded could be seen as insensitive considering the number of doctors, nurses and other health workers who have died while working on the frontline. I want to serve notice now that these decisions will be taken with the maximum possible transparency. And I want to share all our working, our thinking, my thinking, with you, the British people. This might be a reference to the increasing frustration that the government has said consistently that it is “following the science” to make decisions, but that this science is not available for public scrutiny. The government may have read the mood on this one and changed its stance. It is also not known exactly who is on the scientific advisory group, Sage, although the Guardian revealed that Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, had been in attendance on what was supposed to be an independent body. It was unclear from Johnson’s statement how far he was prepared to go in terms of transparency. We will also be reaching out … across party lines, bringing in opposition parties as far as we possibly can. Although conversations have been going on between Johnson and the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, it was not clear whether the prime minister was indicating an increase in contact, or just keeping opposition parties in the loop. If it is to include Labour, for example, in shouldering the responsibility of some policy decisions, that would be a dramatic change. I know how hard and how stressful it has been to give up even temporarily those ancient and basic freedoms. Johnson is a libertarian at heart and has made much use of the language of freedom being curtailed and how it pains him personally. This kind of language is a flash of the prime minister’s own take on how people might feel about lockdown, although polling has shown that many are content with the restrictions and have not found them onerous. In fact, a Deltapoll survey showed that moving too quickly to lift restrictions was a significant worry for the British public across all generations and political groups."
2020-04-27T09:20:55Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson: UK beginning to turn the tide on coronavirus,"Boris Johnson has said the UK is turning the tide on tackling coronavirus but is still facing a moment of “maximum risk” and he will not be forced to end the lockdown prematurely. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street on Monday, his first day back after recovering from coronavirus, the prime minister gave businesses a stark warning to contain their impatience on easing restrictions.
He thanked the public for giving up their basic freedoms and said he understood how tough it had been, particularly on businesses, entrepreneurs and the hospitality sector, and that the economy was suffering. However, he spoke directly to those pushing for an end to the lockdown sooner rather than later, saying it would risk a second spike of infections and a “new wave of death”. “I can see the long-term consequences of lockdown as clearly as anyone, so yes, I entirely share your urgency,” he said. “It is the government’s urgency. And yet we must also recognise the risk of a second spike, the risk of losing control of that virus and letting the reproduction rate go back over one. “That would mean not only a new wave of death and disease but also an economic disaster and we will be forced once again to slam on the brakes across the whole country, and whole economy, and reimpose restrictions in such a way as to do more and lasting damage. “I want to get this economy moving as fast as I can, but I refuse to throw away all the effort and sacrifice of the British people and risk a second major outbreak and huge loss of life and the overwhelming of the NHS.”
He asked businesses to contain their impatience and understand that while there had been success in suppressing the illness, it was still a moment of significant national risk, despite “having begun together to wrestle [coronavirus] to the floor”. “So it follows this is the moment of opportunity, this is the moment when we could press home our advantage. It is also the moment of maximum risk,” he said. There would be a point at which the UK could “fire up the engines of this vast UK economy”, Johnson said, but that would depend on meeting the five tests the government had set itself: the death rate falling, the NHS not being overwhelmed, the infection rate going down, getting on top of testing and personal protective equipment supplies, and avoiding a second peak of the disease. Johnson said there would also be “maximum possible transparency” from now on, which may have been a direct response to mounting pressure on the government to release the scientific data it was relying on to make decisions, and to make public exactly who was sitting on its scientific advisory group, Sage. The prime minister is expected to meet ministers throughout the week and regularly host the morning Covid-19 response meetings as he gets back to work since being admitted to hospital with the virus.
Earlier, the health minister Edward Argar played down speculation that Johnson was expected to ease lockdown measures before 7 May, the next date by which ministers are due to review it. “We’re very clear at the moment the science isn’t saying we are ready to lift the restrictions that have been placed on people,” Argar said. “We’ve made huge progress, we’ve seen that curve flattened in recent weeks … but we’re not there yet.” He said the lockdown had been working and “now is not the time to let up”. The government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, has said the reproduction rate of the virus was now below one (an infected person is passing it on to fewer than one other person), but Argar would not be drawn on it in a round of morning media interviews."
2020-04-26T17:26:02Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus response utterly hypocritical, says UN poverty expert","The United Nations’ poverty expert Philip Alston has attacked the UK government’s coronavirus response as “utterly hypocritical” after successive administrations implemented policies of austerity and public-sector cuts. The UN rapporteur on extreme poverty, who in 2018 issued a blistering attack on Conservative welfare policy, also said that globally “the most vulnerable have been short-changed or excluded” by official responses to the disease, which had claimed over 203,670 lives by Sunday evening, according to Johns Hopkins University.
“The policies of many states reflect a social Darwinism philosophy that prioritises the economic interests of the wealthiest while doing little for those who are hard at work providing essential services or unable to support themselves,” Alston said, warning that the pandemic could push more than half a billion additional people into poverty globally. “Governments have shut down entire countries without making even minimal efforts to ensure people can get by,” he said. “Many in poverty live day to day, with no savings or surplus food. And of course, homeless people cannot simply stay home.” He highlighted how the most vulnerable populations had been neglected, which “forces them to continue working in unsafe conditions, putting everyone’s health at risk.” And he warned that, while some nations were seeing curves flattening, the virus was “poised to wreak havoc in poorer countries”. “As for the UK,” Alston told the Guardian, “my thoughts of course hark back to the sense of how utterly hypocritical it is now to abandon ‘austerity’ with such alacrity, after all the harm and misery caused to individuals and the fatal weakening of the community’s capacity to cope and respond over the past 10 years. “And of course, many of the worst and most damaging aspects of ‘austerity’ cannot and will not be undone. The damage caused to community cohesion and to the social infrastructure are likely to prove permanent.”
His comments are likely to anger ministers in the UK, who have said their strategy is to put their “arms around every single worker” while adopting an “everyone in” policy to tackle the risk to rough sleepers. They have sanctioned huge cash injections into wages and businesses to prevent economic collapse, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak announced £14bn for the NHS and local authorities fighting the virus. But other parts of the social fabric have been stretched. Food banks, which give out at least 1.6m parcels a year, have lacked supplies while care homes, where thousands are dying from Covid-19, have struggled for essentials including PPE and to maintain staffing levels. There have been real-terms cuts in public funding of social care in the UK, according to the King’s Fund thinktank, with a £700m reduction between 2011 and 2018. “This pandemic has exposed the bankruptcy of social support systems in many countries.” Alston said. “While some governments have embraced far-ranging measures previously dismissed as unrealistic, most programmes have been short-term, stop-gap measures that merely buy time rather than address the immense challenges that will continue well into the future. Now is the time for deep structural reforms that will protect populations as a whole and will build resilience in the face of an uncertain future.” A government spokesperson said: “We have a strong record on supporting hardworking people across the country as well as our most vulnerable, reaching record employment over the last ten years and with both income inequality and absolute poverty lower than in 2010. “These are unprecedented times and it’s right that we do everything we can to support people through this difficult period, including increasing Universal Credit by up to £1,040 over a year.”"
2020-04-26T16:00:18Z,politics,Politics,Six urgent items in Boris Johnson's inbox as he returns,"1. Leaving lockdown? Pressure has been mounting from backbench Conservative MPs – and some cabinet ministers – for elements of the stringent distancing rules imposed on 23 March to be lifted. Whitehall has been working on options – “doing the homework”, as Johnson’s deputy, Dominic Raab, put it on Sunday – but ministers have been reluctant to make any decisions without the prime minister. The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, is determined that the transmission rate of the virus – the R0, as it is known – be suppressed well below 1 before the lockdown is eased. He is also racing to get a track-and-trace system up and running to help control the virus when restrictions are eased. Meanwhile, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who unlike Hancock was present at a three-hour meeting in Chequers on Friday, is known to be keen to allow some businesses to reopen, given the catastrophic impact of a total shutdown on the economy. There are also growing anxieties over the impact of an extended lockdown on mental and physical health, domestic abuse and the welfare of vulnerable children. Johnson will have to make the ultimate decision about how to balance these and other concerns, with a formal review of the measures due by 7 May. 2. Test, test, test Matt Hancock’s self-imposed deadline of completing 100,000 tests a day by the end of April expires this week. Capacity has ramped up significantly in recent days, with all key workers now able to apply for a test – but self-administered testing kits have been running out within minutes on the government’s website, and workers have complained that they cannot book a test slot anywhere locally. The government announced at the weekend that the army will now be involved in setting up mobile testing units. Hancock has insisted his goal remains achievable – but it looks a stretch, and some colleagues feel it was always a hostage to fortune. Johnson will have to choose whether to maintain No 10’s staunch backing of Hancock, or to distance himself from the pledge (though the prime minister himself suggested 250,000 tests a day would be achievable). He will also have to decide how much of the government’s effort should be focused on the tracking-and-testing approach Hancock now regards as crucial. 3. Deciding who makes decisions, and how Johnson will have to decide whether the decision-making structure in place through the peak of the crisis remains the right one for managing its next phase. In his absence, key decisions have been made by a “quad” of ministers: Sunak, Hancock, Raab and the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, each of whom chair one of the four powerful Covid-19 committees that have been managing the government’s day-to-day response. At key turning points, decisions have also been rubber-stamped by the Cobra emergency committee, which includes representatives of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, as well as ministers and experts. In turn, Cobra receives advice from the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage). The government has repeatedly insisted its approach has been “led by the science”, but the independence of Sage has been thrown into doubt by the revelation that Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has been attending its meetings, to the disquiet of some members. The prime minister will have to decide whether Cummings should continue to attend and more broadly, which stakeholders should be included in decision-making from now on. Some Tory MPs would like to see the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, bound in to deliberations about lifting lockdown, for example – and as parts of the economy reopen, the TUC have called for the formation of a national council for reconstruction and recovery, including unions and employers as well as government. 4. Addressing his own handling of the crisis Keir Starmer confronted Raab at his first prime minister’s questions as Labour leader in a largely empty House of Commons chamber last Wednesday. This week, it will be Johnson who has to face an interrogation, without the usual supportive roar from Tory backbenchers. It comes amid mounting questions about whether the prime minister was slow to react to the crisis at the start of the year: including whether he was right to allow Hancock to lead five early Cobra meetings on the virus. A series of early decisions have been challenged, including halting the tracing of cases, allowing mass events such as the Cheltenham Festival to go ahead, and failing to act quickly enough to secure supplies of PPE. Starmer made clear in a letter to the prime minister this weekend he will try to make some of this criticism stick – and will continue to press for more details on the government’s planned exit strategy. “I fear we are falling behind the rest of the world,” the Labour leader wrote, urging Johnson to promise that no one will have to travel more than 20 minutes to have themselves tested for the virus. 5. The Brexit impasse The latest round of the (physically distanced) Brexit talks ended on Friday, with both sides blaming the other for the lack of progress. The government is accusing the EU of treating the UK more harshly than other counterparts in recent trade deals, while the EU fears ministers are backsliding on aspects of the Brexit deal struck last October. Boris Johnson is expected to ask the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and EU leaders to intervene in the negotiations in the hope of breaking the deadlock. The government must decide in June whether to seek an extension to the status quo transition period, something ministers have repeatedly insisted they are determined not to do. Only two more rounds of videoconference negotiations are currently scheduled, but Johnson may hope that his personal involvement could help, as it did last autumn. Gove is likely to reveal more about the government’s thinking when he appears before the House of Commons EU future relationship committee on Monday. 6. The Priti Patel bullying inquiry The Whitehall ethics adviser Alex Allan has reportedly completed his investigation into events surrounding the resignation of the former Home Office permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam, who accused Priti Patel of bullying – but it was set aside in the prime minister’s absence. Rutnam resigned on 29 February, claiming he had been “the target of a vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign” . He has already announced that he is taking legal action against Patel under whistleblowing laws, with the case expected to focus on her treatment of civil servants. The prime minister tasked Allan with examining Patel’s alleged conduct, and whether it contravened the ministerial code. Johnson has previously backed Patel, saying he is “sticking by her”, but that could change if Allan finds she has broken the rules."
2020-04-26T16:00:18Z,politics,Politics,"Post-Brexit trade talks with EU on course to fail, Johnson warned","Boris Johnson is expected to push for an intervention from EU leaders in the faltering trade and security negotiations with the bloc after being warned by advisers that the current talks are on course to fail. There is recognition on both sides of the talks that there is little prospect of agreement on the most contentious issues without a major reset of positions. With the prime minister set to return to Downing Street on Monday, Johnson is expected to press the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and EU nation governments to dedicate attention to the negotiation with the British government. Sources suggested that there would need to be a rethink over the next fortnight in order to rescue the negotiation. The UK will leave the single market and customs union at the end of 2020, after which tariffs will be applied to the trade in goods unless there is a deal agreed.
Both sides have said they need to see progress by June, with Downing Street warning that they may need to walk away from the talks at that point to prepare solely for a no-deal outcome. There are just two scheduled rounds of video-conference talks, and senior sources on both sides said these were not likely to deliver a deal, due to principled differences as well as the difficulties presented by the technology. “You don’t see all the faces of the people around the table; you don’t see the body language, you cannot have discussion in the margins”, an EU official said. “But having said that, this is how we are working now; we need to make the best of it.” The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his British counterpart, David Frost, came out fighting from last week’s round of talks on the future relationship, only the second since the UK left the EU on 31 January. Barnier accused the UK of not engaging with key issues of particular importance to the EU, including access to British waters for European fishing fleet and the so-called level playing field conditions to ensure neither side can undercut environmental, labour and social standards. EU sources added that UK officials “listened politely” to their proposals but did not seek to negotiate on them. “I regret it, and this worries me”, Barnier told reporters at a press conference at the end of last week’s talks. The British negotiating team has rejected the claim, instead questioning the value of the deal being proposed by Brussels, which would tie the UK to EU regulations while also constructing significant non-tariff barriers on trade. Whitehall sources said there was a difference between not engaging and simply disagreeing with the EU approach. There is a particular frustration on the UK side that the EU has rejected proposals to remove unnecessary technical barriers to trade, including some sanitary and phytosanitary checks on animal products, despite British commitments to maintain high standards and there being precedent in previous trade deals. On security cooperation, the UK has argued in the negotiating room that the EU’s offer is based on existing deals but comes with unprecedented obligations, including a direct role for the European court of justice in dispute settlements: a red line for Downing Street. Two areas in which there have been better talks are civil nuclear cooperation and UK involvement in EU programmes. “The UK has expressed interest in participating in [the research and science programme] Horizon, for example”, said an EU official. “So there’s certainly some useful discussions ongoing in this area.” However, there is growing concern about the UK’s implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement, which was designed to avoid a border on the island of Ireland. The protocol requires checks on goods passing from Britain to Northern Ireland. “You need to have customs checks on goods arriving in Northern Ireland, veterinary controls, a VAT system needs to be put in place”, said an EU official. The two sides are expected to have a stock check on 30 April at the next meeting of the joint committee, the body established to ensure implementation of the provisions in the withdrawal agreement. Frost has ruled out an extension of the transition period. The UK believes there is ample time to agree and ratify a free-trade deal if the EU changes its position."
2020-04-26T15:51:38Z,politics,Politics,Coronavirus UK live: hospital death rate rises by 413 in lowest increase since end of March - as it happened,"Here are the key points from the Downing Street briefing: The increase in daily hospital deaths from coronavirus is at it lowest level since the end of March. George Eustice, the environment secretary, said 413 people had died in hospital, taking the total to 20,732. This is the lowest level since 3o March but it is expected to increase during the working week. Eustice said furloughed workers would be encouraged to take on second jobs as fruit pickers to help farmers struggling with labour supplies. He pointed out that only a third of the usual workforce was available to farmers. Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said he would have no problem with the government publishing the membership of Sage. But Eustice defended keeping the composition of the group secret, saying: â€œItâ€™s important scientists can have discussions free of external influence.â€� He also said it was important to protect their security. Eustice claimed there had been a â€œdramatic improvementâ€� in food supplies. He said grocery supplies were back to normal levels and panic-buying had subsided. Powis said he was encouraged by the decline in hospital admissions and deaths. â€œAll our efforts, hard though they might be, have begun to pay off,â€� he said. But he added: â€œThis is not the time to say: â€˜Weâ€™ve done a good job, we need to stop complying with social distancing.â€™â€� Thatâ€™s it for today. Theyâ€™ll be more from about 7.30am on Monday.

2020-04-26T07:34:11Z,politics,Politics,Coronavirus: Johnson faces lockdown dilemma as scientists warn over grim data,"The number of new cases of Covid-19 being diagnosed is still much too high to allow any easing of the lockdown soon, leading scientists have warned, as the virus death toll in UK hospitals passed 20,000 on Saturday. The home secretary, Priti Patel, described the figure as a “terrible milestone” and a “deeply tragic and moving moment”. She said it showed the need for the British public to “stay strong” and remain at home for the foreseeable future. A further 813 deaths were reported in hospitals, taking the UK total to 20,319. This figure does not include deaths from Covid-19 in care homes, hospices and in the community.
As ministers came under increasing pressure to ease the lockdown from the business community and Tory MPs concerned at the plight of small firms in their own constituencies, scientists said the drop in new coronavirus cases being reported daily was disappointingly slow. Professor John Edmunds, a member of the government’s Sage group of Covid-19 experts, said if the lockdown was eased now, the newly enhanced testing and contact tracing system being put in place would be swamped. “The strategy behind plans to lift the lockdown is based on the idea [that] you could then control the epidemic by testing people for infections before tracing their contacts,” Edmunds said.
“However, if we lifted the lockdown now, the testing and tracing system would be overwhelmed. We will have to get case numbers down a lot lower than they are now before we can think of lifting current regulations.” Professor Keith Neal of Nottingham University agreed that the number of patients being taken to hospital with Covid-19 remained far too high. “This daily figure peaked on 5 April with 5,903 cases. This Saturday it stood at 3,583,” he added. This latter figure was boosted by an extra 1,330 new cases of infected care and health workers, which brought Saturday’s overall total to 4,913. “It has therefore taken three weeks for numbers of hospitalised Covid-19 patients to decline from a daily total of 5,903 to 3,641.” Professor Paul Hunter, of the University of East Anglia, added: “There is no doubt this rate of decline is disappointing. Certainly it is far too high to consider lifting lockdown restrictions at present. We need to get numbers down to a few hundred new cases a day before we can do that. Such a decline could take months.” With no firm indication being given by the government on when social distancing rules might be eased, prime minister Boris Johnson will return to Downing Street on Monday after convalescing at Chequers, having fallen seriously ill with Covid-19 earlier this month. The prime minister is facing an acute dilemma over the lockdown as members of his cabinet and MPs in his party argue over whether it should be eased to save the economy from collapse – the predominant view in the Treasury – or whether the public should be told to double down on restrictions to reduce the death toll. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is pushing the more cautious approach. Former chancellor Philip Hammond said on Saturday it was time that the government announced plans for an exit strategy, while Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said MPs wanted to see a strategy for desperate businesses. He said: “All members of parliament must be receiving representations from businesses large and small needing further assistance, or some sense of when they can start to plan for at least a partial release from these measures.” But Patel insisted the government’s five tests for easing the lockdown had to be met in full. “It is clear that is not right now,” she said. Amid signs that public confidence in the government’s handling of the crisis is waning in a new Opinium poll for the Observer, ministers are facing an uphill battle to meet their target of testing 100,000 people a day for Covid-19 by the end of April.
As of 9am, a total of 640,792 tests had taken place, with 28,760 being conducted on Friday. Downing Street said the prime minister had said he was “raring to go” after being given the green light by doctors, who had been closely monitoring his progress since he was discharged from St Thomas’ hospital two weeks ago. Sources said Johnson’s return “marked a tightening of grip from the PM”, who held a series of calls and teleconference meetings with key ministers last week. But on Saturday, Labour leader Keir Starmer turned up the pressure on the PM, writing to Johnson with a warning that the UK risked “falling behind the rest of the world” by refusing to discuss an exit strategy from the lockdown. Starmer wrote: “The UK government is behind the curve on this. I fear we are falling behind the rest of the world. Simply acting as if this discussion is not happening is not credible … The British public have made great sacrifices to make the lockdown work. They deserve to be part of an adult conversation about what comes next. If we want to take people with us and secure their consent, this is necessary now.” Meanwhile the Department of Health and Social Care announced that mobile testing units, operated by the armed forces, would travel around the UK to increase access to coronavirus testing. On Saturday the website offering tests to key workers was overwhelmed for the second day running by 10am, with people in the south of England reporting that the only tests available were in Scotland. The DHSC said the new units would respond to areas of highest demand, travelling to test frontline workers and the most vulnerable at sites including care homes, police stations and prisons."
2020-04-26T06:15:06Z,politics,Politics,"UK will need to extend Brexit transition, Merkel ally warns Britain","Boris Johnson must extend the UK’s transition out of the EU for up to two years to avoid compounding the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic with a hugely disruptive and disorderly Brexit, according to a close ally of Angela Merkel. In an interview with the Observer, Norbert Röttgen, chair of the Bundestag’s foreign affairs committee, said it was now impossible to see how the UK and other EU countries could agree even a minimal outline free trade agreement this year because the talks were so behind schedule. The transition period is due to end on 31 December unless the UK asks for a prolongation by 30 June. The maximum extension would be two years, under the terms of the withdrawal agreement. Röttgen said he could not see any sensible option other than for the UK to apply for the extension to avoid even more damage to the British and European economies. On Friday, Michel Barnier said there had been “limited progress” in the initial stages of “virtual” negotiations, which he said was disappointing. Röttgen, a member of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, said: “Before the current coronavirus crisis, I think it would have been possible to have a minimum agreement with the UK on the broad outlines to avoid a crash [the UK crashing out with no deal], with more detailed negotiations then taking place afterwards. “I can’t imagine now that this is possible, given the fact that all the EU countries, Brussels and London are so absorbed by the pandemic – and this will go on. Given this situation, I don’t believe that there is a realistic possibility any longer to even achieve the necessary minimum. So you have to extend.”
But he said it would be up to Boris Johnson to realise the consequences of a disorderly exit amid this pandemic. “The pandemic will cause more economic damage than we can now imagine. To think that you could then add to this extraordinary situation a very disorderly exit, to me is not imaginable. I think everyone will say that this is not in the British interest or in the interest of any of us.” The Brexit transition began when the UK left the EU on 31 January. The arrangement – under which the UK is outside the EU but continues to be subject to its rules and a member of the single market and customs union – was negotiated by both sides to smooth the UK’s exit. The transition was also designed to allow the UK to continue much of its previous relationship with the EU while the fine details of a future trading relationship and security co-operation were negotiated. Barnier cited an alarming lack of progress in four of the most crucial areas of the talks. Sources said he was greatly frustrated that the UK did not appear ready either to discuss detail or make compromises. The four areas of difference were the so-called “level playing field” (the extent to which the UK would adopt EU standards to have access to the single market); fisheries, particularly EU access to UK waters; security co-operation and governance issues. The German MEP David McAllister, who chairs the UK co-ordination in the European Parliament (correct) said both sides were now “under enormous time pressure to organise a half-way orderly exit of the UK from the single market and the customs union.” It had been hoped that an outline deal could be concluded over the coming months, in time for it to be signed off over the summer by EU leaders. But talks between the UK and EU sides are well behind schedule, although the second set of discussions, effected by video link, ended last week.
EU officials have said that concluding deals on such complex issues – already a lengthy and tortuous process – is far more difficult without face-to-face meetings. One high-level EU source said: “You can get so far but what you can’t do is go away into small groups of six or eight people in a dark room and hammer out the final, vital details. That is not possible in a virtual meeting.” The UK is also understood to have redeployed some of its staff who were posted to the EU trade talks to coronavirus duties since the Covid-19 pandemic developed. The issue of whether to apply for an extension is now emerging as a huge additional problem for Johnson, who prides himself on having “got Brexit done”. Until now, Downing Street has said it will not contemplate asking the EU for an extension under any circumstances. To do so, Johnson would have to reverse legislation that, in effect, bars him from seeking an extension, and he would have to agree additional financial contributions to the EU to pay for that extension. Another senior EU politician involved in the talks said there were signs of division appearing on the UK side, with some civil servants and Tory MPs believing the UK had to find a way to abandon its opposition to extending the transition: “I think there is a recognition by some on the UK side that they have to extend but no one knows how to do it. The question is what Johnson will decide when he returns to Downing Street after his illness. It is a big political problem for them.”
The terms of the withdrawal agreement allow a UK–EU joint committee to extend the transition period by up to two years, but it must sign off on the length of any extension before 1 July. EU lawyers say that once that window is missed, EU law makes it very difficult to agree to any extension. Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, who is regularly in touch with diplomats in EU capitals, said: “It will be very hard for both sides to reach the outlines of a free trade agreement by autumn, or indeed by June, which is when the PM wants to take a decision on whether it is worth pursuing a free trade agreement. “Last week should have been the fifth round of negotiations, but it was the second. The bottom line is that on both sides the top politicians’ attention is focused on coronavirus, not Brexit, which makes a deal in the short term highly unlikely.”"
2020-04-25T21:00:00Z,politics,Politics,Top Tories join calls to bar Cummings from scientific advisory group,"Boris Johnson is facing cross-party calls to stop his chief adviser from attending meetings of the secret scientific group advising him on the coronavirus pandemic, as demands grow for the committee’s deliberations to be made public. The former Brexit secretary, David Davis, is among those calling for Dominic Cummings and Ben Warner, an adviser who ran the Tories’ private election computer model, to be prevented from attending future meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Davis said that Cummings’s presence could alter the advice offered in meetings, adding: “We should publish the membership of Sage, remove any non-scientist members, publish their advice in full, and publish dissenting opinions with the advice.” It comes after the Guardian reported that Cummings and Warner were among the 23 who attended Sage on the day Johnson announced the lockdown, and had been able to question attendees at other meetings.
There is now a broad coalition forming to demand greater transparency about Sage. Greg Clark, the Tory chair of the Commons science committee, said: “I have great respect for [chief scientific adviser] Sir Patrick Vallance and [chief medical officer] Chris Whitty, the co-chairs of Sage. I am sure the scientists they ask to serve on the group are of the highest calibre. “For that reason, disclosing who has attended Sage meetings could reassure and enhance the standing of the body whose advice is so important to the country at this time. It would also allow for a better understanding of the range of disciplines which are shaping advice to government.” Others called for the minutes of Sage meetings to be published. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “It’s vital public confidence is maintained in this process. The membership and supporting papers should be published. Total transparency is crucial.” The acting Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, said: “The public needs to have confidence that it is expert advice that is guiding government decisions. The lack of transparency is unacceptable in this national crisis.” Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader, said: “The fact the chief medical officer of Wales couldn’t even ask questions, but Boris Johnson’s chief spin doctor had a place at the table is as shocking as it is wrong. This government needs to start treating people like grown-ups and publish the advice they are receiving.”
Downing Street reacted furiously to the initial report, adding it was “not true that Mr Cummings or Dr Warner are ‘on’ or members of Sage”. One insider was frustrated that the government was in a no-win situation. Having previously been criticised for delays and complacency, they said they were now being criticised for having senior advisers attend crucial meetings. Prof Stephen Powis, who is a Sage member and NHS England medical director, said he was confident that what happens at Sage was a “scientific discussion involving the scientists and experts who are members of Sage”. He added: “The experts, from a variety of backgrounds, discuss the evidence; they discuss the evidence base of the various topics; they come to conclusions around that evidence base,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “It is then, of course, the role of Sage to advise the government.” Asked again at the Downing Street press conference whether Cummings made contributions to Sage, Powis would only say that it is the “scientists that make the scientific contributions”. Previous scientific advisers said the details of Cummings’s involvement in the committee were crucial. Prof Derek Hill, of University College London, said: “I was on a science advisory group for dementia research when David Cameron was prime minister. Advisers from No 10 often turned up, but just as observers. “The question here is whether Cummings not only attends but actively participates in Sage. For example, does he talk more at these meetings than some of the scientists?”"
2020-04-24T17:55:03Z,politics,Politics,"Coronavirus UK: Shapps says test numbers will rise; hospital death toll reaches 19,506 â€“ as it happened","UK ministers were warned last year that the UK needed a robust plan to deal with a pandemic and its economic and social consequences, the Guardian revealed. The 600-page Cabinet Office document warned that even a mild pandemic could cost tens of thousands of lives and included recommendations such as the need to stockpile PPE and organised advanced purchase agreements for other essential supplies. It comes as the government continues to face accusations that it has reacted too slowly to to the coronavirus outbreak. Dominic Cummings, the prime ministerâ€™s chief adviser, and data scientist Ben Warner, who worked on the Vote Leave campaign, are on the secret scientific group advising the government on its response to the coronavirus pandemic, the Guardian revealed. With multiple attendees of Sage disclosing to the Guardian that both Cummings and Warner had been taking part in meetings of the group as far back as February, the inclusion of Downing Street advisers on Sage will raise questions about the independence of its scientific advice. Despite growing pressure on the government to make public more details about the group, both its membership and its advice to ministers on Covid-19 is being kept secret. The governmentâ€™s expansion of testing for key workers and their families suffered a setback after all 5,000 home test kits for key workers ran out within two minutes this morning. And the Department for Health and Social Care apologised after the website for booking tests online stopped accepting applications due to high demand. The Welsh government became the latest devolved administration to publish a plan for easing lockdown restrictions and learning to live alongside Covid-19, amid mounting pressure on the UK government to do the same. The UKâ€™s hospital death toll rose by 684 to 19,506. Transport for London announced it would furlough 7,000 workers â€“ around a quarter of its workforce â€“ from Monday for an initial period of three weeks. The move followed TfL recording a 90% revenue loss during the lockdown and is expected to save the network Â£15.8m every four weeks. The lockdown will be lifted when itâ€™s â€œsafe to do soâ€� and this depends on the number of new infections falling, the health secretary Matt Hancock said. He said he would not allow for changes to be made that are unsafe and that keeping the number of cases down is also the best thing for the economy. There is no prospect of easing the lockdown yet, he added. And thatâ€™s it for today. From the UK side, thank you so much to everybody who got in touch throughout the day, keeping me going with tips and stories, comments and suggestions, jokes and music videos. I couldnâ€™t do this without you! If youâ€™d like to continue following the Guardianâ€™s coverage of the pandemic, head over to our global live blog."
2020-04-24T16:19:39Z,politics,Politics,Top civil servant forced to clarify remarks for second time in a week,"The Foreign Office’s most senior civil servant has been forced to issue a second clarification within three days over oral evidence he gave to MPs earlier this week. Sir Simon McDonald said police were free to seek to prosecute overseas diplomats suspected of criminal offences in the UK, and cannot be directed by the Foreign Office that the diplomat has blanket immunity. His clarification overrode his previous implication that the police could not prosecute an overseas diplomat if told by the Foreign Office the individual has immunity. There have been suggestions the Northamptonshire police felt they were told by the Foreign Office it was not possible for the police to prosecute Ann Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence officer, after the car she was driving killed 19-year-old motorcyclist Harry Dunn last August. The instruction led the police to take no action to arrest Sacoolas, who left the country a fortnight later. The issue may prove important if the Dunn family are successful in their application for a judicial review into the Foreign Office’s handling of the case, since one issue may prove to be the degree of coordination between the UK police and the Foreign Office. On Tuesday, before the foreign affairs select committee, McDonald implied the police had no discretion whether to prosecute once it had been informed by the Foreign Office she had immunity. “The police will always refer immunity matters as a matter of course,” he told the committee. Foreign Office lawyers, after a few days of indecision in the immediate wake of the accident, decided Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity as the dependant of an agent working at the US spy base RAF Croughton. McDonald in his letter to the select committee also clarifies the extent of the contact between UK and state department lawyers prior to the UK concluding she had immunity. In his oral evidence, he said there had been conversations between government lawyers in Washington and London, a degree of contact criticised by lawyers acting for the family of Harry Dunn. But McDonald now says legal teams in Washington and London considered the issues separately. He said: “There were no conversations at all between the UK and US government lawyers dealing with this issue during the relevant period. The respective positions of the UK and the US were exchanged through diplomatic correspondence in the ordinary way” Foreign Office lawyers came to the view that Sacoolas had immunity since although a treaty negotiated between the UK and the US waived immunity for US agents working at the base, the treaty was silent on whether the waiver applied to their dependants. McDonald himself described the conclusion that the dependants had waivers but the agent or diplomat did not as “apparently illogical”, but argued if the treaty was silent on the dependant’s status then the law as it existed before applies. On the degree of police latitude in prosecuting a diplomat, McDonald supplements his evidence, writing: “The FCO and the police work together closely on immunity issues, and, in that context, the police will refer questions about immunity to the FCO as a matter of course. The FCO is responsible for engaging with the sending state and for seeking waivers of immunity where necessary. “However, all parties involved in these cases operate within the accepted framework of the operational independence of the police, it being for them to determine what steps to take in the investigation of criminal offences. All parties are also aware that while the FCO can provide assistance on questions of immunity, and in particular on relevant questions of fact, questions of law under the Vienna convention are ultimately for the courts (as indeed are all questions of law)”. Earlier this week, McDonald in a separate letter to the committee had to reverse a claim made at the same committee session that it had been a decision by politicians to refuse to join a EU ventilator scheme. His original claim created a political furore, but he later withdrew it."
2020-04-24T15:29:24Z,politics,Politics,"Britain running down the clock in Brexit talks, says Michel Barnier","Michel Barnier has suggested the UK is running down the clock in talks over the future trade and security relationship with the EU. The claim by the bloc’s chief negotiator during a virtual press conference at the end of a difficult week of videoconference talks was swiftly denied by the government. A UK spokesman instead openly questioned the value of the deal being offered by Brussels when compared with a no-deal outcome. “We regret that the detail of the EU’s offer on goods trade falls well short of recent precedent in free trade agreements it has agreed with other sovereign countries,” the spokesman said. “This considerably reduces the practical value of the zero-tariff, zero-quota aspiration we both share.” After five days of videoconference talks, involving a total of 100 officials, the prospects of an agreement by the end of the year seemed remote as the two sides emerged from the negotiations to attack each other. Barnier appeared exasperated by the British team, led by David Frost, who has said the UK will leave the single market and customs union with or without a deal by the end of the year.
He accused the UK of preventing progress in the talks, adding it was unacceptable to “impose this short, brief timeline, and at the same time not budge or make progress on some topics that are of importance to the EU”. “The UK cannot refuse to extend the transition, and at the same time slow down discussions on important areas,” Barnier said. Asked whether the EU could request an extension if the British did not, Barnier said it was not up to one side to be the “demandeur” (seeker), but it had to be a common decision for both parties before 30 June, as stated in the withdrawal agreement. “It’s too early from our side to express an opinion on this subject,” Barnier said, adding that the European commission would assess the situation in early June. The transition can be extended by up to one or two years by mutual agreement. Frost later tweeted: “If we are to make progress now, we need to focus on agreeing a future relationship that has a comprehensive [free trade agreement] at its core, like those the EU has agreed elsewhere. We support high standards. But there is no need for novel and unprecedented ‘level playing field’ rules, for example tying us to EU laws, or a role for the EU court. What the EU proposes is unlike anything agreed in other such FTAs and we will not agree to it here. “Finally, we are ready to work to agree a fisheries agreement which reflects our rights under international law to control our own waters, & provides for annual negotiations over access based on scientific principles. We won’t agree to continuing the Common Fisheries Policy.” The two negotiating teams have been conducting only the second full week of structured talks since the UK left the EU on 31 January. Barnier cited four areas where progress had been “disappointing”, including on a deal for future trade in goods. Barnier said the EU’s offer of zero-tariff, zero-quota access to its market in exchange for respecting social, environmental standards and state aid rules would give the UK unprecedented access to the European market. But he said the UK had “failed to engage substantially on this topic” and had even “denounced” the basic premise of fair competition. “It argued that our positions are too far to reach an agreement,” Barnier said. “It also denounced the basic premise that economic interconnectedness and geographic proximity require robust guarantees.” Throwing back the often-repeated words of British negotiators, Barnier noted the disparity in size between the two sides. “The UK negotiators keep repeating that we are negotiating as sovereign equals,” Barnier said. “That’s fine, but the reality of the negotiations is to find the best possible relationship between a market of 66 million consumers on the one side of the channel and the market of 450 million consumers on the other side. That is the reality.” Barnier added that devising such level playing field commitments had been agreed as a necessity “with Boris Johnson in our joint political declaration”, ratified at the time as the withdrawal agreement.
In response a UK spokesman said there would be no progress until “the EU drops its insistence on imposing conditions on the UK which are not found in the EU’s other trade agreements and which do not take account of the fact that we have left the EU as an independent state”. A second problem area, Barnier said, was the UK’s insistence that the future relationship should be made up of a series of separate agreements rather than a single deal with a single arrangement for ensuring compliance by both sides. A third area of “serious difficulty”, he continued, was the UK’s refusal to put into the future treaty that the UK will remain a signatory of the European convention on human rights or recognise the role of the European court of justice in protecting EU citizens’ data when flowing between the bloc and the UK. “This creates serious, serious limitations for our future security partnership,” he said. The UK has said it would be unprecedented for a deal to include a commitment to remain part of the ECHR. “We made no progress on fisheries,” Barnier said of a fourth problematic issue. “On this essential topic the UK has not put forward a legal text. We have made no tangible progress. Despite the political declaration stating that we should make our best endeavours to reach an agreement by July.” He added: “The EU will not agree to any future economic partnership that does not include the balanced, sustainable and long-term solution on fisheries,” Barnier said. “That should be crystal clear to the UK.” The UK spokesman warned that Brussels had to accept that the status quo of the common fisheries policy would not endure but that legal text setting out the British paper could emerge in the coming weeks to aid progress. “The EU’s mandate appears to require us to accept a continuance of the current quotas agreed under the common fisheries policy,” the spokesman said. “We will only be able to make progress here on the basis of the reality that the UK will have the right to control access to its waters at the end of this year.” The negotiations are scheduled to continue on 11 May."
2020-04-24T13:28:58Z,politics,Politics,No 10 casts doubt on imminent return to work for Boris Johnson,"Doubts have been cast on Boris Johnson’s rumoured return to frontline politics on Monday, with Downing Street saying he is yet to work on his “red box” of official papers as usual and is being guided by his medical team. However in a sign the prime minister is easing back into work, his official spokesman said he was regularly receiving updates to the coronavirus response and had calls with the first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, and the health secretary, Matt Hancock. On Johnson returning to frontline work next week, the spokesman said: “He is speaking with colleagues and he is receiving regular updates, but in terms of when he is actually able to get back to work in No 10, he will take the advice of his medical team on that. “He is receiving updates on the response and he has been taking part in the call with the president and had his audience with Her Majesty but he’s not doing red box in the usual way, no.” Donald Trump had said Johnson sounded “incredible” in a phone call with him following his discharge from hospital, sparking speculation the prime minister was set to return to work. The US president revealed details of their conversation at one of his regular press conferences in which he claimed Johnson, who was in intensive care with coronavirus earlier this month, sounded “ready to go”. A report in the Daily Telegraph suggested Johnson could return to work on Monday. He has been recuperating at Chequers after being released from hospital on 12 April.
The health secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme Johnson was “on the mend in a big way” but that his return to work was a matter for the doctors. Hancock described Johnson as “ebullient” while recovering at his country retreat, where he is said not to be doing official work. The prime minister is said to have told aides to start scheduling catch-up meetings with individual cabinet ministers next week as he retakes the reins of the UK’s coronavirus response, and he may chair the cabinet meeting himself. Raab, who is also foreign secretary, has been deputising for Johnson since he fell ill. This has involved him leading cabinet meetings as well as taking prime minister’s questions on Wednesday. According to the Telegraph, Johnson has spent the past week increasing his workload in anticipation of his return and has spoken to Raab on a daily basis. He is said to have been studying government papers and closely following parliamentary proceedings. The phone call with Trump involved a discussion on a UK-US trade deal. How the UK will leave the lockdown and the way that will be communicated to the public will be among of his most pressing issues.
Trump told reporters in the US: “He was ready to go. I am very surprised to tell you this. It’s like the old Boris. Tremendous energy, tremendous drive. He called me pretty close to when he got out the hospital. I think he’s doing great. He’s so sharp and energetic, pretty incredible. “He’s a friend of ours, a friend of mine.” Johnson told the public about his coronavirus diagnosis on 27 March and that he would isolate in his flat at No 11 Downing Street for a week. After seven days, No 10 said he would not be returning to frontline work as his temperature had persisted. On 5 April he was admitted to St Thomas’ hospital, where he was placed in intensive care on 7 April and treated with oxygen. He was released five days later."
2020-04-24T08:56:26Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock: online bookings key to hitting coronavirus tests target,"The UK health secretary has said a new online booking system will be key as the government scrambles to meet its 100,000 a day coronavirus testing target by the end of the month. The government announced a major expansion of eligibility for testing – less than a week before a self-imposed deadline – after it was criticised for a low uptake of tests, with the latest daily figure of 23,000 still less than half the total capacity, which has risen to 51,000. All key workers will be able to get a test if they or their employers request one, announced Matt Hancock, as he said widespread testing and tracing of those coming into contact with confirmed cases was the only way to ease physical distancing measures. The list includes NHS and social care workers, police officers, teachers, social workers, those in the justice system, undertakers, some in local government, supermarket and food production workers, journalists, transport workers and some people in utilities and IT. From today, those seeking a test will be able to register via a government website. Companies will also be able to book them for employees.
People who register will receive a text or email with an appointment at one of 48 drive-through centres or can request a home test kit. However, moments after the website went live on Friday morning all the home tests for key workers had already gone. A note on the government website said: “Currently, only drive-through tests available. We’ve issued today’s allocation of home test kits. If you need a home test kit, check back here tomorrow, when more will be available. You can continue if you’re able to visit a drive-through test centre.” Hancock said testing was “slow at the beginning of the month” but claimed the government was ahead of its plan to be able to test 100,000 people a day by May. “The reason why the increase was pretty slow at the start of the month is because we have been building these symptoms to automate the testing, automate the labs and the IT systems that are needed,” he told the BBC. “We are ahead of our internal plan for where we expected the amount of capacity to be and we have got a week left to hit that goal.”
Asked if he thought the 100,000 target would be met, he replied: “I do, yes, but nothing is guaranteed in life.” A help desk has been set up to aid the process, and 48 mobile units run by the army will travel around the country to where they are needed, such as care homes. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Hancock added: “Not as many people have been coming for [a test] as we had expected. Of course that was a problem but it’s a good problem because it means we’ve been able to expand who can get a test faster than we had planned. “They will start in small numbers but that service will grow, and I think that will be a popular service as it increasingly becomes available.”
The government also announced a contact tracing operation would be functioning in a “matter of weeks”. Eighteen thousand people, including 3,000 clinicians, will be recruited to work on contact tracing, supporting an NHS mobile phone app that will automatically log users’ contacts and warn them if they have been close to someone who tests positive. Hancock said these steps would be crucial to holding down the rate and level of transmission of the disease. “They work far better when there are fewer new cases but, if they work as they have done in other countries, then they will be able to hold down the number of new cases with fewer social distancing restrictions, which is why they are so important to get in place in large scale.”"
2020-04-24T05:05:15Z,politics,Politics,Brexit talks: who is involved and what is being covered?,"Brexit talks on the future relationship between the UK and the EU resumed this week after a six-week interruption caused by coronavirus. Over five days and 40 video sessions, 10 negotiating teams were expected to provide an urgent “refocus” before the 30 June deadline for both sides to formally agree to extend the transition period if the UK asks for one. Michel Barnier, the EU’s lead negotiator, will host a press conference at noon on Friday in Brussels to give updates, but his team were told on Monday that Boris Johnson was not budging on the issue of the extensions. Barnier’s opposite number, David Frost, opened the first plenary session by “reiterating the government wish not to extend the transition period and that the job could be done by the end of the year”. Some observers said the UK government’s position that an extension is not necessary was astonishing given the depth of the coronavirus crisis. Philip Rycroft, a former chief civil servant at the now defunct Brexit department, told Prospect magazine: “It is simple common sense to ask for an extension of the transition period.” Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform thinktank, believes an extension is inevitable but Johnson has “no incentive” to seek one until June, the deadline for a one-off UK request. “A free-trade agreement could still be agreed but it would be hard to implement. Even if we were coming to the end of this pandemic by then, businesses will be not be prepared,” said Lowe, who described himself as optimistic that a free-trade deal could be done by the end of the year, albeit a poor one. This week’s talks centred solely on the future relationship. A separate strand of work is under way on the implementation of the withdrawal agreement signed off in January. Here is an overview of who is involved in the discussions and what areas are covered. Joint committee Featuring Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Maroš Šefčovič, a European commission vice-president, the committee met for the first time on 30 March and will make decisions on recommendations made by civil servants who will staff six specialised committees. Those committees cover the Northern Ireland protocol; citizens’ rights; British sovereign army bases in Cyprus, the divorce bill, Gibraltar and “other separation issues”. Who is on the committees, how often they will meet and precisely what they will be exploring has yet to be disclosed. Northern Ireland checks The Ireland Northern Ireland specialised committee (INISC) will meet for the first time on 30 April. The Cabinet Office has confirmed that the INISC will be “comprised of official-level representatives of the EU and the UK” and will “meet as regularly as required to facilitate engagement between the UK and the EU on protocol implementation”. A working group will also be set up to feed into the committee. TheCabinet Office says it will act “as a forum for the exchange of information and mutual consultation” on implementation. So expect industry bodies and experts to be asked to submit to this group. The remaining specialised committees have not yet been scheduled. Thomas Lieflaender, the deputy head of the European Commission’s Brexit task force, is being tipped to lead the INISC along with a senior figure from the Northern Ireland office, possibly Andrew McCormick, the executive’s director general of international relations. One concern is that civil servants cannot make decisions on politically charged issues such as what checks will be conducted and where. Jess Sargeant, a researcher at the Institute for Government thinktank, said the INISC was likely to make recommendations to the joint committee. One urgent task is to look at what goods will be subject to tariffs when crossing the Irish Sea using data on trade journeys and the goods “at risk” of entering the single market by crossing the border into the Republic of Ireland. Border inspection posts The location of border inspection posts for controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea has yet to be decided, unsurprisingly given Johnson has insisted there would be no checks. The EU would prefer posts to be located in places such as the ports of Liverpool and Cairnryan in Scotland. Fisheries This is one of the most contentious areas and the EU has said there will be no deal unless agreed in outline by June. The chances of progress in this week’s talks have been hampered by the failure of the UK to issue a legal text giving detail to how it envisages its new status as an independent coastal state to work. The EU issued text for all areas but the UK issued a partial text. “This means the text the negotiating teams will be discussing is the EU’s text, not the UK’s,” a source said. Customs Gove told parliament as recently as February that the UK needed an army of 50,000 customs agents to deal with cross-border trade from January 2021. It seem unlikely much progress has been made here. Immigration The immigration bill, which would have closed the borders to low-paid unskilled workers from January, has been shelved, the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, announced this week. Few believe the government can forge ahead with a change of public attitude to foreign low-paid workers in social care, health, retail and agriculture. Hauliers The Road Haulage Association has called for the transition period to be extended. It says the industry is on life support. “We are totally focused on coronavirus and our position is there is a real need for a delay to Brexit talks. Our industry is struggling to survive with more than 70% saying they face going to the wall within 12 weeks,” said Rod McKenzie, head of policy and public affairs. He said a survey of 4,500 hauliers found half of drivers were inactive and 50% of trucks parked up."
2020-04-23T19:55:31Z,politics,Politics,Maybe Matt Hancock should stick to loaves and fishes | John Crace,"It’s been a rough few weeks for Matt Hancock. First, he got coronavirus, and almost certainly came back to work far sooner than was good for him. Next, he was just about the only minister prepared to do more than mutter platitudes and put his neck on the line with a target of 100,000 tests per day. Then he discovered he was being set up as the fall guy for the inevitable public inquiry following a series of off-the-record briefings by Classic Dom. So it’s no wonder Hancock now looks totally done in. All his old Tigger bounce and enthusiasm has gone: he is the Duracell bunny left to run on fumes, barely able to put one foot in front of the other. He has also aged visibly. Where there used to be a child-like polished sheen, there are now traces of lines on his face. Give it another week and he’ll have to hand in his student railcard. Yet on and on he goes. On Tuesday he was put in charge of the daily press briefing, on Wednesday he had to do a 45-minute ministerial statement in the Commons, and then here he was back in Downing Street on Thursday to front up the government’s daily press conference again. While many other ministers have gone missing for much of the past two months – TV box sets to watch, nails to paint – Matt has consistently turned up for work. There’s no doubt about how much he cares: I just wonder how much longer he can sustain it. His problem is that integrity and competence don’t always go hand in hand. Because there seldom seems to be any correlation between what he says and what actually takes place. “We now have the capacity to do 51,000 tests per day,” he said, blithely brushing past the fact that the actual number of daily tests taking place was about 20,000. That’s another 80,000 a day to reach by this time next week. Talk of capacity has long since stopped fooling people. Hancock, though, is still waiting on a miracle. Having insisted that all NHS staff and social care workers could already get tests – something that will be news to the many hundreds of thousands who have found themselves unable to get the tests they need – Matt went truly exponential. Now, he declared, 10 million key workers and their families would also be able to get tested on demand. All they had to do was make an appointment to turn up at one of the testing centres and all would be well. Not even Jesus committed himself to that level of promise. He just stuck to loaves and fishes.
The new key strategy was test, track and trace. Quite why it has taken the UK government so long to come round to the regime that has proved so effective for South Korea and Germany was left unsaid. The thought occurred that the health secretary may have been playing a long game here. By effectively admitting that the UK had been hopelessly behind the curve in its response to the coronavirus crisis – Brexit to celebrate, Boris’s domestic arrangements to be smoothed over – Matt was implicitly dobbing in all his cabinet colleagues. If he was going down, he was going to take as many as he could with him. There was a general air of disbelief about the chances of a proper “test, track and trace” strategy being implemented any time soon – we’ll believe it when we see it – so most questions focused on how any relaxation of lockdown regulations would take place. “I understand the thirst for knowledge,” Matt said. But it wasn’t a thirst he shared. Maybe he’s just too knackered to be that inquisitive right now. So he wasn’t going to bother to answer the question. Nor was he going to make the mistake of allowing any journalists to have a follow-up to ask why he hadn’t answered their original question. He couldn’t imagine which minister had been daft enough to introduce supplementaries in the first place. Just as well, because it had been him. The longer the briefing went on, the more visibly tired Hancock became. If any of his cabinet colleagues really gave a toss about his wellbeing they would tell him to take a week off. But they don’t. They need him to fail so they don’t have to. So Matt merely plodded on, repeating many of the old familiar lines we’ve heard at every press conference while trying to talk up “test, track and trace” from wish fulfilment to reality. It can’t be long before the health secretary starts talking about how we have the capacity to “test, track and trace” with the real problem being all those key workers failing to take advantage of the scheme. “We have always followed the science,” said Hancock, resorting to the one government mantra that really has been tested, tracked and traced. The two scientists, Sir Patrick Vallance and Prof John Newton, were both alive to the danger. They too have realised they are being lined up as potential scapegoats for the clusterfuck. “Actually, we just supply the evidence,” they corrected Hancock. “The decisions are taken by the government.” Things are going to get a lot uglier before life improves. And not just in Downing Street."

Head over to our our global liveblog to keep up with the latest developments from around the world.
2020-04-23T18:51:02Z,politics,Politics,Swift inquiry agreed into leak of Labour report on handling anti-Semitism,"An investigation into a leaked Labour document which made explosive allegations about the party’s handling of anti-Semitism claims is aiming for a swift conclusion, Labour has said. On Thursday, a meeting of Labour’s ruling body set out a timescale, with the investigation aiming to conclude in July, and drew up its terms of reference. The inquiry will look into the leaking of the 860-page report that reignited divisions as the new leader, Sir Keir Starmer, tries to unite the party. The report claimed anti-Jeremy Corbyn sentiment among Labour staff hindered efforts to tackle the issue within the party. Critics of the report, some of whom are on the right of the party, say it was leaked in an attempt to “smear whistleblowers” who had exposed antisemitism. The meeting will be closely scrutinised because it is the first held by Labour’s national executive committee (NEC) under Starmer, whose supporters could push through structural changes to the party. Starmer promised an independent inquiry into the contents of the report and how it was leaked after it became public over the Easter weekend. It is understood that the NEC agreed that the investigation should strive to deliver its report by mid-July. The terms of reference are expected to be published soon. Momentum, the grassroots organisation set up to support Corbyn, which has several supporters among NEC members, said Starmer had told the meeting that disciplinary action could be brought against people named in the report who had broken the rules. “We welcome Keir Starmer’s commitment to disciplinary action,” a Momentum spokesperson said. “Ordinary members would rightly face disciplinary action if they engaged in such activity, senior staff members should be held to even higher standards.” A Labour party spokesperson said: “The National Executive Committee has today agreed the terms of reference for the independent investigation into the circumstances, contents and release of an internal report. “The NEC will meet again in due course to agree the individuals who will be appointed to lead the investigation.”"
2020-04-23T18:38:38Z,politics,Politics,Coronavirus tests to be offered to key workers and families in England,"Testing for coronavirus is to be made available to millions of key workers and their families in England, with appointments to be booked online, the health secretary has announced. The system, unveiled at Downing Street’s daily press conference, involves a dramatic expansion of the people who can be tested for the virus, as the government continues to try to reach its target of 100,000 daily tests by the end of April. The government estimates that there are 10 million key workers in the UK who will be eligible for the swab test, which has previously been available only to health workers. The tests will also be offered to the families of key workers, and it is expected that the devolved administrations will follow suit.
The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “We can make it easier, faster and simpler for any essential worker in England who needs a test to get a test. “Any essential workers who need a test will be able to book an appointment on gov.uk themselves directly. This applies for people in essential workers’ households too, who need a test. It’s all part of getting Britain back on her feet.”
The main focus for tests, available from Friday, will be the antigen variety, which tells people whether they currently have the illness. Antigen swab testing can show medics what treatment a patient should receive and who should isolate and who is able to return to work. An antibody blood test showing whether someone has had the illness in the past, which some have argued is more useful, will be used by the government in its forthcoming survey of the disease. The government has so far been under fire for setting an ambitious target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, while drive-through testing facilities have been shown to be underused and difficult for care workers to access if they do not own a car. Capacity currently stands at 51,000 tests a day. In the last 24 hours, 23,560 tests were carried out on 14,629 people. Professor John Newton, director of health improvement at Public Health England, who is coordinating testing, told the press conference that the government was on track to meet its 100,000 target. Contact tracing will be rolled out on a “large scale” with a new NHS app, Hancock said. If you are unwell, you can inform the app, which can let other people with it downloaded know that they have recently been in contact with someone with suspected coronavirus. To “kickstart” tracing, the government will hire 18,000 people, including 3,000 clinicians and public health experts, who will be trained over the coming weeks. The range of jobs classed as essential is extensive, and includes teachers and support staff, people in the justice system, charities, workers delivering key frontline services, transport workers and those working for local government. The process is free and results will be sent out by text, with a helpdesk set up to deal with queries. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said Labour had consistently asked for a testing and tracing strategy. He said: “It is crucial that greater numbers of critical workers such as care staff are now able to access testing. “We will continue to hold the government to account for the promise it has made of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month.” Teaching unions and school leaders have welcomed the announcement that school staff will be able to access coronavirus testing, with some calling it an essential precondition before schools are reopened. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “School staff have been on the frontline in the national response to coronavirus. We have been clear from the start that governments across the UK understand they must honour this effort with the appropriate level of support and safety.
“If testing can be delivered effectively, then it will be welcomed by the education sector.” Kevin Courtney of the National Education Union said the immediate priority was for teachers who were self-isolating to get tested, and that so far the government had been slow to respond. The number of drive-through test centres will increase from 30 to 48 and the army will run 48 mobile testing units, which will be used to target care homes."
2020-04-23T18:32:02Z,politics,Politics,Coronavirus tests: who qualifies for them now – and how do I apply?,"The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has expanded the criteria for who qualifies for a free test for coronavirus, so who will this include and how will the ramped-up testing regime work? Why is testing being expanded now? Hancock is desperate to meet a target for testing 100,000 people per day by Thursday 30 April but appears a long way off achieving that. On Wednesday there were only 23,560 tests, still below an interim target of 25,000 tests by the middle of April. The 100,000 target has been dismissed as arbitrary and overambitious, but Hancock is determined to meet it. He claims the criteria can be expanded because there is now greater capacity for testing but too few people have been coming forward for tests. These would be tests for whether people currently have the virus, not antibody tests to show if people have previously been infected. Is there capacity to test 100,000 people a day? Not yet, but Hancock claims the government is on course to meet the target in terms of capacity, if not the tests themselves. On Thursday he said capacity had increased overnight from 40,000 to 51,000 tests, which he claimed was ahead of schedule. Will more than 100,000 tests eventually be available? Yes, according to Hancock. “Our ultimate goal is that everyone who could benefit from a test gets a test,” he said. Who previously qualified for a test? Initially only patients in hospital could get tests. When Hancock pledged the 100,000 target by the end of April, he also announced plans to test NHS staff. Later he broadened the criteria to include care home staff. Who now qualifies for tests? Up to 10 million essential workers and their families in England who are showing symptoms of coronavirus. The list of essential workers is the same as the one used to allow the children of key workers to carry on going to school during the lockdown. In addition to health and social care staff, the list includes teachers, judges, some lawyers, religious staff, and journalists providing public service broadcasting. Also included are local civil servants, police, armed service personnel, fire and rescue service staff, immigration officers and prison and probation staff. Some private-sector staff also qualify including vets, those in food production, essential financial services and information technology, as well as those working in the oil, gas, electricity and water sectors. How do you apply? Employers of essential workers will be able to apply on the government’s website to get a test for any of their staff. From Friday any essential workers who need a test will be able to book an appointment on the website themselves. Hancock said: “This also applies for people in essential workers’ households too who need a test.”
What happens after you apply? After entering your details on the government website, essential workers will then get a text or an email inviting them for an appointment. After taking a test, results will be sent out by text or email within about two days. Those testing positive with mild symptoms will be expected to follow the government’s isolation guidelines. Where will tests take place? There are regional test sites in around 30 locations across England, with more planned. The army will be providing mobile testing sites in more remote areas. And Hancock also promised home testing kits."
2020-04-23T18:18:06Z,politics,Politics,Scientists criticise UK government's 'following the science' claim,"Experts have voiced growing frustration over the UK government’s claim that it is “following the science”, saying the refrain is being used to abdicate responsibility for political decisions. They also raised concerns that the views of public health experts were being overlooked, with disproportionate weight given to the views of modellers. “As a scientist, I hope I never again hear the phrase ‘based on the best science and evidence’ spoken by a politician,” Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, told the Guardian. “This phrase has become basically meaningless and used to explain anything and everything.” The government has repeatedly said it is being “led by the science” on decisions ranging from banning mass gatherings to closing schools, the use of face masks and, most recently, the prospects of lifting the lockdown. However, Sridhar and others argued that scientific views on these topics could be wide-ranging and dependent on a scientist’s field of expertise. The diversity of scientific views was apparent in March when case numbers were rising rapidly but the government chose not to ban mass gatherings or introduce wide-reaching physical distancing. “World Health Organization advice, and what we’ve learned from lots of previous outbreaks in low- and middle-income countries, is that the faster you move at the start, the better, because it’s exponential growth,” Sridhar said. “In public health, a test, trace and isolate campaign would’ve been where your mind first went.” Instead, she said, the government appeared to be basing policy on the presumption of a binary choice between two scenarios, played out in computer models, of either eradicating the virus or it becoming endemic.
Prof Mark Woolhouse, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, said modelling had had a disproportionate influence. “I do think scientific advice is driven far too much by epidemiology – and I’m an epidemiologist. “What we’re not talking about in the same formal, quantitative way are the economic costs, the social costs, the psychological costs of being under lockdown,” he said. “I understand that the government is being advised by economists, psychiatrists and others, but we’re not seeing what that science is telling them. I find that very puzzling.” Woolhouse said that while it was understandable that saving lives was the top priority, the idea of doing this at any cost was naive. “With any disease there is a trade-off. Public health is largely about that trade-off. What’s happening here is that both sides of the equation are so enormous and so damaging that the routine public health challenge of balancing costs and benefits is thrown into incredibly stark relief. Yet that balance has to be found.” Others expressed concern about the lack of transparency around the evidence affecting decision-making. “We don’t know who sits on Sage [the government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies], we see very little of the papers that go to Sage,” said Prof Sheila Bird, the former programme leader of the Medical Research Council’s biostatistics unit at the University of Cambridge. “That scientific underpinning is not evident.” Sridhar said the failure to fully consider the perspectives of experts beyond epidemiology may have contributed to misguided decisions. Models appear not to have factored in the role of hospital staff shortages, which may have diverted attention from the urgent need for adequate personal protective equipment, she said. The concept of shielding the most vulnerable “looks beautiful” in models, she said, but in reality care homes are facing major outbreaks and multigenerational households are struggling to isolate the vulnerable. “You can’t take these people out of the system and isolate them as if they were a data point on a graph,” she said. “There’s a real problem if you have a collection of people from the same background, the same field, the same institutions; that can lead to blindspots and groupthink,” Sridhar added. “Diversity is clearly important for better decision-making.”
Some fear the prominence given to science in supporting political decisions risks burdening scientists with unrealistic expectations and could ultimately erode trust in their expertise. “The government isn’t using expertise simply to validate claims, it also appears to be using it as an insurance policy,” Prof Christina Boswell, a political scientist at the University of Edinburgh, wrote this week. “If things go wrong – and the curve gets too steep – it will be the scientific advice that is to blame.” Who’s who: the experts Prof Chris Whitty: the truthteller Chief medical officers have a tradition of speaking their mind, often to the chagrin of governments. Whitty, however, has appeared to be in perfect harmony with the UK government at the Downing Street briefings on Covid-19. The reality is probably that ministers are in step with him – or even a step behind. On Wednesday, Whitty, a practising NHS consultant physician, told a starker truth than politicians have dared: that physial distancing needs to be in place until at least the end of the year. Sir Patrick Vallance: the political naif Vallance has had a career in medicine at University College London and St George’s, University of London, researching vascular biology and endothelial cell physiology, and also in the pharmaceutical industry. From 2012 to 2018, he was president of research and development at GlaxoSmithKline, where, unusually for the industry, he advocated greater openness about innovation and partnerships with other companies. He left to become the government’s chief scientific adviser, but is not an instinctive politician. He was partly blamed for the government’s flirtation with the notion of herd immunity, saying in March that the strategy was to reduce the peak, not suppress it completely. “Also, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease.” Afterwards it was denied he meant herd immunity should be the goal; it was simply an outcome. Neil Ferguson: the workaholic Ferguson leads the modelling behind the UK response through the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, which he founded with colleagues at Imperial College. He has a long history in modelling epidemics, originally with Roy Anderson’s unit at Oxford University, where they worked on BSE, vCJD, foot and mouth, Sars and swine flu – sometimes attracting controversy.
Ferguson is a mathematician, an epidemiologist and a workaholic who, before the lockdown, moved seamlessly between Downing Street, university and press briefings. Even while recovering from Covid-19 himself, he gave evidence to MPs and did interviews. His team’s work is at the heart of the lockdown strategy, predicting the numbers of deaths it will save. Dr Jenny Harries: the ‘national treasure’
The deputy chief medical officer has been called a “national treasure” by Vogue, which may reflect the fact she is a rarity – a woman on the Downing Street briefings podium. With degrees in pharmacology and medicine, she joined Public Health England in 2013. Like her boss, Whitty, she is independent-minded, and she warned at the end of March that the lockdown could last for six months or longer. She also suggested couples living separately could “test the strength of their relationship” during the lockdown by moving in together. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam: the flu expert
Jonathan Stafford Nguyen Van-Tam is a widely published expert on influenza and the vaccines and antiviral drugs used to treat it. Now one of the government’s two deputy chief medical officers, he is regularly deferred to by Hancock. He spent four years in the pharmaceutical industry before returning to the public sector to head the pandemic influenza office of the Health Protection Agency, which is now part of Public Health England, and was a member of Sage during the 2009-10 swine flu pandemic. His grandfather Nguyễn văn Tâm was the prime minister of Vietnam in 1952. Prof Stephen Powis: the NHS’s defender
A kidney specialist, Powis is a professor of renal medicine at UCL and was the medical director of the Royal Free hospital until 2018. Now the medical director of NHS England, his job is to defend it against the threat of Covid-19. As such, his comments at Downing Street briefings have not always stuck to the medical need. With Michael Gove on 4 April, he criticised people sabotaging 5G phone masts under the illusion they were implicated in the spread of the virus. “I’m absolutely outraged, absolutely disgusted, that people would be taking action against the very infrastructure that we need to respond to this health emergency,” he said."
2020-04-23T17:22:36Z,politics,Politics,Senior Tories urge government to reveal plans on easing UK lockdown,"Growing numbers of senior Tories are ramping up pressure on the government to provide details of how the lockdown could be eased, saying “the time is now” to give the public more information. Influential Conservatives, including former ministers, have said No 10 needs to be more transparent with the public and businesses on potential exit strategies and must deliver a statement on the issue soon. Nicola Sturgeon used her daily press conference on Thursday to explain how Scotland might lift restrictions on some businesses and allow pupils to return to school. Northern Ireland’s first minister, Arlene Foster, has also suggested she could lift restrictions before England. Iain Duncan Smith, the former leader of the Conservative party, told the Guardian on Thursday: “The UK government now needs to recognise that the time is now. They need to bite the bullet and do it.” The government has so far said it does not want to give details of how the country might come out of the lockdown because it might lead to people no longer obeying the rules.
Duncan Smith said: “My concern is that people are already beginning to do that. I’ve already noticed shops opening. I think they need to explain that we are not ready to come out yet but when we are, this is what’s going to happen.” He said Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was wrong to think that the government would lose control of restrictions by giving the public more information. Talks were going on within government privately on the way out of a lockdown, he suggested, and it was essential this was conveyed to the public as soon as possible. Theresa Villiers, the former environment secretary, said government advisers now needed to come forward with more details of what they perceived to be the exit route. She said: “We need a roadmap for a release from lockdown. I’m of course not saying that we should dispense with the advice of scientists and medics, but I think that ministers need to be more transparent now about how we will get to the point where the lockdown can be lifted because we need to give that hope to businesses who have been severely impacted by the crisis. “There is a case for a more transparent approach on all of this. I think the time has come where we need a clear signal about how and when we are going to return to a degree of normality.”
Charles Walker, the vice-chair of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, said the government had not got its strategy wrong yet but “it’s got more to do to get it right”. Most prescient was bringing business leaders into the debate, he said. “It’s time to make them part of the conversation. Now is the time. That doesn’t mean ending lockdown tomorrow, but businesses need reassurance. The economy is lives – it’s not mutually exclusive.” The justice select committee chair, Bob Neill, said Boris Johnson should deliver the message himself when he has recovered from the coronavirus. He said while he remained concerned about a second wave of infection should restrictions be lifted, it was an appropriate time to have the discussion. “There comes a limit to people’s tolerance. People will go along with things if they know where we are. Ultimately scientists and medics are there to advise, but these are policy decisions so ultimately that means politicians are accountable and have to take that decision on board. Hopefully Boris Johnson will be back in the harness by then.” Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a backbencher, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that he believed garden centres and DIY stores could be reopened with physical distancing measures. He said he accepted that opening up the country again could risk infection but businesses desperately needed support or could cease trading. “I think on behalf of the businesses of this country, begin to give them a little bit of hope as to when we might be able to get back to normality.”"
2020-04-23T16:28:31Z,politics,Politics,Scots must accept life alongside Covid-19 as new normal – Sturgeon,"Scotland must establish a new normal of “living alongside” coronavirus, Nicola Sturgeon has said, as the Scottish government published its plan for moving beyond current restrictions, presenting a future cycle of lockdown being lifted and then reimposed “with little notice”, potentially until a vaccine has been found. Announcing daily data indicating a continuing drop in hospital admissions and intensive care cases, Sturgeon on Thursday urged the Scottish public to read and respond to the 26-page document, which stresses that Scotland may break with the current “four nations approach” if expert advice recommends this. Within five hours of being posted online, the PDF of the document had been accessed 170,000 times, the Scottish government later confirmed. The document places testing, tracing and isolation at the heart of the continuing strategy, and emphasises the need for innovative approaches to continued physical distancing as well as “unprecedented” public compliance. It states: “If, after easing any restrictions, the evidence tells us we are unable to contain the transmission of the virus, then we will have to reimpose them, possibly returning to lockdown with little notice. While we will do our best to avoid this, it is possible that such a cycle may happen more than once until we reach a point when we have in place an effective vaccine.”
Sturgeon said the lifting of the lockdown was not “a flick of a switch”, and physical distancing and limited contact with others was likely to continue “for the rest of the year and maybe beyond”. She said group gatherings, for example in pubs or at public events, were likely to be banned or restricted for some months to come, and some form of shielding would be required for the foreseeable future as well as “stronger surveillance for those coming into the country”. The first minister also raised the prospect of redesigning workplaces and schools to allow people to remain two metres apart, with the possibility of some groups of pupils returning before others or on different days of the week. Asked whether these long-term restrictions were likely to affect family Christmas celebrations, Sturgeon said: “I’m not cancelling Christmas. Christmas is still a quite a long way away – I know it comes round quicker every year. It may happen slightly differently depending on where we are, but we will take these things in a calm, considered way.”
The document says the Scottish government will assess easing restrictions for specific geographies and sectors, for example parts of the rural economy. This would happen only if it did not undermine the “simplicity of the message”, Sturgeon said. It likewise drives home the importance of stabilising below 1.0 the virus’s reproduction number (R0), which indicates how many new cases one infected person generates, and ensuring that the impact of any easing of restrictions did not raise the number above that figure. Sturgeon said when the lockdown began, Scotland’s R0 was above 3, while the best estimates suggested it was now between 0.6 to 1. She said the continuing uncertainty over the infection rate was part of the reason why she was not lifting restrictions immediately. Scotland’s interim chief medical officer, Dr Gregor Smith, also would not specify an exact figure he wanted to see the number stabilise at, saying that in principle it should be “as low as possible”. The document also raises the prospect of using digital tools to assist contact tracing, and while it does not directly refer to the controversial approach of “herd immunity”, it says there is no such thing as “acceptable loss”, adding: “We are clear that an assumption that there is a proportion or section of the population that it is safe or acceptable to allow to be infected forms no part of the Scottish government’s policy or approach.” While the document is clear that Scotland could take a different path from the rest of the UK if the science requires it, Sturgeon said: “Most of what I’m talking about today I want to do on a UK-wide basis as far as it makes sense, but I have a responsibility as first minster to use the powers I have in a way that is right for Scotland.” No 10 said there was no indication so far that the four nation approach was crumbling. Boris Johnson’s spokesman said: “As far as I’m aware, the Scottish government have stressed they want to continue to operate within the four nations UK framework and align any decisions which are taken as far as possible. That is obviously the approach of ourselves.” The Scottish Conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw, said any divergence from the four nations strategy on ending the lockdown would require compelling evidence, “in the interests of ensuring clear and consistent advice to the public”. In contrast, the Scottish Greens co-convenor Patrick Harvie said he welcomed the “recognition that a one-size-fits-all exit strategy for the UK was inappropriate”, but he said far more detail was needed on plans for an effective testing, tracing and isolation strategy, “especially when Scotland is not using the testing capacity it currently has”."
2020-04-23T16:24:59Z,politics,Politics,Coronavirus: what would a year of physical distancing mean for the UK?,"The public have been warned to brace themselves for another year of physical distancing measures, with the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, saying it is time to be realistic about what lies ahead. But what would a new normal of physical distancing look like? Sector by sector Construction and manufacturing are likely to be at the forefront of a phased return that would be based on a traffic-light system, particularly given the pressure from Conservative MPs. The government recently issued guidance saying such work could continue if done in line with physical distancing rules “wherever possible”. Shops could return next, subject to reduced opening hours and strict rules on customer numbers at any one time, , including DIY retailers and garden centres, plus hairdressers. In terms of non-essential services, they could be followed by restaurants and pub, though again with physical distancing on tables and a cap on customer numbers. Last to come back would be arts and culture, including cinemas and theatres, while Premier League football matches would initially be played behind closed doors, perhaps with some screened on free-to-air TV. The National Theatre is hoping to reopen in July while planning for scenarios that might push it back as late as January or beyond. The shielded The government said in March it would be contacting 1.5 million people to tell them they should be “shielding” on account of being at a higher risk due to factors such as their age or underlying health conditions. That number could grow. The increase would be driven by information provided by GPs tasked with finding out more about other patients. If such groups have to confine themselves to their homes for another year, or until a vaccine is ready, then enhancements are likely to be made to processes including the employment of an army of volunteers and online delivery systems.
Generational divide One approach that has been discussed by policymakers, and proposed by researchers such as those at Warwick University, involves a youth-first policy allowing for younger worker in their 20s and 30s who no longer live with their parents to return to work first. While younger groups are not impervious to Covid-19, they are regarded as the most resilient. Such an approach has led some to joke there could even be a maximum drinking age in the bars that might open at the same time. By contrast, vulnerable and older people – specifically those aged above 70 – might have to remain in their homes for at least another year or until a vaccine is developed. Back to school While there is a case for reopening smaller schools first, one proposal is for secondary schools and above to open initially, as older students would be more likely – in theory – to abide by physical distancing and travel by themselves. In England the most likely are years 10 and 12 - the first years of GCSE and A-levels respectively. In terms of primaries, one idea floating around government is that year 6 – comprising 10- and 11-year-olds – could be allowed back. Other proposed measures include staggering opening times, capping numbers and hours, altering term times and providing protective equipment for staff in some instances. Imposing measures Britons have not been ordered to wear masks in public, although this could become more commonplace if mayors including London’s Sadiq Khan continue to back the measure. But it appears other measures, including floor markings inside and outside supermarkets, are here to stay and may well be expanded. Temperature screening, of the type that customers in China’s shops and travellers at some international airports have become used to, could also appear. A concept that could gain traction again is that of immunity passports for people who have antibodies after previously contracting coronavirus. But this is complicated, not least by problems with testing, unsettled science around immunity and fears some may want to become deliberately infected. Amid an unprecedented global surge in digital surveillance, many might also be concerned by steps towards tracking of the type credited in South Korea with helping to suppress the pandemic there at an early stage. An NHS app is being tested that would allow people to report their symptoms and then anonymously alert other users that have been in contact with that person in recent days."
2020-04-23T15:43:41Z,politics,Politics,"UK voter ID plan disenfranchises the poor, appeal court told","Pilot schemes requiring voters to produce photo ID at polling stations disenfranchise those who do not have or cannot find their documents and alienate people from the democratic process, the court of appeal has been told. The claim has been made by Neil Coughlan, a community activist from Braintree in Essex, who argues that voter fraud is extremely rare and the electoral trials are unlawful. In a hearing conducted remotely on Thursday, lawyers for Coughlan told Lord Justice Underhill, Lord Justice Mccombe and Lord Justice Green that many people did not have the type of photo ID required at a few polling stations in last May’s local elections. Anthony Peto QC, appearing for Coughlan, said the scheme was “a major constitutional change in the exercise of a fundamental democratic right”. He said Coughlan lives in a part of Essex that “he describes as run-down and neglected”. Peto added: “He feels that this [scheme] will serve to disenfranchise the poor who already feel [ignored] and where many people do not have photo IDs.” There was little evidence of voter fraud and personation taking place in the UK outside of Northern Ireland, the court was told. A survey last year found that more than 99% of polling station officials said they had no suspicions of anyone impersonating someone else in order to steal their vote. Peto said ministerial orders under which the pilot schemes were given the go-ahead were not made legitimately under the Representation of the People Act 2000. Section 10 of the act gives a minister power to introduce pilots “as regards when, where and how voting at elections is to take place”, the court was told. “By empowering the minister to make changes ‘as regards how voting is to take place’,” the court was told, “parliament cannot have intended to empower ministers effectively to disenfranchise a section of legitimate voters who would be unable to find and produce specified documents or who would be unable to satisfy local officials on the spot as to their entitlement to vote”. Coughlan is appealing against the high court’s rejection of his claim. Lawyers for the Cabinet Office told the appeal court judges that the purpose of the electoral trials was to discover what problems might arise and that they were lawful. Before the hearing, Coughlan, who has raised money for his case through a crowdfunding website, said: “Hundreds of individuals were denied their vote in last year’s local elections because of these voter ID pilots … I am determined to persevere with my case arguing that the pilots were unlawful as they needed an act of parliament to be introduced. “As the government moves to bring forward legislation to introduce voter ID requirements nationally at general elections, it is all the more important to establish whether these pilots were lawful. “As the Windrush scandal showed, many British citizens do not have official documentation and in fact some 7.5% of the electorate do not possess photo ID. Requiring individuals to produce identity documents is going to deprive legitimate members of the electorate of the vote and I believe it will disproportionately affect the poor and marginalised members of our society.” Tessa Gregory, a solicitor at the law firm Leigh Day who represents Coughlan, said: “Mr Coughlan contends that by giving ministers the power to make changes as to ‘how’ voting takes place, parliament cannot have intended them to disenfranchise those voters who cannot produce the correct form of ID at the polling station. “In his legal case he argues that restricting people’s right to vote in local elections by requiring them to produce ID is an important constitutional matter that has to be expressly authorised by parliament.” The hearing continues. Judgment is expected to be reserved."
2020-04-22T20:08:39Z,politics,Politics,UK government accused of cover-up over EU scheme to buy PPE,"Ministers are being pressed to reveal the full details of how the government missed out on four opportunities to join an EU medical supplies consortium, in the wake of a U-turn by the top civil servant in the Foreign Office over comments suggesting it was a “political decision”. The Labour MP Chris Bryant, who sits on the foreign affairs select committee, said on Wednesday that he “feared the government was involved in a full-on cover-up” over how it came to miss out on four rounds of procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators and laboratory supplies launched by the EU in late February and March. UK officials failed to take up an invitation to join the steering committee of participating countries that issues orders for medical equipment until 19 March – after the bulk purchases had been made. Bryant said he feared either Foreign Office ministers or the prime minister decided not to be associated with any EU scheme for political reasons “even though it was patently in the interests of the NHS and its staff to explore every possible avenue to acquire masks, gowns and ventilator equipment, as fast and most effectively as possible”. His intervention came a day after the Foreign Office’s permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, told MPs that ministers had indeed taken a political decision not to join the scheme.
After his claims, made to the foreign affairs committee on Tuesday, were later denied by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, McDonald wrote to the committee that night saying his original statement of a political motive was wrong and “owing to an initial communication problem the UK did not receive an invitation in time to join”. However, Bryant, in a view shared by some fellow committee members, senses that in his letter McDonald was limiting his retraction to the advice given to ministers about the EU ventilator scheme, but not to other EU medical product purchase schemes. Bryant has written to the committee chair, Tom Tugendhat, asking him to seek from the Foreign Office details of British representation at EU meetings held on 31 January, 4 February, 2 March and 13 March “at which EU-wide health security issues arising from coronavirus were discussed and the bulk procurement of masks, gowns, ventilators and other laboratory equipment were discussed”. He is also asking to see the briefing notes after these meetings, and the list of recipients in Whitehall to which any such notes were circulated. Bryant contends that McDonald was being asked by the committee about four rounds of EU procurement schemes launched in February and March, but in his letter to the committee correcting what he told the MPs McDonald appeared only to be referring to the EU ventilator scheme. Bryant then demands to know whether ministers were briefed about the other schemes. Hancock faced further pressure over the protection offered to NHS staff after the European commission said the UK had been given “ample opportunity” to join the EU scheme bulk-buying masks, gowns, gloves and goggles. After a day of confusion in Westminster over the UK’s lack of involvement in the EU’s joint procurement of equipment, a spokesman for the commission appeared to bolster the claim that ministers had taken a “political decision” to opt out. The commission spokesman said UK representatives had been briefed on the EU plans throughout February and March when they could have signed up for the huge purchases of ventilators, laboratory supplies and PPE. UK officials and ministers have repeatedly said the government only failed to take part in the schemes because of a communication problem linked to missed emails. The commission spokesman told reporters in Brussels: “The EU commission already announced on 31 January that it could help member states with organisation of such joint procurement schemes and this idea of joint procurement and reporting on the state of the medical supplies of the member states was a recurring topic of the agenda of the health and security committee meetings. “The UK was, as all other members of the health security committee meetings, aware of the work that was ongoing and had ample opportunity to express its wish to participate in a joint procurement if it wanted to do so. As to why it did not participate, this is obviously something on which we cannot comment.”"
2020-04-22T18:34:43Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus live: Some 'disruptive' lockdown measures set to remain in force for rest of year, says Whitty","Social distancing is likely to be needed until a vaccine is available for Covid-19, according to the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty. He told the daily news briefing he was hopeful for a vaccine within a year but there is a long way to go between having a vaccine and widespread immunity. It would therefore be â€œwholly unrealisticâ€� to think that restrictions would be relaxed any time soon and some â€œvery socially disruptiveâ€� measures would almost certainly have to remain in force for the rest of the year, he said. Whitty added that coronavirus was not going to be eradicated, so we must accept we will be working with it globally for the foreseeable future. We are at the peak of the outbreak, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told the Commons. But this was put into further perspective by Chris Whitty at the press briefing, who highlighted that the peak was an â€œartificial peakâ€� as it was the result of the lockdown. The first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, also reiterated that the biggest risk was a second spike. This all reinforces that an â€œexit strategyâ€� from physical distancing measures is proving more and more difficult to devise. A contact-tracing system will be in place â€œin a matter of weeksâ€�, Hancock also said. He said the effectiveness of â€œtest, track and traceâ€� every new case as a method rested on the incidence of transmission in the community. The UKâ€™s hospital death toll surpassed 18,000, as a further 759 deaths took the total to 18,100. The ONS said there had also been 1,043 coronavirus-related deaths in care homes in England and Wales by 10 April. In a joint statement with the CQC, the government conceded that the true number â€œcould be doubleâ€�. Chris Whitty also said he thought the ONS figures were â€œan underestimateâ€�. And analysis from the Financial Times suggested the real UK death toll could be as high as 41,000. The EU denied the UK governmentâ€™s claim that a mix-up was to blame for its non-involvement in its coronavirus procurement scheme. The European commission said the UK was well aware of the initiative when it decided not to participate, contradicting the governmentâ€™s claim that it didnâ€™t get involved because of a â€œmisunderstandingâ€� about eligibility. Facing questions from the Commons foreign affairs committee, Sir Simon McDonald, the head of the Foreign Office, said it was a â€œpolitical decisionâ€�, though he later issued a retraction and said non-involvement had been due to a â€œcommunication problemâ€�. The Welsh government is to fund free â€œschool mealsâ€� for disadvantaged children during the summer holidays. It is the first UK nation to make such a pledge. And the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, urged the government to ban evictions over rent arrears built up as a result of the coronavirus crisis. He also called for an increase in housing benefits and that the government should cover, for the duration of the crisis, any shortfall in payments by private renters. Thank you so much to everyone who got in touch throughout the day with news tips, suggestions, comments and advice. Thatâ€™s it from us on the UK side, weâ€™ll be back tomorrow to bring you all the latest updates on the pandemic. But in the meantime you can continue to follow the Guardianâ€™s coverage of the worldwide picture over on the global live blog."
2020-04-22T18:21:38Z,politics,Politics,Hancock's department 'warned No 10' not to publicise PPE shipment,"Downing Street ignored a firm warning from Matt Hancock’s Department of Health that ministers should not publicise the expected shipment of protective kit for NHS staff from Turkey in case it backfired, a senior departmental source has told the Guardian. In a sign of deepening tensions between the Department of Health and Downing Street, the source said that Hancock’s Cabinet colleague Robert Jenrick was “strongly advised” not to mention the consignment at the government’s coronavirus media briefing last Saturday. Instead, the housing, communities and local government secretary – with No 10’s approval – went ahead and promised that it would arrive the next day and contain 83 tonnes of personal protective equipment (PPE), including 400,000 of the full-length surgical gowns that are in critically short supply in the NHS. Its non-arrival on Sunday led hospital bosses to go public for the first time with their “intense frustration and exasperation” with ministers over botched deliveries of PPE. The disclosures – strongly denied by a source close to Hancock who called them “categorically not true and a fabrication” - come amid what appear to be growing difficulties at the heart of government over who is to blame for the difficulties Boris Johnson’s administration is facing over its handling of the Coronavirus crisis, especially the lack of both testing and PPE for NHS staff. Hancock was subject to a public attack in a front-page story in Tuesday’s Daily Telegraph, quoting government insiders, over his struggle to deliver the 100,000 tests for Coronavirus a day by the end of the month that he promised in early April. An unnamed person referred to as an insider who is close to Downing Street aides was quoted as calling the target “arbitrary”, and adding: “There is a faint irrationality behind it, just because there was a clamour for mass testing. Hancock’s 100,000 target was a response to a criticism in the media and he decided to crank out tests regardless. “He’s not had a good crisis. The prime minister will say he has confidence in him but it doesn’t feel like that. He set out to buy time by setting this target and it threatens to come back to bite him. The 100,000 figure was Hancock’s idea, but he made that figure up.” On Wednesday, the DHSC source said that Downing Street had been urged not to refer to the cargo before Saturday’s briefing. “We strongly advised Robert Jenrick against doing this [mentioning the Turkey shipment at the government press conference last Saturday] but he and No 10 overruled us,” the source said. “The advice we gave as a department was that we shouldn’t mention individual orders of PPE. But for whatever reason it wasn’t followed.” But another cabinet source said it was not right to say “it was just Matt that was warning about this”. “Lots of people were clear that we shouldn’t be talking about any shipments before they’ve arrived. Everyone in government is normally wary of this and I don’t know why it didn’t happen this time,” he said. The government has faced severe criticism this week over its handling of deliveries of foreign-sourced PPE to the UK. The promised arrival of 400,000 gowns urgently needed by frontline staff turning into a saga which dragged on into Wednesday, when one of three RAF planes that had been scheduled to bring the shipment back finally touched down in the UK. The plane had been dispatched from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, where two other aircraft have been on standby to pick up further supplies from Turkey since late on 20 April. The Department of Health and Social Care was blamed for failing to secure the necessary export approvals from Turkey after placing the order, but health sources said on 22 April that there were other reasons for the delay. The planes remain on standby at RAF Brize Norton and may fly to Istanbul imminently if there is enough equipment waiting to make the journey worthwhile. “We’ve been told there is another delivery at the airport now, but we are not yet sure if there’s enough to justify a flight,” a defence source said. There have been repeated ministerial assurances that the cargo would imminently arrive in the UK since Saturday when Jenrick first referred to it. His initial announcement was made even though necessary clearances had not been sought.
On Sunday, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said he hoped the shipment would arrive the next day. That promise was tentatively repeated by Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, on Monday morning after NHS leaders intervened. “I don’t want to start making more and more promises, but I understand that flight will take off this afternoon and those [gowns] will be delivered,” Dowden said. On Tuesday, the government finally adopted a more cautious tone. Simon Clarke, the local government minister, said the consignment would be in the UK “in the next few days”. The Whitehall source said: “We have been telling people off across government against doing this [talking about expected deliveries before they arrive]. We just need to stop talking about them until they arrive in the country. It’s just not helpful for the government for us to be talking about it. “The advice that we gave as a department was that we shouldn’t mention individual orders of PPE [because] supply chains are extremely unreliable. When orders fall through or are delayed, for whatever reason, it’s not good for anyone. Nobody in the NHS appreciates being told that we have got X tonnes of PPE turning up but it then not arriving.” The source added that Hancock has made clear to No 10 and other government departments that: “We shouldn’t be making promises that can’t be delivered on an exact date when we don’t know what will arrive or when. We’re just trying to exercise caution in the way we talk about supplies.” In the wake of last Sunday’s non-arrival from Turkey, NHS Providers and the NHS Confederation, which both represent hospital trusts in England, made clear that they wanted ministers to stop talking about PPE orders until they actually arrived and had been checked to ensure that they contain what had been ordered."
2020-04-22T17:25:33Z,politics,Politics,Welsh minister's mic mistake broadcasts sweary rant to assembly,"Wales’s health minister, Vaughan Gething, has learned the hard way about one of the risks of videoconferencing after he accidentally broadcast a sweary rant about one of his colleagues during a virtual session of Welsh assembly. Having apparently left his microphone live after addressing the assembly, the minister could be heard loudly decrying his fellow Labour assembly member Jenny Rathbone. “What the fuck is the matter with her?” he said, before complaining about Rathbone’s questions in an earlier part of the session, which was held via Zoom. Elin Jones, the assembly’s llywydd – equivalent to speaker – attempted to rescue the situation as Gething continued his rant. “I think Vaughan Gething needs to turn his microphone off,” she said, to no avail. “Vaughan Gething needs to turn his microphone off,” she repeated more forcefully, before the virtual hearing was cut off. Assembly members on the call could be seen reacting with shock and laughter. Afterwards, the opposition party Plaid Cymru called for Gething to resign.
Hours earlier, the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, had singled out Gething for criticism over the Welsh government’s handling of the pandemic. At Westminster, parliament hosted its first hybrid session on Wednesday, with prime minister’s questions taking place with a handful of MPs in the Commons and many more dialling in from their homes. During a hearing of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, a Labour MP’s attempt to berate the government for failing to roll out superfast broadband was cut short when her own broadband failed. Julie Elliott was pressing the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, on whether the government was doing enough to support households that could not access online resources for education, work or healthcare advice when her questioning was cut short. “You mentioned superfast broadbaaaaaannddd,” Elliott said, as the connection faltered. “Bane of my life at the minute.”
“I am personally struggling, as are people in Sunderland, and I’m sure across the country,” she continued before the connection froze entirely, leaving a bemused Julian Knight, the committee’s chair, muttering about the irony. A second attempt to ask the same question failed, and Dowden agreed to address the main problems of broadband provision. “I would resist saying you had timed it to demonstrate the challenges with your broadband,” he said."
2020-04-22T16:10:24Z,politics,Politics,Raab is tried and found wanting by a masterful Starmer | John Crace,"Finally. Finally we have a fully functioning opposition: one united behind a leader in whom they – almost – all believe. Keir Starmer might not have imagined a near-empty and silent chamber for his first outing at prime minister’s questions, but in a way it played to his strengths. For 45 minutes the usual Commons bear pit was transformed into a quiet courtroom drama, with a top QC up against the government’s junior barrister. A no contest, master versus pupil. Starmer is never going to set the world alight with grand gestures or the passion of his oratory. But what he does bring to the job is intelligence and a forensic attention to detail. He doesn’t just read his six prepared questions, he listens to the answers and adapts his follow-ups accordingly. Neither does he raise his voice or get rattled: rather he adapts his tone to the occasion. And he was near enough note perfect. After a brief reassurance that he would be seeking to support the government wherever possible during the coronavirus emergency, Starmer got to the heart of most of the country’s concerns. The health secretary had promised 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month and as of yesterday had managed just 18,000. How on earth did the government imagine it was going to reach its own target? Filling in for the absent Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab made the mistake of imagining he could go toe-to-toe with Starmer. Unfortunately the beta blockers he had taken to make him appear even-tempered had rather dulled his mind. We have the capacity to do 40,000 tests, Dom replied, and in any case the UK was going to ramp up its testing regime exponentially in the next eight days. If true, that would be remarkable, as Raab would have committed the government to a target of more like 400,000 tests a day. “I didn’t need correcting,” Starmer observed, nearly managing to keep the irritation out of his voice. Matt Hancock had promised 100,000 tests, not the capacity to do 100,000 tests. So the government was well behind its own targets. There was no point in setting up testing centres in places where NHS and care workers who suspected they were ill could not get to without travelling on public transport, risking infecting other people. Starmer then asked if Raab could give the exact number of NHS staff and care workers who had died in the pandemic so far. He couldn’t. But then neither could Helen Whately, the social care minister who is actually paid to know these things, in yet another disastrous media round earlier in the morning. Quite why No 10 insists on repeatedly sending out ministers whose only discernible ability is to know nothing about anything is one of the least investigated side-effects of the pandemic. “I’m putting you on notice that I’ll be asking the same question next week,” said Starmer. “Hopefully you will be able to answer it by then.” I wouldn’t count on it. Instead, Raab wittered on about how brilliantly the government had been doing, given the circumstances. You’d hate to think what the death rates would have been if the government hadn’t been quite so brilliant, given we are on target to overtake the Italians and the Spanish. Starmer merely ended with a warning. The UK had been slow to react in almost every respect. He made it sound like the opening address for the prosecution in the judge-led public inquiry that will inevitably follow when the pandemic is over. Raab had good reason to look worried. Most of the rest of PMQs took place with MPs dialling in remotely. And given that it was only the first day, the technology worked more or less OK, with only David Mundell failing to connect. As for the others, the chamber was treated to eight large TV screens of Ian Blackford, Peter Bone and Barry Gardiner. Which felt like seven too many. One of most MPs is usually more than enough. Matt Hancock appeared rather more at ease with himself during the statement that followed than he had at the No 10 press briefing the day before. Maybe he’s had time to reflect on the fact Dominic Cummings has lined him up as the government’s fall guy and has concluded he’s better off out of such a poisonous atmosphere. Que sera, sera. Even so, his statement wasn’t without its oddities. Most notably when he said he was going to repeat his five pillars. Only to unexpectedly add a sixth. It wasn’t clear if this sixth was to replace one of the others that had since crumbled, or whether it was genuinely a new addition. On the whole, ministers like to keep things in fives as they think that makes them look in control. Six of anything is a symptom of woolly thinking. Though maybe he was just building up to seven pillars of wisdom in time for Ramadan. The official advice is for those over 70 to continue to self-isolate at home, but nothing was going to stop Jeremy Corbyn from appearing in person. Even though he didn’t have anything to add that couldn’t have been said remotely. Still, good to know that Rebel, Rebel can still stick it to the Man. What we didn’t find out though, was why the permanent secretary to the Foreign Office had suddenly remembered that the evidence he had given to the select committee the previous day about the UK’s decision not to join an EU procurement scheme had actually been completely wrong. You could almost feel Classic Dom’s gun in Sir Simon McDonald’s back as he wrote that retraction. Still, come the inevitable reckoning, the one thing we can guarantee is there won’t be a show trial. With Starmer as leader of the opposition, any trial will be the genuine article."
2020-04-22T14:00:19Z,politics,Politics,"Wealth tax rise could raise Â£174bn to tackle Covid-19, expert says","The government has the potential to raise up to £174bn a year to help cope with the Covid-19 crisis if it taxed wealth at the same rate as income, a UK tax expert has said. Richard Murphy, a professor in political economy at City University in London, said income was being taxed at almost 10 times the rate of wealth – and that the disparity should be central to any debate about who should pay for the pandemic. In an analysis of the period from 2011 to 2018, Murphy said income had been taxed on average at 29.4% while wealth – generated mostly from rising house prices and the increased value of personal pensions – had been taxed at 3.4%. He added that this made Britain’s overall tax system highly regressive because the gains from rising wealth tended to be concentrated among the better off while council tax, VAT, the BBC licence fee and duties on alcohol and tobacco took up a bigger slice of the incomes of the poorest households.
The effective tax rate for the wealthiest 10% of the population – once income and wealth were combined – was 18%, less than half the 42% effective tax rate for the bottom 10%. “What the data shows is that if we treat all sources of financial gain to a household, whether from income or from increases in the value of assets, as being of equal value then we have a very regressive tax system in the UK. That means that those on the lowest levels of income pay by far the highest tax rates, whilst those with the highest income pay at the lowest rates.” The amount of revenue the government would be able to raise from taxing wealth more heavily would depend on how much behaviour changed as a result of the higher levies. Murphy said his study was meant to highlight the flaws in the UK tax system rather than whether it was desirable or even technically feasible to raise £174bn in full. “This has massive implications for the forthcoming debate on who, if anyone, should pay for the coronavirus crisis. What is clear is that the only fair answer will be that those on the highest incomes, and those with wealth, are the only people who could afford to pick up that bill. If anything, everyone else needs a tax cut just to help them survive. Any politician with any concern for tax justice will have to understand this.” Murphy said he was not campaigning for a wealth tax as such, but suggested there were a number of ways the government could pick “low-hanging fruit”, including: Introducing a capital gains tax charge on former main residences passed on after death, with the exception of cohabiting spouses and civil partners and recognised long-term related carers. Equalising the tax rates on income and capital gains. Significantly reducing the annual capital gains tax allowance. Abolishing higher-rate tax reliefs for pension contributions. The coronavirus crisis is putting heavy pressure on government finances, with the Office for Budget Responsibility pencilling in a budget deficit of £280bn in the 2020-21 financial year.
Murphy said even if it were decided that the government and borrowing could pay for the whole coronavirus crisis the issue of the different taxation of income and wealth would not go away. “What this data shows is that inequality in the UK is being massively fuelled by our tax system, at cost to us all. That has to be wrong. Radical reform of our taxes has to be on the agenda, now.”"
2020-04-22T12:55:49Z,politics,Politics,Truss dismisses concerns over lack of women leading No 10 briefings,"The women and equalities minister has dismissed concerns over the number of female ministers leading the daily Downing Street coronavirus press conference as “tokenism”. Liz Truss said “excessive focus on what gender” the politician helming the televised briefing was “does a disservice to women”. The afternoon press conference has only once been taken by a woman – the home secretary, Priti Patel – since it began five weeks ago. As well the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the first secretary, Dominic Raab, and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, more junior cabinet members such as the business secretary, Alok Sharma, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, and the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, have also fronted the briefing. “The home secretary has already made an appearance at the daily press conference and there has also been appearances from senior medical professionals such as Dr Jenny Harries,” said Truss, defending the gender imbalance. “Women are playing a key role in the response – [work and pensions secretary] Thérèse Coffey ... she’s done a number of media appearances and I think she’s doing an absolutely brilliant job in dealing with the number of universal credit claims.” Giving evidence to the virtual women and equalities committee on Wednesday, Truss was asked by the chairwoman, Caroline Nokes, if she would be appearing at any of the media briefings. “I don’t like tokenism,” said Truss. “I don’t like the idea that someone should just appear at a press conference or in a media interview because they are a woman. They should be doing that, and the work internally, because of the merits of what they are capable of.” Nokes responded: “So they shouldn’t be there just because they are a women, but you have a remit for elderly people, for the disabled, for those from a BAME background, for the LGBTQ community – a massive group of people who will be impacted by Covid-19 – and you think it would be tokenism to appear at one of those press conferences.” “I’m not saying that at all,” said Truss. “What I’m saying is the excessive focus on what gender somebody is rather than what they do does a disservice to women … I believe that women are equally as capable as men, that we need more women in politics … but I think we should be focusing on the right people to present at the press conference. “The major issue at the moment is health so I think it’s right that the health secretary is doing a lot of the press conferences. I think excessive focus on who is appearing at a press conference is the wrong focus.” Asked about the evidence that more men were dying from coronavirus than women, and that BAME people were also disproportionately affected, Truss said: “Across the board we are trying to find out more about Covid-19, but it’s a relatively new disease and a lot more needs to be done … We’re looking at getting data in a useable format at the moment.”"
2020-04-22T12:24:48Z,politics,Politics,PMQs verdict: a distinct improvement on what came before,"Snap verdict This was Sir Keir Starmer’s first outing as Labour leader at PMQs, facing Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, who was standing in for Boris Johnson. Just as importantly this marked the debut for a whole new way of running this question session - a “hybrid” system, with most MPs participating by Zoom. Both probably amount to a distinct improvement on what came before. First, the process. On a technical level it mostly worked well. One MP did not manage to dial in in time, and another got cut off early. But overall it worked without a hitch. More importantly, PMQs without 400-odd MPs in the chamber makes everything quieter, calmer, more intelligible and more grown-up. For once the proceedings sounded like the question time sessions that take place in the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly. Without the jeering and the aggro, it lacked gladiatorial edge, and frankly it was probably a bit more boring than the old PMQs. But boring is a much under-rated virtue in governance. It will be be very interesting to see whether the Commons ever reverts to how it operated before when (or more probably if) this is all over. Under the old PMQs MPs worked on the assumption that there was always a “winner” at PMQs. (Journalists like me wrote it up like in those terms too, because that was how the participants viewed the proceedings.) Under Zoom PMQs it is much harder to imagine anyone “winning” old-style, but if Labour had to choose someone well suited to parliament in serious/boring mode, it is hard to imagine anyone better than Starmer, and he will chalk today’s outing up, not as a triumph, but certainly as a success. His questions were clear, forensic and focused, he avoided bland or trite sloganising and he adopted a measured tone consistent with responsible, constructive opposition. Quite what the public will make of this when the alternative is Johnson remains to be seen, but high-grade seriousness is what Starmer offered in the Labour leadership contest and it is what he delivered today. Key quotes: Keir Starmer: I’m disappointed we don’t have a number for social care workers [who have died] and I put the first secretary on notice that I’ll ask the same question again next week and hopefully we can have a better answer. Dominic Raab: People said that we couldn’t build a hospital in this country at that kind of speed, and we’ve built several, with more to come."
2020-04-22T12:11:14Z,politics,Politics,Starmer grills Raab over care home deaths in first virtual PMQs,"Dominic Raab has admitted the government does not know how many care home staff have died from Covid-19 in the first virtual prime minister’s questions. The first secretary of state, who is deputising for Boris Johnson while the prime minister recovers from the virus, was questioned by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who accused the government of being far slower than other EU countries on testing and said its personal protective equipment strategy was not working. Asked how many NHS and care staff had died from the virus, Raab said: “On the latest figures, my understanding is 69 people have died within the NHS of coronavirus and I don’t have the precise figure for care homes – they are more difficult to establish in relation to care home workers as opposed to care home residents.
“Every one of those is a tragedy and that can only double down our efforts to tackle this virus.” Starmer, who was taking part in his first PMQs as Labour leader, said he was disappointed that there was no figure and said was putting Raab “on notice” that he would ask the same question next week. He told the Commons that care home staff were scared and having to make their own masks. The two men were in the chamber in person while many MPs asked Raab questions via video link. Earlier in the day the care minister Helen Whateley said 15 care workers and 61 NHS workers had died from coronavirus, prompting questions over the accuracy of figures being used by ministers. The true number of deaths is estimated to be far higher than official figures. On testing Starmer said that with just eight days to go until the promised 100,000 tests a day was due to be achieved, only 18,000 were completed in the last 24 hours.
Raab said: “I have to correct him. Our capacity is now 40,000 per day so I think that is an incredibly important milestone. And of course he’s right to say that in the final week that will require a big increase. “I can reassure him that we are working with a range of commercial partners to boost the testing to get to that 100,000 a day.” He said two “super-labs” in Milton Keynes and Alderley Park in Cheshire were fully functional and another in Glasgow would open later this week. However, Starmer hit back, saying: “I didn’t need correcting because I gave the figure for the actual tests a day. The first secretary says there’s capacity for 40,000 a day. “That means that the day before yesterday 40,000 tests could have been carried out but only 18,000 tests were actually carried out. “Why isn’t the government using all the tests available, every day?” Raab said the government was making good progress and wanted to encourage people to come forward to take tests, and that it understood the transport challenges people had experienced to get to sites."

2020-04-22T11:50:34Z,politics,Politics,EU turns up pressure on Matt Hancock over Covid-19 PPE scheme,"The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is facing fresh pressure over the protection offered to NHS staff after the European commission said the UK had been given “ample opportunity” to join an EU scheme bulk-buying masks, gowns, gloves and goggles. After a day of confusion in Westminster over the UK’s lack of involvement in the EU’s joint procurement of equipment, a spokesman for the commission appeared to bolster the claim that ministers had taken a “political decision” to opt out. The commission spokesman said UK representatives had been briefed on the EU plans throughout February and March when they could have signed up for the huge purchases of ventilators, laboratory supplies and personal protective equipment.
UK officials and ministers have repeatedly said the government only failed to take part in the schemes because “owing to an initial communication problem, the UK did not receive an invitation in time”. The commission spokesman told reporters in Brussels: “The EU commission already announced on 31 January that it could help member states with organisation of such joint procurement schemes and this idea of joint procurement and reporting on the state of the medical supplies of the member states was a recurring topic of the agenda of the health and security committee meetings. “The UK was, as all other members of the health security committee meetings, aware of the work that was ongoing and had ample opportunity to express its wish to participate in a joint procurement if it wanted to do so. As to why it did not participate, this is obviously something on which we cannot comment.” On Wednesday, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, speaking in the Commons, announced that 69 people working within the NHS had died from the coronavirus. There are growing fears about the shortages of personal protective equipment within the healthcare system. Raab confirmed, in response to questions from the new Labour leader, Keir Starmer, that the government needed to “strive even harder in this incredibly difficult and competitive international environment” to source protective equipment. As the Guardian has previously revealed, UK health officials attended meetings on 31 January, 4 February, 2 March and 13 March, where joint procurement rounds for protective gear, ventilators and medical supplies were discussed. On Tuesday, the health secretary was forced to deny claims, since retracted, by the UK’s most senior diplomat, Sir Simon McDonald, that ministers had made a “political decision” in not getting involved. Speaking at Downing Street’s daily press briefing on Tuesday evening, Hancock said: “I have spoken to the foreign secretary. As far as I’m aware there was no political decision not to participate. “We did receive an invitation in the Department of Health and it was put up to me to be asked and we joined so we are now members of that scheme.”
A spokesman for the European commission rebutted any suggestion that the UK was currently involved in any of the EU’s efforts to buy masks, gowns, ventilators or laboratory supplies. “They are most welcome to participate in future rounds,” the spokesman said.
The EU launched four rounds of procurement of personal protective equipment, ventilators and laboratory supplies in late February and March. The Guardian revealed last week that UK officials failed to take up an invitation to join the steering committee of participating countries that issues orders for medical equipment until 19 March – after the bulk purchases had been made. The UK’s involvement in the EU’s scheme would not have precluded independent efforts to source equipment. Deliveries of protective equipment to European health workers are expected within days."
2020-04-21T21:18:14Z,politics,Politics,Downing Street defends Hancock as blame game starts over  PPE shortages,"Downing Street has weighed in behind the health secretary, Matt Hancock, following a report that he is being lined up to take the rap for failures over protective equipment testing. Boris Johnson’s official spokesman said the prime minister has full confidence in Hancock and stands behind his pledge to get the UK to 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April, despite only 19,000 being carried out on Monday. However, a blame game has started in Whitehall about some of the problems that have dogged the government’s reaction to the Covid-19 crisis, with Hancock’s handling of the logistics around testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) under the spotlight. At the same time, some government sources have been pointing the finger at Public Health England for its sluggishness in increasing testing, and the NHS for failing to refer enough staff, which means completed tests are well below capacity of more than 39,000. With recriminations flying, Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader, became the first politician to call for a judge-led public inquiry into the government’s actions after the pandemic is over, saying it “must have the strongest possible powers given the shocking failures on protective equipment for staff and the slow response of the government – to get to the truth and to give Boris Johnson the opportunity to answer the increasingly serious questions.” Tensions spilled into the open on Monday when an anonymous insider close to Downing Street told the Telegraph that Hancock’s 100,000 testing target was “made up”, and was an arbitrary figure that would “come back to bite him”. However, Johnson’s spokesman said: “An insider close to Downing Street is a new one on me. Whoever they are, and it could be anyone given that description, they are wrong.” He added: “We’ve said throughout that is a government target. We are working hard to hit it.” Johnson has previously set a target of 250,000 tests a day, without putting a date on it. A cabinet source said Hancock may have irritated some in No 10 and there had been tensions between him and Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, in the “quad” of decision-making. But they questioned whether Downing Street would seek to make Hancock a scapegoat at such a crucial time, when he has such an important role in coordinating the government’s health response to the pandemic. Hancock also received backing from an unlikely source – one of his Labour predecessors, Andy Burnham, who is mayor of Greater Manchester.
“I don’t agree with everything Matt Hancock has done but he has called some things right and I am certain he’s working flat out right now in the PM’s absence. With that in mind, this is an appalling move by Downing Street. It helps no one. Whoever’s responsible should be ashamed,” he said. Hancock, speaking at No 10’s daily press briefing, defended the UK’s response – and by extension his handling of the health department – saying the international comparisons about the spread of infections should take into account the size of the country. “At the start of this crisis, we said there were two absolutely critical tasks that formed part of the battle plan. One is that we got the exponential spread of this under control and brought the curve down. As you can see, that curve is now flat and that means we have achieved that objective,” he said. “The second thing we said is that we must do everything we can to make sure the NHS is not overwhelmed. We have achieved that because every single person who has needed treatment has been able to get that treatment … On those two core measures, the plan is working. “Does it mean every problem has been addressed? No of course not. I’ve gone through some of the details on PPE, where there are clearly challenges … But on the absolutely central core objectives, thanks to the work of the NHS, armed forces and many others, and people who have stayed at home, we have managed to bend down the curve and ensured NHS capacity is there.” He said he and his officials were looking every day at “how do you learn from where things are going well and where things aren’t going so well ... we are constantly looking around the world at these comparisons”."

2020-04-21T19:09:59Z,politics,Politics,"No votes, no tough questions: MPs struggle with life after lockdown","Mountain, meet molehill. Over the past month, countless businesses have had to adapt to survive. Selling more online, having meetings over Zoom, that kind of thing. Yet for its first day back in session, the Commons was struggling big time to adjust. It took more than an hour for a handful of MPs to agree some fairly basic procedures. Everything was most irregular. The like of which had not been seen since 1349. You could tell we were in trouble right from the off as it was Jacob Rees-Mogg who was easily the most enthusiastic moderniser in the Commons. What he was proposing all seemed entirely sensible. Not to mention straightforward. Fifty MPs in the house at any one time, with another 120 logging in online. No tricky votes for at least a week as no one had yet worked out how to make the system work. FFS. Even a Channel 5 gameshow has a secure audience voting system. And if we were still members of the EU, we could have got some guidance from them as the Brussels parliament has been using an online voting system for years. But that ship has long since sailed. The shadow leader of the Commons, Valerie Vaz, was about the only person willing to embrace the new normal. Everyone else was more concerned about having ancient privileges taken away from them in perpetuity. The DUP’s Ian Paisley Jr and Jim Shannon were most exercised that the Commons might use its new regime to sneak through a vote allowing abortion in Northern Ireland. The situation cried out for someone to stand up and shout: “We’re in the middle of a global pandemic that’s killing thousands of people every day. So stop arsing about and being so bloody precious. No one’s trying to rewrite the rulebook for good. We’re just trying to muddle through and hold the government to account as best they can.” After more than an hour of pointless nitpicking, the few dozen MPs in the chamber grudgingly nodded the new measures through. And then promptly went home. There was no time to ask the government any tricky questions like the future. Best to break off for tea before watching the daily Downing Street press briefing instead. Today’s government frontman was Matt Hancock, who throughout looked to be on the verge of tears, his voice catching with emotion. Normally the health secretary is a walking, talking Tigger, bouncing with man-child optimism in the face of any impending catastrophe. But now he was utterly subdued. Broken, even. And well he might be. The vague sense of a collegiate cabinet truce that had appeared in place when Boris Johnson first fell ill is well and truly over. Since Dominic Cummings came back to work, the knives are out to find a scapegoat for when the coronavirus reckoning inevitably comes. And the blades are all pointing in Matt’s back. Classic Dom. Screw things up and get someone else to take the blame. Part of Hancock’s tragedy is that he is the architect of his own downfall. While other ministers seek to shift the blame and keep things vague, there is an intrinsic goodness and honesty to Matt. He does really care. Out of a dried-out riverbed of talent at the head of government, he is the closest we have got to a politician of integrity. It’s just that he’s not always as competent as he might be. Desperate to provide some hope and answers in a political vacuum of self-distancing from accountability. So he writes cheques he knows can’t be cashed. He makes promises that can’t be kept. There isn’t a prayer that the arbitrary target of 100,000 tests per day he ad libbed a few weeks ago will be met, so this is the cross on which the Grand Inquisitor, Classic Dom, will crucify him. With all this going on, the press briefing was understandably a car crash. With scattered parts all over the place. He promised that anyone who needed a hospital bed would get one. He just couldn’t guarantee that any of the doctors or nurses would have the necessary personal protective equipment to treat them. The transport plane that’s gone missing in Istanbul is now being written in as a character in the latest Dan Brown romp. Matt did also say that the first vaccine would be trialled on a person this coming Thursday. “But,” said the Anti-Tigger. But the science was very uncertain and so people shouldn’t get their hopes up too much. This from a minister who has consistently trotted out the party line that the science was always 100% accurate and that every decision had been taken in line with scientific advice. Hancock was in freefall, visibly being pulled in two different directions. His centre can no longer hold. Most questions focused on the evidence that Simon McDonald, the permanent secretary to the Foreign Office, had given to a select committee that afternoon. Namely that Michael Gove’s assertion that the UK’s failure to join the EU procurement programme had been an email administrative error was total bollocks. It had been a political decision all along. Who would have guessed the Govester had been caught out lying again? Hancock, though, was adamant. As health secretary he had definitely signed up to the EU programme. Leaving open the possibility that he had been overruled by Boris, Gove or Dominic Raab. Hell, if he was going down he might as well take some of the real guilty parties down with him. For the first time during the briefing, a ghost of a smile crossed his lips."
2020-04-21T18:10:56Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson speaks to Donald Trump from Chequers,"Boris Johnson has spoken to Donald Trump and will have a telephone audience with the Queen this week, even though No 10 continues to insist he is not doing any government work while he recovers from coronavirus at Chequers.
The prime minister spoke to the US president on Tuesday afternoon to “thank Trump for his good wishes while he was unwell”, but also took the opportunity to talk about the G7’s efforts to combat the virus and reaffirm his desire for a UK-US trade agreement. A Downing Street spokesman said: “The leaders agreed on the importance of a coordinated international response to coronavirus, including through the G7 – which the US currently chairs. They also discussed continued UK-US cooperation in the fight against the pandemic. The leaders committed to continue working together to strengthen our bilateral relationship, including by signing a free trade agreement as soon as possible.” The White House said the prime minister “shared that he is feeling better and on the road to recovery”. Johnson will also have a telephone audience with the Queen later this week, probably on Wednesday or Thursday, after missing several weeks because of his illness. The prime minister has also been making calls to government ministers as he seeks updates on the response to the virus, amid continuing criticism of the effort to get personal protective equipment to the NHS and care homes as well as the failure to ramp up testing to promised levels. His spokesman told a Westminster briefing: “The prime minister is continuing his recovery at Chequers and isn’t formally doing government work. “He has been receiving updates from No 10 on the coronavirus response and has spoken with the first secretary of state and senior members of his team. “Yesterday he sent a message of condolence to Justin Trudeau after the very sad loss of life in the shooting in Canada. “Later today, at around about 2pm, he will be speaking with President Trump.” Johnson went to Chequers to recuperate after spending a week in hospital, including three days in intensive care, when his breathing deteriorated. He has been off work for just over two weeks, with Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, deputising for him in the meantime.
During his absence, there have been complaints of a power vacuum and criticism over key issues such as how the UK will eventually try to ease the lockdown."
2020-04-21T17:24:43Z,politics,Politics,Virtual House of Lords sittings will not be broadcast live,"Virtual hearings of the House of Lords will not be televised after the upper house of parliament decided to use a Microsoft video-conferencing programme rather than Zoom. Some peers said the decision to run parliament in this manner was “unacceptable”, after it emerged that sessions will effectively be held in private for an initial two-week period.
While the House of Commons was using Zoom and broadcasting proceedings live, the Lords has been equipped with Microsoft Teams, with peers blaming technical limitations for the decision. The Lords’ Conservative chief whip, Lord Hyde, said the upper house would only use Zoom when it is was secure, raising questions over why the Commons was able to roll out use of the programme to 650 MPs. He said that the public would be able to follow proceedings in the Lords by reading Hansard, the official written record of what is said in the chamber, which is available online within a few hours of a debate finishing. Television broadcasters are also understood to have raised concerns about the lack of footage. Labour’s Lord Adonis led the criticism in the chamber as a handful of peers observing social-distancing rules returned in person after the Easter recess. He said: “It will not be possible for the public to observe what’s going on, which is a breach of all precedent in terms of parliamentary proceedings and is a matter of very great concern.”
He added: “If we were using Zoom, as the House of Commons is, then it would be possible to broadcast proceedings. If that is the case, what is the mechanism by which broadcasting will be possible within a fortnight’s time, presuming that is the intention? For anything other than a very short period of time while technical difficulties are sorted out it is absolutely unacceptable that the proceedings of this house are not broadcast.” Lord Hyde agreed that it would have been “nice” if the Lords was able to broadcast its virtual proceedings but the Commons was the immediate focus of parliament’s digital capabilities. “There is only limited amount of resource that the parliamentary digital service has got and they are, I think it’s fair to say, concentrating on the House of Commons and they are able to broadcast. I think it’s reasonable that in the absence of as many resources that we want that we should focus on the elected house.” The Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, told the BBC that the new technology was a trial for both houses and it would be interesting to see “which system works best”. Lord Fowler added that they were going to look at moving to Zoom in the coming days. Peers have also come under fire for reports that members are keen to claim their £323 daily allowance while they are logging into virtual parliamentary sessions. The Lords’ speaker, Lord Fowler, told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the daily stipend was being considered and acknowledged the “pretty strong argument” for a reduced fee while they do not need to leave their homes. Virtual working arrangements for parliament also bring new challenges. Labour’s Valerie Vaz told the Commons that MPs would be expected to wear formal clothes while appearing on camera, with one key clarification: “The dress code will only apply to the top half.”"
2020-04-21T16:02:03Z,politics,Politics,Scientists join calls for UK public to wear homemade face masks outdoors,"The public should wear homemade masks when they venture outdoors to help reduce the spread of coronavirus, according to scientists who claim Britain’s masks policy does too little to prevent infections.
Prof Sian Griffiths, who led the Hong Kong government’s investigation into the 2003 Sars epidemic, said Britain should adopt the same approach as the US, where people are advised to make their own “cloth face coverings” and wear them in public spaces. Trish Greenhalgh, a professor of primary care health sciences at Oxford University who recently completed a review on face masks, also advocated the use of masks in public and suggested an old T-shirt combined with kitchen paper would suffice. The US policy is being directed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and is designed to reduce at least some transmission of the virus while preventing a run on medical-grade masks needed by frontline health workers. “The CDC advice in the US is pragmatic,” Griffiths said. “It recognises both the need to ensure the supply of masks for clinical situations where they are obviously needed at the same time as recognising that there could potentially be benefits in wearing ‘masks’ in public to prevent passing on the infection.”
The government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) met on Tuesday to review the evidence on wearing face masks. The Guardian understands that the group is split on the best policy to adopt because the evidence is so weak. Ministers are deeply reluctant to recommend the use of even homemade masks amid concerns that people will rush to buy medical masks and leave the NHS facing even greater supply shortages. Asked about potential changes to the advice on the face masks, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said at the daily No 10 press conference that ministers would be “guided by the science as always”. Speaking at the briefing, Professor Jonathan Van-Tham, England’s deputy chief medical officer, said advice from Sage would be passed on to ministers. But he stressed there was “an absolute enduring principle” not to jeopardise supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) to health and social care workers, adding: “that is a line that we are not going to cross under any circumstances.” Public Health England recommends face masks for the NHS and in social care settings but does not advise healthy people to wear them outside. World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines state that while masks can help prevent people from passing on coronavirus, they are inadequate protection on their own from contracting it. Greenhalgh, on the back of a review on face masks, said homemade versions could dramatically reduce the amount of droplets sprayed from people’s mouths, which can carry the virus if the person is infected. “We should be covering our faces with homespun materials like cotton. Medical-grade masks are scratchy and uncomfortable. Your old T-shirt is soft and nice, and with a couple of layers of kitchen paper inside a double layer, it will reduce the droplets coming out of your mouth and nose by about 95%,” she said. She added: “The public should not and must not divert medical-grade supplies.” There is growing unease over the government’s reluctance to recommend the use of face masks. Doctors across the UK have now backed the Masks4AllUK movement, which argues that people should wear homemade masks when they go out. At a press conference on Friday, the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said that while Sage would look at the evidence, it was “absolutely crucial” that masks were available in hospitals and other high-risk transmission areas. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents healthcare trusts across England, said the impact on the NHS must be fully assessed. “Fluid-repellent masks for health and care staff are key to safety and to avoid the spread of coronavirus,” he said. “Securing the supply of masks, when there is huge global demand, is crucial. This must be a key consideration for government. There needs to be clear evidence that wearing masks, along with other measures, will deliver significant enough benefits to take us out of lockdown to potentially jeopardise NHS mask supply.” Prof David Heymann, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who chairs an independent advisory group to the WHO emergencies programme that is managing the Covid-19 pandemic, said the purpose of wearing face masks was to prevent the wearer from spreading the virus if they were infected themselves. “Masks should not be worn by the general public to protect themselves as there is evidence that masks do not prevent infection by other respiratory infections such as flu,” he said. “The best way that the general public can support government policy is to understand how to protect themselves and protect others if they are sick or believe they may be infected. This is by physical distancing, social distancing and frequent handwashing.”"
2020-04-21T15:46:02Z,politics,Politics,Right to rent rule 'justified' finds UK appeal court,"The government has won an appeal over its controversial right to rent scheme, which was last year ruled by the high court to be racially discriminatory. The scheme, which is a key element of the Home Office’s “hostile environment” for illegal migration, requires private landlords to check the immigration status of tenants and prospective tenants. Those landlords that fail to complete checks can face fines and up to five years in prison. The high court found last year that requiring landlords to check the immigration status of prospective tenants was unlawful and racially discriminatory because it caused landlords to discriminate against British citizens from minority ethnic backgrounds and against foreign nationals who had a legal right to rent. The court ruled that the policy had a “disproportionately discriminatory effect”, as well as “little to no effect” on controlling immigration, and was incompatible with the right to freedom from discrimination, enshrined in European human rights legislation. But the Home Office appealed against that ruling, and the appeal court found that while some landlords did discriminate against would-be tenants who had no British passport, the scheme was nevertheless “justified” as a “proportionate means of achieving its legitimate objective”. The judgement acknowledged that some landlords discriminated against people without a British passport due to “administrative convenience and a fear of the consequences of letting to an irregular immigrant”, but added that most complied with the requirements without discriminating. Lawyers acting for the Home Office told the appeal court in January that the government could not be held responsible for landlords “choosing” to discriminate by preferring tenants with a UK passport. About 17% of the population in England and Wales do not hold a passport. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), which opposed the government’s appeal, argued that the state “plainly is responsible for the discriminatory effects of its actions, whether intended or not”. The JCWI said it was preparing to appeal against the ruling at the supreme court and renewed calls for the scheme to be repealed. Chai Patel, the JCWI’s legal policy director, said that the appeal court had upheld the high court’s finding that landlords were discriminating against migrants or people of ethnic minority backgrounds as they sought to adhere to the right to rent legislation. However, the ruling did not conclude that this meant the scheme was in violation of human rights law. “The Home Office has always maintained that this racial discrimination wasn’t caused by the scheme. Now we have two court rulings confirming that the government is causing racial discrimination in the housing market against ethnic minority British people, like the Windrush generation,” Patel said. “At a time when our lives depend on our ability to stay at home safely, ethnic minorities and foreign nationals are being forced by the government to face discrimination in finding a safe place for them and their families to live.” The junior immigration minister Chris Philp welcomed the decision. “As we have made clear throughout, the scheme ensures that only those with a legal right to be in the UK are able to access benefits and services, and [it] discourages people from entering the country unlawfully. This is also a question of fairness to UK citizens and the many people who come to the UK legally who all need to access housing.”"
2020-04-21T14:33:25Z,politics,Politics,Campaigners take legal action over £27bn UK road-building scheme,"Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to try to prevent billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money being spent on a huge road-building programme, which they say breaches the UK’s legal commitments to tackle the climate crisis and air pollution. Lawyers acting for the Transport Action Network (Tan) have begun legal proceedings against the Department for Transport calling for the road-building scheme, which was confirmed last month by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to be suspended. They argue that ministers did not take into account the government’s legally binding commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. They also say the government has not considered whether the £27bn programme is in line with its obligations under the Paris climate agreement. The move follows a successful challenge to the proposed third runway at Heathrow. In that case the court ruled that the planned airport expansion was illegal because ministers did not adequately take into account the government’s commitments to tackle the climate crisis. The road-building programme is thought to be the UK’s largest and would lead to thousands of miles of new roads being built across the country in the coming years – with at least 50 projects due to be under way in the next two years. The UK’s road network and its wider transport infrastructure are crucial in the country’s efforts to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. The transport sector is the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and the only one to have increased its emissions in recent years. Chris Todd, Tan’s director, said it was impossible to take the government seriously on the threat posed by climate change when it is “set to burn billions on the largest ever roads programme”. “This massive roads programme has become like a juggernaut that’s out of control, that no one can stop. We now have no choice but to go to court to prevent an unfolding disaster.” Tan wrote to the secretary of state following the court of appeal’s Heathrow decision in February requesting a pause in the road-building programme to allow time to reconsider its environmental effects. It said it did not receive a response to that letter. Lawyers have sent a pre-action protocol letter that is the official start of legal proceedings. Rowan Smith, from the solicitors Leigh Day, which is pursuing the case on behalf of Tan, said the group was raising “legitimate concerns” at a time when it was widely established that the climate emergency “demands a move away from a continued reliance on fossil fuels towards more sustainable transport”. The government’s climate change adviser has joined calls for ministers to reconsider its road-building plans. Chris Stark, the head of the Committee on Climate Change, said it would be better for the economy and the fight against climate breakdown for the billions of pounds allocated for road-building to be invested in broadband – especially in light of the coronavirus crisis, which has led to many more people working from home. “The government mustn’t be investing in anything likely to increase carbon emissions,” Stark told the BBC. “I expect that video-conferencing will become the new normal and we won’t return to travelling the way we did. I would spend the roads budget on fibre. You would get a huge return to the economy with people having better connections. You would save people’s time and increase their productivity.” His comments echo those of the head of the motoring organisation the AA, who said this month that government money would be better invested in broadband than roads. In response to the legal challenge, a spokesperson for the Department for Transport defended its plans. “The second road investment strategy is consistent with our ambitions to improve air quality and decarbonise transport,” they said. “We have received the letter and will respond formally in due course.’’"
2020-04-20T18:57:40Z,politics,Politics,Is it unusual for a PM to skip Cobra meetings?,"It was David Cameron who expanded the Cobra emergency planning system when he was prime minister, telling officials he wanted to be “one step ahead” of crisis events. His successor, Theresa May, was reluctant use it at first because she disliked a structure that had been used to assert authority over the Home Office she once ran. The charge against Boris Johnson is that he did not want to turn up at all, skipping five Cobra meetings that discussed coronavirus in January and February and only chairing his first on 3 March, several weeks after the scale of the crisis had become apparent. Situated in the basement of the Cabinet Office, not far from Churchill’s war rooms, the Cobra suite of meeting rooms is the closest thing to a White House situation room that Whitehall has. Holding a Cobra meeting in front of the bank of screens conveys urgent action like nothing else in British politics.
Civil servants caution that Cobra is not necessarily at the heart of how British government should be run. It was designed – after Britain watched West Germany’s hapless response to the 1972 Munich hostage crisis – to give a cross-government focus on an emergency incident, a terror attack or a mass-casualty disaster. Officials say it is not part of the normal Whitehall machine. Some of its meetings, which tend to be hardly reported, are attended only by civil servants. Others are chaired by departmental ministers – Amber Rudd, when home secretary, chaired a Cobra meeting during the Skripal crisis, for instance. The presence of the prime minister is by no means necessary, although in each case the decision to hold a lower-level meeting should have been signed off by No 10.
The system is designed to be resilient, so in theory it does not matter who chairs it: the brief is so detailed for whoever takes the meeting that they can lead the ministers and officials present “however stressed they are”. As the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said: “It is perfectly normal for the prime minister to delegate to the health secretary, or whoever the relevant secretary of state is, to chair Cobra. This is a normal, proper course of government.” But as Gordon Brown’s former press aide Damian McBride pointed out over the weekend, during a foot and mouth crisis in 2007, Brown “didn’t just attend every Cobra meeting, he chaired them all”. That may have said a lot about Brown’s approach to running government, to the point where he micromanaged detail, but it also showed a prime minister ready to engage with the issue at hand.
Chairing a Cobra meeting is a prime minister’s choice, former officials say, and it is one way of highlighting the need for an early cross-government focus on a crisis such as coronavirus. Instead the government has repeatedly looked like it is behind the curve, as shown by the desperate attempts to ramp up testing, the calls for ventilator manufacturers to come forward, and the struggles to ensure there is enough protective equipment for NHS staff."
2020-04-20T18:15:08Z,politics,Politics,Who are the doves and hawks of UK's Covid-19 lockdown policy?,"Doves Boris Johnson, prime minister Johnson is cautious about the idea the UK should be rushing to lift lockdown measures, as he fears a second wave of the pandemic could cripple the country. From the Chequers estate, where he is recovering from coronavirus, Johnson held discussions with the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, and his director of communications, Lee Cain, last Friday. During the meeting he let it be known he was deeply concerned about the cost of a second peak to both the economy and people’s health. Cummings is also understood to be on the side of caution while so little is known about the consequences of lifting the lockdown. Matt Hancock, health secretary Hancock has been an active proponent of continued lockdown to try to relieve pressure on the NHS and get the transmission rate as low as possible before easing restrictions. He has been vocal about the government not giving away its lockdown exit strategy as it might lead to people starting to disobey the rules. However, in virtual meetings involving some cabinet ministers he has been coming up against their concerns about the health and social impact of a sharp economic downturn and other consequences of lockdown such as escalating domestic abuse levels.
In the middle Dominic Raab, foreign secretary, deputising as prime minister Raab is known to be instinctively in favour of a swift end to the lockdown but is also keeping his position close to that of the prime minister. He was leading the government at the time the decision was taken to extend lockdown measures by three weeks to 7 May, and was clear about the risks to the economy and the health of the nation if it was lifted too quickly. When pressed for a timeline, Raab pointed to Johnson’s remark of 19 March, that it would take 12 weeks to “turn the tide” of the virus, saying that was still “broadly the outline”. Alok Sharma, business secretary Originally considered to be part of the cabinet’s lockdown hawks, keen to get business back on its feet, Sharma has pivoted towards a more cautious stance, telling more than 1,000 business leaders in a webinar last Friday that he shared the PM’s concerns about a second wave. In his call, hosted by the Confederation of British Industry, he said lifting the lockdown too early could bring further setbacks to business because of a second peak of the illness and said “that’s the worst possible thing you could do”.
Gavin Williamson, education secretary Williamson is another cabinet member who appears to have rowed back from an initial keenness to end lockdown. He had been described as a lockdown hawk because of his reported concern about the long-term effect that absence from school had on children and was keen to see a phased return to the classroom. However, a government source said the secretary of state totally dismissed suggestions he was part of the hawks group, and in a press conference on Sunday he did not give a date when schools would reopen. Hawks Rishi Sunak, chancellor Sunak has privately been making the case for as quick an end to the lockdown as possible to limit damage to the economy, viewing it as part of his job to speak up about the financial risks of a lengthy shutdown. Internal Treasury projections about the scale of business bankruptcies, unemployment and the depth of the recession to come have caused worries among cabinet ministers. He hinted at this last week in a No 10 press conference, saying he was “deeply troubled” by the effect on the economy. However, sources close to him have also been keen to stress that his first priority is saving lives and protecting the NHS in line with the government’s overarching message. Michael Gove, Cabinet Office minister Gove has been growing increasingly concerned about the economic impact of the lockdown and knock-on consequences for the health of the nation, according to Whitehall sources. He is one of the most outspoken of the four decision-makers in the so-called Quad – along with Raab, Sunak and Hancock – about finding ways to relax restrictions, and is leading a strategic unit in the Cabinet Office to look at ways to get the country moving again. Last week, he was reported by the Sunday Times to have told a meeting of the Quad that he wanted to “run things quite hot” – meaning he would be prepared to lift restrictions as soon as the transmission rate had lowered. One person close to him said they did not recognise the idea of different camps within cabinet and stressed he was supportive of the scientific advice.
Liz Truss, international trade secretary Truss believes that restoring global trade as quickly as possible could be a key way to support the country economically and she would be keen to see lockdown restrictions lifted incrementally sooner rather than later. She is continuing to keep up contact with Singapore, Australia and other G20 countries to hammer home that trade with the UK is vitally important for financial recovery. She is not alone in her views within cabinet, with suggestions that anyone with an “economic department” is naturally aligned with her position."
2020-04-20T18:12:37Z,politics,Politics,How things change – Piers Morgan now the voice of the nation | John Crace,"How things change, part one. Not so long ago, Radio 4’s Today programme was the government’s “Public Enemy No 1”. A media centre of disinformation that needed to be boycotted – preferably shut down completely – because it couldn’t be trusted to allow ministers to tell the first lie that came into their head without some kind of follow-up question or interruption. Since the coronavirus outbreak, Team Boris has had to reconsider its refusal to send ministers on the programme. Even Classic Dom has had to concede that not talking to one of the country’s main outlets is not a good look during a national emergency and has been reluctantly letting ministers out in the wild from time to time. Not that the wild is particularly wild. More like a safari park, as the presenters are so thrilled ministers are no longer an endangered species that they now frequently forget to challenge them. The government can literally send out someone as hopeless as Thérèse Coffey on Today and be fairly sure it won’t come unstuck. How things change, part two. Before Christmas, Piers Morgan was the bete noire of every bleeding-heart liberal. The gobshite Good Morning Britain presenter who shouted down any remainers complaining about the government’s absence of any credible Brexit plan as unpatriotic remoaners. Just suck it up, losers. OK, so Boris Johnson would rather hide in the fridge than talk to Morgan, but a lot of us must have had days like that. Now, though, Morgan has become the voice of a country that is increasingly angry and confused about the way the government has so badly mismanaged the coronavirus pandemic. The everyman who isn’t afraid to use what power he has to call out bullshit and incompetence for what it is. A kind of national group therapy for all those of us who feel powerless. What he does is not so much interview junior ministers – the government has wisely and determinedly kept all its big guns away from Morgan; ITV could clean up with Morgan v Priti Patel on pay-per-view – as harangue and shout at them with all the pent-up fury of someone who doesn’t understand why those in power aren’t more bothered that 1,000 additional people have died in the previous 24 hours. The best that any minister can hope for is to survive the barrage without post-traumatic stress disorder. The luckless Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, was Monday morning’s government sacrificial lamb for the media round. Luckless, because Dowden was never groomed for a cabinet post. He was the perpetual Number Three. A deputy senior prefect at school. The most junior of ministers in government who could barely be trusted to carry a file from one end of Whitehall to the other. A man so dull and ineffective that even his shadow has tried to disown him. That he is now in the cabinet speaks more of the quality of the others than any talents Dowden has so far kept well-hidden.
Dowden warmed up with what he hoped would be an easy gig on BBC Breakfast with the nice-but-dim Dan Walker, the sports reporter turned chat show host whose questions generally make Graham Norton sound like Andrew Neil. Instead, he got the much sharper Louise Minchin, who rattled off a whole load of questions on the absent personal protective equipment and the failure of Johnson to bother to turn up to five Cobra meetings, without making the slightest pretence of engaging with the answers. Because she, like us, knew he didn’t have any. “Thank you, Olivia,” she said, concluding the interview. That’s how little impression Dowden had made on her. She couldn’t even remember his name. Or if he identified as a man or a woman. Over on Good Morning Britain, after a few warm-up punches from Susanna Reid – all of which took their toll – Morgan went in for the kill. First he asked how many NHS and care workers had died. “43,” Dowden said confidently. Actually it was 80, said Morgan, illustrating his assertion by holding up a double-page spread from a morning paper that clearly the minister hadn’t been bothered to read. Hell, it was early and it wasn’t like he had a serious job where it was his business to know the news. OK, Morgan continued. How many care home residents had died? “217,” Dowden replied. Er ... how about 7,500? Morgan said incredulously. Dowden looked like he might burst into tears. That was only just for starters though. Dowden was pummelled and kicked with questions on everything from the government’s insistence it had been brilliantly prepared for the pandemic, to its selective use of scientific data and potentially life-threatening decision to allow the Cheltenham festival to go ahead on 16-19 March. Dowden’s mouth merely opened and closed noiselessly. Every time he tried to come up with some half-truth or excuse, Morgan slammed him back on the ropes. We learned nothing, but then Dowden knows nothing. But it was cracking entertainment. Moments later, Dowden went on the Today programme for some light rest and recuperation before getting another going over from Nick Ferrari, another interviewer who doesn’t take prisoners, on LBC radio. By the end, Dowden could barely remember his own name. Before going back to hide under the duvet, he made one last call to No 10. “Never again,” he begged. “Please let me do the 5pm press conference instead. That’s a complete doddle compared to this.” Raab just laughed and put down the phone. Meanwhile, Dowden went on a fruitless search for what was left of his self-worth."

2020-04-20T17:47:07Z,politics,Politics,MPs expected to approve plans for 'virtual parliament',"MPs are expected to approve historic plans for a “virtual parliament” when they return to Westminster on Tuesday but the new system will fall short of achieving full digital democracy. The proposals will allow up to 120 out of 650 MPs to take part in proceedings at once using the Zoom video conferencing app, while up to 50 will sit in the Commons in person under strict social distancing rules. Some of the more boorish traditions, such as heckling from the backbenches, will no longer take place because Commons officials will be able to control who is heard. Other parliamentary quirks, such as “bobbing” – when MPs stand up and sit down to attract the Speaker’s attention – would be difficult to replicate, Commons officials said.
Screens will be placed around the chamber so ministers and parliamentary staff can see MPs who are taking part in each debate. Signs will indicate where MPs can sit, with tape marks on the floor showing where others can stand. All parties are expected to back the proposals, although few MPs are expected in the chamber for the vote after being actively discouraged by their whips to stay away. Chi Onwurah, the shadow digital minister who first called for a digital parliament to be established last month, said: “I am sure there are going to be hiccups on Wednesday and we have further to go – we should be able to make spontaneous interventions rather than pre-submitted questions. “But it is a huge step forward. We have gone from the 17th century to the 21st century in three weeks.” Chris Bryant, the Labour MP for Rhondda and a former shadow leader of the house, added: “I am glad we can scrutinise ministers but I’m a little anxious about the new system because it is the crowd in the chamber that sometimes forces ministers to explain themselves. Remoteness may take all the energy out of the proceedings.” If the proposals are voted through as expected, they will be used for the first time at Welsh questions on Wednesday morning, just before prime minister’s questions. Labour has not yet said whether Keir Starmer will take part, while Dominic Raab will represent the government in Boris Johnson’s absence. Once the new system has been used, the house will consider whether the model should be extended to debates on motions and legislation. A decision is expected later on whether to move to a system of remote voting. Virtual committee meetings have already taken place."
2020-04-20T11:30:05Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel bullying row: ex-Home Office chief launches tribunal claim,"Priti Patel is facing legal action under whistleblowing laws after her former permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam lodged an employment tribunal claim on Monday saying he was forced from his job for exposing her bullying behaviour. Rutnam claims he was constructively dismissed from his role as Home Office permanent secretary after informing the Cabinet Office that Patel had belittled officials in meetings and made unreasonable demands on staff. The development will increase pressure on Patel, who has denied claims that she bullied civil servants in three government departments, and on Boris Johnson, who has publicly backed his home secretary. She is also the subject of a Cabinet Office inquiry into her behaviour. It is the first time that Rutnam has said he will make a claim of “protected disclosure” under whistleblowing laws and the first time that a secretary of state has been sued by a former permanent secretary. Another consequence of a whistleblowing claim means that instead of a ceiling of £85,000 on Rutnam’s claim, there will be no upper limit to any damages he might receive. Announcing the start of the legal action, the general secretary of the civil service union the FDA, Dave Penman, told the Guardian: “This morning Sir Philip, with the support of his legal team and the FDA, submitted a claim to the employment tribunal for constructive dismissal and whistleblowing against the home secretary. Sir Philip will not be making any further comment at this time.” Rutnam’s claim is expected to focus on Patel’s treatment of senior civil servants in the Home Office. According to reports, a senior Home Office official collapsed after a fractious meeting with Patel. Patel is understood to have successfully asked for another senior official in the department to be moved from their job. Rutnam subsequently wrote to all senior civil servants in the department highlighting the dangers of workplace stress. He also made clear that they could not be expected to do unrealistic work outside office hours.
After a report in the Times highlighted tensions between Rutnam and Patel, sources close to Patel were quoted in several newspapers as saying that Rutnam should resign. An article in the Times said he should be stripped of his pension, another in the Telegraph said he was nicknamed Dr No for negative ideas, while one in the Sun compared him to Eeyore. At that time the prime minister’s official spokesman said Johnson had full confidence in the home secretary and in the civil service, though the same guarantee was not given to Rutnam specifically. Rutnam resigned on 29 February, reading a hastily arranged statement outside his home. In the statement, he accused Patel of orchestrating a “vicious” campaign against him, of lying about her involvement in it and of creating a climate of fear in her department. Rutnam is expected to be represented by Gavin Mansfield QC, the head of Littleton Chambers and an employment law specialist. He will be supported by Clive Howard from the law firm Slater & Gordon. Patel would be expected to appear as a witness, along with her special advisers, and the government would be asked for full disclosure of emails and correspondence between Patel, her staff, the Cabinet Office and No 10. Bruce Carr, a leading QC and former government adviser on employment legislation, said the significance of a whistleblowing claim was that the compensation would be uncapped, unlike an ordinary unfair dismissal claim. “Rutnam will have to show that he made a ‘protected disclosure’ – such as a disclosure of information showing there has been a breach of a legal obligation. This could include an allegation that others had been bullied, which would amount to a breach of their contract of employment. It could also include an allegation that a minister had breached the ministerial code,” he said. The ministerial code states: “There must be no bullying and no harassment.” A Cabinet Office inquiry into the allegations of bullying and Rutnam’s resignation is being carried out by Sir Alex Allan, the prime minister’s independent adviser on ministers’ interests. He will decide whether Patel broke any rules. However, the final say rests with Johnson, who can overrule Allan and keep his findings secret. Despite holding one of the four great offices of state during a national pandemic, Patel has rarely been seen in public since the allegations of bullying emerged in February. She has made one appearance at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, and was criticised after saying she was sorry if people felt there had been a failure to supply sufficient personal protective equipment to NHS staff. A government spokesperson said: “We do not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.” Patel’s office has been approached for a comment."

2020-04-19T15:43:30Z,politics,Politics,"Impossible for UK to meet Covid-19 testing targets, scientists say","The government’s target of carrying out 100,000 Covid-19 tests each day by the end of the month has come under criticism from senior scientists, who say it will be impossible to reach. Experts told the Guardian that a “macho” focus on headline-grabbing figures had been pursued at the expense of rigorous science. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, said on Sunday that the government was confident that the goal of 100,000 tests daily by the end of April would be met. However, scepticism is building. On Saturday, only 21,626 tests were carried out. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said he viewed the target as impossible. “I cannot see that being achieved,” he said. “It was always designed to be a headline grabber rather than anything else.”
Others said a relentless focus on the number of tests performed each day had led to basic data reporting standards falling by the wayside. Prof Sheila Bird, formerly of the Medical Research Council’s biostatistics unit at the University of Cambridge, said: “The level of incompetence in reporting these tests is outrageous.” Gove acknowledged on Sunday that the target referred to tests carried out. In the past fortnight the government has placed a growing emphasis on “testing capacity”. It said that although fewer than 22,000 tests were performed on Saturday, labs now had the capacity to carry out 38,000 tests daily, and this had not been fully taken up by hospitals. Scientists said the distinction was misleading as the logistics of having enough doctors and nurses on the ground to perform swab tests and send off samples continued to be a challenge. “Having the capacity is just the first step,” said Bill Hanage, a British epidemiologist based at Harvard. Bird said the failure to give breakdowns of how many tests were being carried out on patients in hospital, critical workers and family members of critical workers made it impossible to extract prevalence rates of infection in these different groups and other crucial information that would allow scientists to more accurately assess the status of the outbreak in the UK. “This macho thing about the number of tests done each day is leading to a reporting standard that makes the data almost uninterpretable,” she said. Ideally, she said, tests would be reported separately for these different groups and would take into account the fact that hospitalised patients typically have a sequence of three tests over several weeks – an initial positive test followed by two negative tests (the second negative for assurance that the recovering patient is no longer infectious and can be transferred home or to a general ward). “Reporting the number of tests performed each day is a political requirement, not a scientific requirement,” she added. Hanage said that even if the 100,000 target were met, this figure was not a relevant measure of the adequacy of the UK’s testing operation. “Aiming for a large number that sounds good is not the way you should be doing this,” he said. That around a third of those tested in the UK this week had positive results suggests that, while useful for guiding medical treatment, current testing is far below the levels that would be needed for population surveillance. “The data I’ve been seeing suggests there’s not anywhere near enough testing,” Hanage said. “The way you should be doing it is to build the capacity and ability to run large numbers of tests – enough that only 10% are coming back positive.” The World Health Organization has repeatedly urged governments to pursue testing and tracing, and some countries, including Singapore and South Korea, have successfully used this approach to contain their outbreaks, while Germany has also continued to carry out contact tracing. The UK abandoned population testing and contact tracing in early March, when case numbers began to rise steeply, but the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said on Friday that contact tracing would be reintroduced, including through a proposed NHS smartphone app. Experts say the ability to rely on this approach to safely exit the lockdown will depend critically on widespread population testing beyond the level needed for diagnosing patients in hospital."
2020-04-19T07:30:32Z,politics,Politics,"A year on, did Change UK change anything?","Hard as it is to imagine now, in the early part of last year there was a belief – somewhat desperately expressed – that a new politics might be possible in Britain. One not based on the two “legacy” parties, but that might be open to compromise, a certain fluidity of structure, pragmatism. The idea coalesced around a slogan, “politics is broken”. The question was, how to fix it. One solution was proposed by a breakaway group of MPs, eight from Labour, three from the Conservatives, whose new party – the cumbersomely named Independent Group for Change or Change UK – was accepted by the Electoral Commission 12 months ago this week. Both of the main parties were in disarray, propping up leaders for whom there was no love in parliament. The government had recently suffered the biggest defeat in parliamentary history on the “first meaningful vote” on Theresa May’s doomed Brexit deal. If there was consensus on anything, it was that something had to give. At the time of the formation of the new party, YouGov asked a poll question: “Would you say that British politics is working well or poorly at present?” Eighty-two per cent of respondents said poorly. The poll suggested a number of possible remedies. The most popular, with 73% agreement, was: “Parties and politicians trying harder to work together and reach compromise.” This finding was directly contradicted, however, by another solution: “Parties and politicians trying harder to stay true to their core beliefs” (57%). It was in the space between these two demands that the new party was conceived, and in which it quickly floundered. In retrospect, the brief flame of the Independent Group – this time last year 18% of voters said they would vote for it in a general election – is illuminated by a few memorable images. There were, to begin with, the tentative speeches of the “magnificent seven” breakaway Labour MPs – Mike Gapes, Ann Coffey, Chris Leslie, Chuka Umunna, Gavin Shuker, Angela Smith, Luciana Berger – who stepped forward, one after the other, led by Berger, eight months pregnant, to offer heartfelt explanations why they could no longer be a part of a Corbyn Labour party. They were joined overnight by Joan Ryan, then the following day by three Conservative MPs – Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen, Sarah Wollaston – who, naively as it turned out, dubbed themselves “the three amigos”. Certain collective pictures became memes. There was the photo opportunity in which all 11 stared up to the heavens as if the sky might be the limit. There was a selfie from an evening in which they gathered self-consciously for a cheeky Nando’s, and Twitter pored over the signifiers (“The difference is the last supper only had one Judas”). And there was the morning when they took their places together in the House of Commons, waving to potential comrades trying to avoid their eyes on either side of the aisle. The caption seemed to want to read: come on in, the water’s lovely! In the last few weeks, I have been speaking to some of those who were at the heart of that rebellion, on and off the record, conversations that have emphasised that cliche of the past seeming like another country. My questions really, boiled down to one: did Change UK change anything?
Those who were keen to talk – and several were keener not to reopen that recent wound – dated the beginning of the party to way before last spring. Mike Gapes, 27 years a Labour MP, long-time chair of the Foreign Affairs select committee, said the start for him was back in 2015, when Jeremy Corbyn was elected party leader. At the time Gapes was recuperating after two months in hospital with a heart problem. Recovery influenced his desire above all to be true to himself. He agreed with Umunna, who says that by the beginning of 2018, it had long since become “unconscionable to stand on a platform sponsoring someone to become our prime minister who I believed threatened our economic and national security”. Anna Soubry, the Nottinghamshire MP who had become the firebrand voice of the People’s Vote on the Tory side, ascribes her motivation to the lies told in the name of the Vote Leave campaign. “It felt that anyone who refused to go along with a hideous populist agenda was just either ignored or howled down. We still need voices that say: Excuse me, that is not how we do things in this country!” Gavin Shuker, who had represented his home constituency for nine years, dates the genesis to a meeting at the Luton Hoo hotel between himself and Gapes and Chris Leslie, the former shadow chancellor, at the beginning of 2018. “In the 2017 general election,” he says, “many Labour MPs went around telling people on the doorstep that they could vote for us as candidates because there was no real danger of Corbyn getting in. We all knew he was completely unsuitable for office. My feeling was, after the result in 2017, that loophole was closed.” At that meeting at Shuker’s house it was discussed how plan A was still to fight and reclaim the Labour party. It was also agreed that there needed to be “some people thinking what plan B might look like”. Shuker had worked as an organiser in the church prior to entering parliament. He saw his role as “creating the psychological space” in which people might leave the main parties. On this basis he started to have conversations over coffee with 40 or 50 disgruntled Labour MPs. Their responses ranged, he says, from “Thank goodness someone is saying it” to “I agree with everything you’ve said, but I have five years to pay off my mortgage”. Gapes, who had been in the trenches with Neil Kinnock “fighting Trotskyists and tankies who wanted to take over the party” in the days of Militant, now believed the coup had happened. He kept a little diary of his thoughts. “The questions that kept cropping up for me back then were,” he says: “Do you run away? Do you wait for them to come for you? Or do you do something to make a difference?”
The answer was made for him after he “vented on a WhatsApp group of friends about antisemitism and some kind person gave that to the Times,” he says. “The fact was, though, that all of us had our own reasons. For me it wasn’t about Brexit. It was antisemitism, Corbyn’s foreign policy, the deplorable comments about the Skripal poisoning.” At the same time that Shuker was sounding out Labour MPs, Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie, who had shared an office at Westminster, were having conversations with likely Tory MPs. Brexit had fractured party loyalties. Umunna was not sure at that time how many Tories would join them. “They were two to three years behind Labour in being hijacked by an ugly populism – in their case, of the right – and it was hard to tell when that would happen, to what degree,” he says. Several prominent Tory MPs told him “that they would hop on board” if it looked like Change UK would succeed. “But this was a bit chicken and egg – unless a critical mass of MPs defected from the main parties and joined, it would not succeed.” Soubry was among those to take the leap, partly on the understanding that Umunna would lead the new party. She saw Umunna as a potential prime minister. “Abso-bloody-lutely,” she says. “I genuinely believed that.” She spoke to a number of Tories about the idea of resigning the whip. Several wavered, but the two that eventually agreed were Wollaston and Allen. While the Brexit votes and debates were at loud-hailer volume within and outside Westminster, the commitment of various dissenters was being tested. A series of three clandestine meetings, two-day overnight gatherings, were organised by Shuker at a farm in East Sussex for the “20 or so” Labour MPs who were then seriously considering defection. The first time they all sat down for dinner, “there were people in tears around the table”, Shuker says, as members discussed abandoning a lifelong commitment to the Labour movement. At the time the thinking was not to form a new party, Gapes says, at least not yet. “We thought of it in terms of trimesters,” Shuker recalls. “The first trimester was the one we were in. The second would be as an independent parliamentary group, which would go on as long as possible while we agreed how to do the technicalities. The third would be as a political party, which meant that we would be judged by those standards. In the event, the second and third of those phases collapsed into each other and we obviously failed.”
That language of gestation was pointed. As Gapes observes, they had, in Berger’s pregnancy, a very real deadline to make the change – it had to happen before she departed on maternity leave. “That helped to sharpen it,” Shuker says, “and in February a parting in the clouds emerged.”
Secrecy was paramount. “I told my mother, a lifelong Labour member, that I was going to make a big announcement on TV, but I didn’t tell her what it was,” Gapes, 67, says. “I didn’t tell my brother, a lifelong trade union activist. Mainly because I didn’t want anyone to talk me out of it.” Those I spoke to can still just about recall the heady optimism of that moment of departure – hundreds of thousands of people signed up online as supporters, donations started flooding in. For Soubry, if there is one thing that changed everything, it was watching Luciana Berger stand up and be counted.
“I think that will stand as the iconic moment,” she says. “Luciana was very striking, heavily pregnant, and the sight of her saying she had left the party that had been her life because as a Jewish person she had been hounded out… I think that was the moment that completely destroyed Corbyn’s chances of ever getting elected.” Even at the time of the Nando’s summit, Soubry was adamant in her faith that she was joining a new party led by Umunna. She still believes that things might have been different if the former Streatham MP had taken on the responsibility as promised. “He had the chance on more than one occasion and he chose not to do it,” she says. She never had an explanation.
Umunna rejects the idea that he reneged on any promises to lead, saying that the proper time to settle the question of leadership would have been in the autumn of 2019, once the group had a proper structure. Shuker puts that reluctance to take responsibility down to the planned progression of the trimesters. For the new group to get any traction, it needed as many defectors as possible. “People would say, this sounds attractive, but I don’t want to hitch my future to one person’s vanity project,” Shuker says. “Chuka is someone I respect and am still friends with. At one point I had to give him a list of 20 people who were telling me that they would not join a political party led by him, because they thought there should be a more collaborative process. A flatter structure.” That flatter structure quickly came up against the Electoral Commission. The group reckoned they had maybe a one-in-five chance of becoming a real political force, but if there was an early election “they would probably be screwed”. When the party formed it was far from clear that the UK would take part in the European elections planned for May – constitutionally it appeared absurd. When the EU insisted that in the absence of a Brexit deal Britain must take part, however, the group was forced drastically to accelerate its plans. “We had no organisation. No membership. No name,” Gapes recalls. “We tried to register ourselves as the Independent Group and the Electoral Commission would not allow that. So we then became the Independent Group for Change Not ideal. We had a good logo, but that was rejected because it had a hashtag in it. And we imagined we could share the leadership, but the Electoral Commission insisted on us naming one leader.”
Heidi Allen, the least experienced of the MPs involved, who had been selected for the safest of Tory seats in South Cambridgeshire in 2015, was installed as a compromise interim leader. “Heidi had some great qualities,” Gapes says, “but she was completely inexperienced as a campaigner.” Having selected a list of 70 candidates from 3,500 applicants in a frenzied Easter weekend of interviews in a London hotel suite, there was immediate confusion about whether to collaborate with other parties. Acting on dubious promises of a united Remainer front, Gapes says, “Heidi started telling people to vote tactically for the Greens or the Lib Dems. And of course the Lib Dems set out to kill us and they ruthlessly did so, as they have done to others in the past.” Umunna suggests that he knew the writing was on the wall as soon as they had to fight the election, which was a “lose-lose” decision. Until then, he says: “We presented no threat, and even traditionally Tory-supporting media were favourable, because they admired the stand we had taken against Corbynism and the hard Brexiters. However, as soon as we registered as a party, the entire establishment – Labour and Tory – turned their fire on us.” New parties might survive many things, Shuker suggests, but they cannot survive ridicule. “The ambition when we launched was to get to the end of the week without becoming a punchline. And we did that pretty well. But you get one shot at forming a political party and if you end up in the calamity that was the European election campaign, where we literally did become the punchline, there was no coming back from that.”
The new ideals of consensual politics did not work in the heat of media scrutiny of a campaign. The street fighters in the group who had prevailed in marginal seats over the years came up against those who had a slightly dewy-eyed faith in a “movement” in which things could be done differently. The split was generational as much as ideological. Soubry suggests that “those with deep experience of winning tough elections – Mike, Joan Ryan, Anne Coffey – were elbowed out a bit”. Far from modelling a new politics, the group started to look like they had brought with them the ingrained habits of rats in a sack. “There were a lot of egos,” Shuker says. “At one point I brought in FTSE 100 executive coaching to try to get the group to realise that the biggest threat we faced was holding on to the culture they had left behind. But then you found that some people could not resist going back to the old ways of anonymous briefing to the press and so on.” Umunna puts those clashes down to the inability of some in the group, including himself, to understand the cultural difference between “making the weather in one of the two main parties” and “surviving as a third force”. The result of the European elections, in which the group polled 3.4% of the vote, was a fatal falling out, with old friends Umunna and Leslie on opposing sides. “We were a group of 11 that split into two taxis,” Shuker says. “Which is a bit embarrassing.” After the results came through, there was a showdown, Gapes says, between the six who wanted to close the party down – Ummuna, Allen, Berger, Smith, Shuker and Wollaston – and the other five older hands who thought they should battle on. Parliamentary politics after all was as fluid as it had ever been. “But the six decided no. There was no mention in any of that, of anyone joining the Lib Dems. None whatsoever,” Gapes says. (That is not quite how Umunna remembers it, he says, in that he “didn’t rule out” the possibility.) Within weeks, all of those who left, apart from Shuker, joined the Liberal Democrats. Soubry became the reluctant leader of the remaining five. Over the following months, her most significant role in that capacity was to sit in on meetings that tried to resolve the impasse over Brexit. At one point in October, as prime minister Boris Johnson dissolved parliament and tried to keep open the idea of no deal, it seemed likely that an interim government might form. “But the thought of me going back to my group and saying ‘Right guys, the plan is we’re going to rally behind Jeremy Corbyn’ was never really going to happen,” Soubry says.
At the general election in December, not one of the original 11 defectors was elected. Does Soubry regret their efforts? “Not for a moment,” she says. “I think truthfully, I’m now 63, I was 62 at the time. I didn’t have a mortgage to pay. But the people with real courage were the ones like Chris Leslie, who gave up a potentially great career in the Labour party, and who did have mortgages to pay.” She still believes that the forces that produced their party will “come back and bite. We can’t have a situation where the prime minister is surrounded by sycophants and there is no credible opposition. If Starmer does prove he is the man who can reform the Labour party, then there is some hope. But if he is unable to do that – and I fear he will not be able to stand up to the Trots – then we really have problems.” What does she make of those who so obviously swallowed their principles – I mention Nicky Morgan, though she doesn’t – for the promise of reward? “There are a few where you think, how do they look themselves in the mirror?” she says. “I assume they say: ‘I did the right thing for my family.’ But if you are in politics that can never be enough in my view…” She plans to write a book about her experiences. “It’s funny,” she says, with a laugh. “After the event, a very senior Labour politician said to me: ‘Why didn’t you just speak to me first and I would have told you what Chuka is like.’” Umunna himself, at 41, is more philosophical about the defeat. He’d never been fully accepted by the Labour membership, and saw Change UK as a last political throw of the dice in a way. He knew if it did not work out there would be offers for him to resume his former legal career in the city. “I was,” he says now, “determined to be out of politics by the time my children [his eldest is three] reached an age where what I do would encroach on their lives in ways they were aware of – I think it is incredibly challenging to have a parent in politics, with all the abuse and threats they see you subject to.” He insists he has no intention of returning to stand for parliament, but remains proud that each one of the group followed their conscience. Mike Gapes also went down fighting at the election. Did Change UK change anything? “I think we had a moment when we could have made a difference,” he says. “Even in the autumn if Corbyn had been big enough to say, I will stand aside for an interim prime minister, whether that was Margaret Beckett or Ken Clarke, that could have been a game changer. But a Johnson-against-Corbyn election was always going to be a no-brainer.” At his constituency after the count, Gapes got up and talked about the Labour party’s proud history. “I said I was sad that it was led by a man who was unfit to be prime minister but that I was glad that the British people agreed with me.” Gavin Shuker was among those – along with Chris Leslie – who had more to lose than most from his rebellion. When we spoke, he was in the middle of self-quarantine as his partner had mild symptoms of the virus; he was not finding that lockdown was conducive to job-hunting. Still, he believes standing up for his principles was the most rewarding experience of his political life. He has been spending his afternoons, like all of us, watching the briefings about coronavirus. “People might ask me in 30 years ‘what did you achieve in your time in politics?’,” he says. “I’m no fan of this government obviously. But still, I will be able to say I helped prevent Jeremy Corbyn from leading us through a huge national crisis. And to be honest, I’ll take that.” • This article was amended on 19 April 2020. The original version referred to a meeting taking place at Gavin Shuker’s home in Luton, rather than at the Luton Hoo hotel."
2020-04-19T06:25:30Z,politics,Politics,Labour party faces financial peril over leaked report,"More than a dozen people are drawing up legal action against Labour, after they were named in an incendiary leaked report that threatens to plunge the party into financial peril. Claims covering the Data Protection Act, invasion of privacy and libel are all being considered and could be submitted to the party as soon as this week. The party, individuals and some media commentators are all said to be the subject of legal complaints as a result of the document’s release and remarks made about its contents. The row caused by the 860-page document has been a huge blow to Keir Starmer’s hopes of uniting Labour under his leadership following years of infighting. It claimed that factional hostility towards Jeremy Corbyn contributed to the party’s ineffective handling of antisemitism complaints and undermined its 2017 election campaign. It also included criticisms of the party and some of its leading figures by staff members in private messages. Since it emerged last weekend, some of those mentioned in the document have contacted lawyers, with each person said to be considering several different claims. It exposes Labour to a potentially huge bill should it lose in court or opt to settle.
John McDonnell, Labour’s former shadow chancellor, has said the report was commissioned by general secretary Jennie Formby and put together by the party’s governance and legal unit. It was due to be submitted to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission investigation into antisemitism in the party, but that move was blocked by Labour’s lawyers. Mark Lewis, a lawyer who has been contacted by those seeking legal action, told the Observer: “There are lots and lots of claims. There are claims under the Data Protection Act, there are claims for breach of confidence or invasion of privacy and there are claims for libel. It is a very lengthy report that mentions a lot of people. I’ve been contacted by 15 people. Each one of them could well have several claims. What is going on is phenomenal. It’s a bit like the soldiers leaving a barracks that they have to desert and setting it on fire. “For four years, people in Labour have said there is no antisemitism in the party, it’s just a smear. Now they say that of course there was antisemitism, ‘but it just wasn’t us’. They have not noticed the absurdity of their change of position. There are actions against the party, actions against individuals, actions against commentators. People need to be careful about statements that have been made. If this bankrupts the Labour party or individuals, so be it. Actions have consequences.”
One of those considering legal action, who asked not to be named, said: “Several of us are already in detailed conversations with a number of legal teams. The Labour party had made serious allegations about our behaviour. These allegations were never put to us and not a single one of us did anything other than to work towards the best possible result in the 2017 election. Many of us are now being subjected to horrendous online abuse directly as a consequence.” Formby has told party staff that the inquiry into the report, ordered by Starmer and deputy leader Angela Rayner, will examine how it was commissioned, the culture it reveals and who leaked it. Local party branches have been ordered not to share it."

The warning came in response to new guidance from Public Health England, revealed by the Guardian on Friday, which instructs healthcare workers to reuse disposable PPE and recommends that medics wear aprons if they are unable to access full-length gowns. There are growing concerns that some PPE supplies are dangerously close to running out. The UKâ€™s hospital death toll rose by 888 in the last 24 hours to 15,464. Broken down by devolved administration, the figures stand at 13,918 in England, 893 in Scotland, 534 in Wales and 193 in Northern Ireland. The Queenâ€™s 94th birthday on Tuesday will not be marked in any special way because the monarch felt it would be â€œinappropriate in the current circumstancesâ€�, a Buckingham Palace source said. It is thought to be the first time the occasion will go unmarked by gun salutes. Councils across England are to receive an extra Â£1.6bn in funding to help them cope with increased pressures brought about by the pandemic, the local government secretary Robert Jenrick announced. The funds would help councils fund services including adult social care, childrenâ€™s services, waste collection and care for the most vulnerable people. An additional Â£300m would also go to the devolved administrations using the Barnett formula. Close family must be able to attend funerals and cemeteries and graveyards must remain open, Jenrick said. As long as physical distancing was adhered to, family member must have the opportunity to say goodbye to their loved ones, he said. All parks are to remain open, but people must continue to abide by physical distancing rules, Jenrick said. Parks were vital for maintaining the mental and physical health of people for whom the lockdown was even harder, such as those with less living space or without a garden. Arcadia Group may permanently shut stores closed by lockdown.

2020-04-18T14:36:29Z,politics,Politics,Ending lockdown: UK government accused of underestimating public,"Ministers are underestimating the British public by refusing to disclose their lockdown exit strategy, senior Conservative MPs have said. Former ministers and current Tory backbenchers have called for the public to be given greater clarity over the lifting of restrictions, saying that the government’s argument that it would “confuse the message” is incorrect. Former Brexit secretary David Davis said that there was “no argument for not debating and discussing with all the facts available”. “Other countries have been very open about what they’ve done,” he said. “There are lots and lots of benefits of being open about this. The argument that was put, that we don’t want to confuse the message, I think is just wrong. It underestimates the public. The public understand that there are phases to this.” Davis also called for the data underpinning the government’s strategy to be made public. Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said on Saturday that the government should respect that the British people were “capable of recognising what they need to do in lockdown”. He said the government needed to “bring the British people into its confidence”, and that the public had “already shown a remarkable level of common sense”. “[The public] want to know, businesses and small businesses particularly, how will we come out so they can start making plans, and I think it would be right for the government to look at that,” he said, speaking on BBC news. He also accused the government of treating people “like children” by refusing to discuss exit strategies.
“The government is going to have to accept and admit we are coming out of lockdown. We need to trust the British people and not treat them like children,” he told the Times. “We must respect their common sense. They need to know that the sun is rising at some point, in an economic sense.” Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Commons defence select committee, said that the best way to ensure public cooperation with the government was to keep people informed. He said a “general road map” spelling out the lockdown measures, but without a timetable of how they would progress, would be “well received” by the nation.
“What we need is strategic clarity as to what happens next, and that’s what I’m calling for,” he said. “My concern has been that there has been a clarion call for an exit strategy when the government must make clear there is no exit from this until a vaccine is procured and delivered to a sizeable proportion of the population, therefore the longevity of this needs to be managed.” “Letting the nation know what is coming round the corner helps keep minds focused and people on board,” he added. Ellwood admitted that the prime minister’s absence had been a “real setback” in communication with the public, describing Boris Johnson as “the best communicator in government”. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, also blamed the government’s lack of information on the end of lockdown on Johnson’s absence, a claim which the spokesperson for the prime minister said was “just wrong”. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “The government has already set out five clear tests to consider before making any adjustment to its approach. “At all times we have been consistently guided by scientific advice to protect lives. The current advice from Sage is that relaxing any of the measures could risk damage to public health, our economy, and the sacrifices we have all made. “Only when the evidence suggests that it is safe to do, and the scientific advice provides for it, will we adjust these measures.”"
2020-04-17T17:38:20Z,politics,Politics,"Coronavirus UK live: Sharma announces vaccine taskforce; hospital death toll rises to 14,576 – as it happened","The chancellor Rishi Sunak announced that the job retention scheme â€“ the multi-billion coronavirus 80% wage subsidy â€“ will be extended by one month until the end of June. The scheme is due to formally open on Monday next week, although payments will be backdated to 1 March. The extension amounts to an immense spending announcement, perhaps costing the Treasury Â£10bn or more. Ministers reportedly believe that keeping the scheme going through the summer and beyond would be simply unaffordable. The government has set up a vaccine taskforce to find a coronavirus vaccine, the business secretary Alok Sharma announced at the daily press conference. He called producing a vaccine a â€œcolossal undertakingâ€� that would take many months and there was no guarantee of success. The health secretary Matt Hancock was unable to give MPs assurance that some hospitals wonâ€™t run out of gowns this weekend. This came on the same day the Guardian learned that NHS bosses have asked doctors and nurses to work without full-length gowns when treating Covid-19 patients, as hospitals across England are set to run out of supplies within hours. The government will meet on Tuesday to discuss whether to recommend a change in policy on face masks. Sadiq Khan has been lobbying the government to change its advice on wearing masks to members of the public. Appearing on BBC Breakfast, the mayor of London urged the public to wear non-surgical masks when they go out, particularly on public transport and in shops where it isnâ€™t always possible to stay 2 metres apart. He was backed by the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer who said he thought he was â€œinevitableâ€� that the government would have to start advising people to wear masks in certain circumstances, in step with changes taking places across Europe. Booking summer holidays at this time would be a mistake, the transport secretary Grant Shapps said, highlighting that while there are signs that the curve is flattening there has yet to be a decline.

2020-04-16T19:38:20Z,politics,Politics,From psycho killer to suburban Rotarian in one slow heartbeat | John Crace,"On Thursday we saw a rather different Dominic Raab. For every other appearance fronting up the daily Downing Street press briefing, we’ve had the Colonel Kurtz foreign secretary. The full-on madman with vein throbbing in his forehead. Ready to mix it with his own shadow and now so far gone he was almost longing for the police to arrest him. Now, though, Dom was a great deal more chilled. Even to the point of being totally boring. He could make a more than acceptable de facto prime minister yet. It’s amazing what a 7% solution of beta blockers and Mogadon can achieve. From tense and nervous and I-can’t-relax psycho killer to suburban Rotarian in one very slow heartbeat. No need for anyone to run, run, run, run, run, run, run away. This was Raab as the chartered surveyor who had received a series of unexpected promotions simply by turning down every project as being too risky. That way, he would never get to be proved wrong. Dom: the Man who likes to say “No”. There again, Raab had managed to slow down both his metabolism and his thought processes so much that he was now actually at least seven days behind the rest of the country. On the plus side, he’s still got a sunny Easter weekend to look forward to. It’s been evident to anyone with the hint of a pulse for over a week now that there was no chance of the government lifting any of its lockdown measures anytime soon. You’ve only had to see the daily fatality figures to know that. But Dom still managed to make the announcement as if it was breaking news. Perhaps it was to him. Mind you, Raab did hedge his bets a bit by saying that the restrictions would initially remain in place for another three weeks. It sounded as if he was hoping the prime minister might be back in action by then, so that it would be Boris Johnson and not him who would have to break it to a stir-crazy nation that the three weeks might then turn into another three weeks. And then another three weeks after that. Clearly the government believes the country can only take three weeks of bad news at any one time. Shame Boris rather gave the game away last month by saying the quarantine could last three months. No one should be making too many plans for before the end of June at the earliest. The foreign secretary had also cannily taken a leaf out of Matt Hancock’s book. Two weeks ago the secretary for health and social care – that’s the bit he tends to forget about and gets tacked on as an afterthought – had grandly announced his “Five Pillars” for the NHS that sounded authoritative and had gone down well with the public. Even though no one – not even Tigger – could any longer remember what any of those five pillars had been. So Dom decided to go big, think outside of the box even, by coming up with his Five Tests that would determine the basis on which the government would consider easing restrictions. Information that had hitherto been considered so top secret that neither Rishi Sunak nor Hancock had been able to share it with the nation when asked at press conferences earlier in the week. So here was Raab, playing it straight and looking the country directly in the eyes. Even if his own were half closed due to the near lethal cocktail of drugs he had injected half an hour earlier. First, things would have to get a bit better in some areas. Second, things would have to get a bit better in other areas. Tests three, four and five followed along similar lines. The Five Tests were literally what anyone could have worked out for themselves. At another time, it might have been a worry that it had taken the cabinet so long to state the obvious. But nowadays we have become accustomed to have “being dim” and “slow react” priced in to every government decisions. The briefing had always been meant to be dull and matter-of-fact, to lure everyone into a state of narcolepsy. But realising it had been rather flatter and more depressing than intended and that there were still no answers as to why Germany and South Korea appeared to be handling the crisis so much better, Raab belatedly tried to find a few positives. The health secretary had finally remembered care homes existed and was going to get each and every one of them to pay for a shiny, superhero Green Badge that could instantly repel the coronavirus. Towards the end, Raab became slightly punchier as the drugs wore off. Though he couldn’t bring himself to wholly defend the World Health Organization – he might get ticked off by Donald Trump or Boris if he did – he did say that the UK might have to rethink its relationship with China once the crisis was over. This on the same day the prime minister’s press spokesman had said the UK would be better off dealing with the pandemic without being held back by EU regulations. Hell, if he felt like that why not go the whole hog and scrub the facade of the trade negotiations and end transition now. Fantastic. The UK’s answer to a global catastrophe was to go it alone. Who needed some vaccine made by foreigners? This was Britannia Unchained. Now where had Dom heard that phrase before?"
2020-04-16T18:54:57Z,politics,Politics,Slimmed-down ‘virtual House of Commons’ to sit next week,"A slimmed-down “virtual House of Commons” featuring ministers in the chamber being questioned by MPs via video link is set to convene next week after Commons authorities agreed to the idea. The scheme, the first time part of the Commons will have sat remotely in its 700-year history, will allow up to 50 ministers and backbenchers to physically be in the chamber at any one time, with up to 120 appearing on screens. Those in the Commons would sit at a distance from one another to minimise the risk of transmitting coronavirus. The video-conferencing element will use the US-made Zoom system, despite worries about its security. The House of Commons commission, which made the announcement, said the National Cyber Security Centre had advised Zoom would be usable “if the installation and the use of the service is carefully managed”. The House of Lords is also scheduled to hold remote sittings from next week, a subsequent statement from the upper house said, using Microsoft systems.
MPs are due to return from the Easter recess at 2.30pm on Tuesday. The new system will not take effect immediately, as the measures will first need to be approved by some MPs physically sitting in the Commons. This would mean one of the first new-style events could be prime minister’s questions at midday on Wednesday. The virtual sittings will only be in place for the first two hours of each day, taking in questions and statements. Once the system is seen as working well, the hope is to extend it to debates and legislation. No decision has yet been made on remote voting, which MPs would have to decide on. The statement explaining the new working methods said that while up to 50 MPs could be in the chamber at any one time, it was expected that fewer would attend, and that they would be encouraged to work at another location if possible. If an MP is in the Commons they will only be called to speak if listed to do so, as is the normal procedure.
Screens will be placed around the chamber to let the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, and MPs in the chamber see and hear their colleagues. A new rule dictates that those appearing via Zoom “will be expected not to display or draw attention to objects to illustrate their contributions”, so as not to give any advantage to remote speakers. In the event of a technical failure that prevents an MP from being heard, they will be called later if possible. When the virtual system is being used, there will be no interventions or points of order to interrupt speeches. Similarly, in the Lords peers will only be able to ask ministers questions, and to listen to and respond to ministerial statements and private notice questions, and contribute to non-legislative debates. For now, again, debates on legislation will be limited to physical settings. The Lords is next due to sit on Wednesday. The Commons commission, which is responsible for the administration and operation of the chamber, is chaired by Hoyle. Other members include Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, his Labour shadow, Valerie Vaz, and Pete Wishart of the SNP. The commission statement said the hybrid model “was developed at speed and chosen as an achievable first step towards a virtual parliament, having the benefit of meeting current technological capacity”. In a statement, Hoyle said he wanted MPs and staff to remain socially distanced and not attend parliament unless necessary. “By initiating a hybrid solution, with steps towards an entirely virtual parliament, we are enabling members to stay close to their communities, while continuing their important work scrutinising the government,” he said. “I do not want members and house staff putting themselves at risk. By working virtually, this is our contribution to the guidance of stay home, protect the NHS and save lives.” Rees-Mogg said the measures would help parliament scrutinise the executive, authorise spending and makelaws, “all of which are essential to tackling coronavirus”. He added: “I am extremely grateful to Mr Speaker, for showing the leadership necessary to make this happen; to the parties, who have worked together constructively to ensure next week’s business will run smoothly with the minimal necessary attendance in Westminster; and to house staff, for working so hard over the Easter break to make these changes technically possible.” Efforts are being made to minimise the number of staff who will need to be at Westminster, and no visitors will be allowed."
2020-04-16T12:34:56Z,politics,Politics,Scheme for EU citizens to stay in UK draws 3.4m applications,"The Home Office has received 3.4m applications from people seeking to stay in the UK after Brexit under the EU settled status scheme. It puts the government close to its overall goal for the scheme, with estimates of the number of EU, EEA and Swiss citizens eligible to remain in the country lying between 3.4 million and 3.8 million. However, monthly data, which was published on Thursday, shows there is still a backlog of 320,000 applications and researchers at Oxford University have warned that many citizens may “fall through the cracks”. EU citizens in children’s homes, care homes or those who are victims of domestic abuse, where others may not be aware or allow them to apply, have been cited previously as among those at risk. Detailed breakdown provided by the Home Office shows there were 125,000 applications to the scheme in March. This brought the overall number of applications received up to 31 March to 3,468,700, including approximately 180,000 non-EU nationals who are family members. The total number of applications concluded was 3,147,000. Of those 58% were granted settled status and 41% granted pre-settled status. Of the remaining applications 10,000 were invalid and 600 were refused, 98% of which were on eligibility grounds and 2% on “suitability grounds”, said the Home Office. The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said in a report, Not Settled Yet, published on Thursday, that there was no way of verifying whether the government was reaching its goal because there was no official means of doing so, as no registration system existed before for migrants. Madeleine Sumption, the director of the research unit, warned that the government could relax thinking it had captured data for all of those eligible to remain in the UK when many may not apply at all.
“The government has invested a lot of effort in making the EU settlement scheme easy to use,” she said, “but with any scheme of this size it is inevitable that some people will fall through the cracks. It will be very hard to know to what extent this has happened, without a parallel investment in new data. “For a host of reasons, it’s possible that the number of EU citizens granted status through the scheme could greatly exceed the current official estimate of 3.4 million but that wouldn’t necessarily mean the task is finished.” The campaign group the3million said it had concerns that some of the more complex cases were now taking up to six months to resolve, creating anxiety for many families whose lives were put on hold. It also expressed concern over the lack of information about refusals. “We have gone from ‘nobody is being refused status on eligibility grounds’ to hundreds of refusals per month, without knowing why cases are being refused,” said Maike Bohn, one of the group’s co-founders. “The real question is how many people have not applied, and the government simply doesn’t know it. Every single EU resident to miss the deadline of 30 June 2021, for whatever reason, will automatically lose their legal status in the UK. It is crucial we know how many, who, and where they are – but we have no data that would allow us to establish this.” The data puts Polish citizens at the top, with 665,000 applicants, but it has been estimated previously there are about a million Poles in the country. Some returned home after Brexit. Romanians are the second highest number of applicants by nationality, at 564,300, followed by Italians at 351,600 and Portuguese at 273,000. The Home Office said there was still more than a year left until the deadline and if someone had reasonable grounds for missing the deadline, they would be given a further opportunity to apply. It also pointed out that the scheme would open beyond 30 June 2021 “not just for those with reasonable grounds for applying late, but also to accommodate those granted pre-settled status, who will be able in due course to apply for settled status, and close family members living overseas at the end of the transition period (and children born after that date) who later join a resident EEA or Swiss citizen here with status under the scheme”. • This headline and first paragraph of this article were amended on 16 April 2020 to clarify that 3.4m was the number of applications received; this is not necessarily the same as the number of people who have applied for settled status."
2020-04-16T08:39:24Z,politics,Politics,"UK needs lockdown exit strategy, says key coronavirus adviser","Downing Street needs to accelerate planning for exiting the coronavirus lockdown because contact tracing, testing and social distancing will be needed “indefinitely” until a vaccine is discovered, Prof Neil Ferguson, one of the leading epidemiologists advising the government, has said. Ferguson, whose team at Imperial College provided the modelling that led to the lockdown, said data suggested infections were coming down but life would not get back to normal quickly after the lockdown is eased. As ministers prepare to extend the lockdown for three weeks, attention is turning to what happens when it might be possible to ease the restrictions. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, expressed extreme frustration about being asked to explain the government’s exit strategy in broadcast interviews on Wednesday, saying: “Everybody wants to know what the future looks like. The question is how do we best get through the crisis and how do we get the numbers down.” He added: “The thing is this: how we communicate as government, as ministers, has a direct impact on the cases we have and the people who die. Because clarity of messaging that people need to stay at home ... that saves lives. This core messaging has a direct impact on how many people follow the guidelines. The scientists can say what they like, the commentators can say what they like, but we will do our best by dealing with this virus.” Hancock said Ferguson “advises government, he is not in the government”. Ferguson said he would like to see the government move faster to put a plan in place for what happens when measures are partially lifted, saying he did not see the same level of planning going on that was put into Brexit.
Ferguson told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There’s a lot of discussion. I would like to see action accelerated. I don’t have a deep insight about what’s going on in government, but decisions need to be accelerated. We need to put in place an infrastructure, a command and control structure, a novel organisation. “I’m reminded we had a department for Brexit for government. That was a major national emergency and we are faced with something even larger than Brexit. And yet I don’t quite see the evidence for that level of organisation. I’d like to see measures accelerated.” The Guardian reported on Wednesday that there was no central plan for exiting the lockdown yet, even though ministers have been floating ideas about which parts of the population might have restrictions lifted first – from younger people to the immune or different sectors of the economy. Ferguson said it was necessary to ease restrictions at the right time but added: “We will have to retain some level of social distancing indefinitely until we have a vaccine available.” He said there now needed to be a “single-minded emphasis on scaling up testing and contact tracing”. He argued that a huge infrastructure of testing and contact tracing would need to be in place in order for the lockdown to be lifted without further peaks, pointing to the model of South Korea, which has been suppressing new outbreaks. “Without that, our estimates show we have relatively little leeway. If we relax measures too much then we will see a resurgence in transmission,” he said. Ferguson’s remarks suggest he believes the UK should return to a strategy of containment, which was abandoned by No 10 and its chief scientific and medical advisers early in the epidemic, to the concern of public health experts. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, is one of those who has been arguing for weeks that mass community testing and tracing is necessary, while the government was at that point insisting that a test for antibodies to prove immunity was the most important strategy. Since then, antibody tests have proved hard to develop with any accuracy. Ministers have been trying to ramp up testing since early March, with a target of 25,000 daily by mid-April and 100,000 daily by the end of the month. Hancock denied the existence of the 25,000 target on Wednesday but on Thursday he claimed the government had now reached capacity to do 25,000 tests a day with the help of new drive-through centres for NHS workers."
2020-04-16T05:00:34Z,politics,Politics,"Gordon Brown on Covid-19, recession and Trump: 'When there’s a crisis you have to act quickly'","From the window of his home study, Gordon Brown looks out across the waters of the Firth of Forth, towards the ramparts of Edinburgh Castle. It is a precious glimpse of open horizons, in a world closing in. The former prime minister is holed up here hitting the phones in search of what he considers the missing piece in the coronavirus jigsaw: a coordinated global pooling of resources against the pandemic and accompanying recession. No government can honestly claim to be doing “whatever it takes” – the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s refrain, echoing the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, during the 2012 euro crisis – unless it coordinates with governments worldwide, he insists to me over the phone. “Each country will say: ‘We’re doing what we can’,” he says. “Each country might even say: ‘We’re doing the best we can.’ But nobody can say: ‘We’re doing whatever it takes’ unless you bring people together – the key decision-makers, the key governments who can finance this. That’s when confidence comes back to the world economy and that’s when people think things can be brought under control.” Leading Britain through the 2008 banking crisis taught him, he says, that it is not just about money, but showing you have diagnosed and gripped the problem. Brown’s fear is that while we struggle with the first wave of infection, the foundations for a second or third or fourth are being laid, as coronavirus hits developing countries terrifyingly ill-equipped to suppress it. Covid-19 is taking hold in countries with struggling health systems, where some lack running water to wash hands, and where the choice is between risking infection by going to work or going hungry.
“I’ve talked in the last few days to the prime minister of Ethiopia, the president of Sierra Leone, people in Ghana – they all know they have got a coming problem and in some cases it’s already there,” says Brown. Helping them prevent disaster is not only right, he suggests, but in our own interests; so long as infection lingers anywhere in the world, it will keep coming back to countries who think they have beaten it. “This is not some abstract globalist thing,” he says. “None of us are going to be properly safe until all countries are free of this.” So, what does he make of Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw funding from the World Health Organization (WHO) mid-pandemic, seen in some quarters as an attempt to distract from the president’s handling of the outbreak in the US? “It’s illogical, it is counter-productive, it’s really sabotaging the efforts to coordinate global health and it’s an act of self-harm because it will rebound to hurt America,” he says, bluntly. “If the next wave of the virus comes out of Africa because the WHO and others have not been able to help them contain and suppress the disease, then no doubt President Trump will blame Africa and demonise them as well as the WHO.” Yet he hopes the US may still fund some arm’s length WHO initiatives on coronavirus, and insists he hasn’t given up on a global response: “I still don’t rule out getting countries round the world to bring China and America back into cooperation.” Brown has persuaded more than 200 ex-leaders and ministers, economists and medical experts to back detailed proposals for global cooperation that he hopes will make the agenda of this week’s meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. The open letter they have signed calls for a global pledging conference where governments could collectively agree to fund the search for a vaccine, treatments, ventilators and personal protective equipment worldwide. Instead of competing for scarce stocks, Brown wants countries to cooperate in boosting supply for all. “I’ve got no doubt if there was greater global coordination you could solve many of the problems that we face in this country – but also other countries are facing – about the lack of test kits, the lack of protective clothing, the lack of ventilators.” The letter also calls for a taskforce of the G20 group of powerful nations to agree assistance for developing countries, plus joint interventions to stop a global recession becoming a 1930s-style depression. “The fear people have is that a liquidity crisis in companies becomes a solvency crisis, and a recession becomes a depression and that’s what we have got to avoid,” says Brown. “Action can be taken to minimise the number of weeks and months the economy is closed down, or at least partially closed down, but the international action is important.” The economic repercussions of the virus are, he thinks, “bigger than the global financial crisis and there’s no doubt that they are as big in some countries as the Great Depression”. He flatly refuses to criticise Boris Johnson’s handling of the epidemic, from shortages of protective clothing to the timing of lockdown. But isn’t his letter tacit recognition that current leaders are failing? He sighs. “I don’t want to look back on what decisions have been made, I want to look forward to see what decisions could be made in the future. We aren’t trying to criticise, we are trying to encourage.” The convalescing prime minister, he insists, has his sympathy. “I feel sorry for Boris Johnson, because at the moment, when the greatest call upon executive action is being made, he’s found himself out of it. That must be very frustrating and very sad.” Asked if he’s in touch with Johnson, his stand-in, Dominic Raab, or Sunak, Brown says only that he’s “talking to people who are in touch with the decision-making in government”. Isn’t he frustrated, lacking the power to do what he feels needs doing? A burst of laughter, which I suspect disguises a yes, rolls down the line. “I’ve got a few ideas that might be able to be helpful, but I’m not claiming anything else.” Yet this strikes closer to home than he cares to admit. It’s when I ask how he is coping personally with lockdown that he momentarily falters. “For me it’s uh … you know, we had to protect our son so we had to take action quite quickly.” Gordon and Sarah Brown’s son Fraser, 13, has the lung condition cystic fibrosis and government advice is to shield sufferers from the virus. It is a sensitive subject, the Browns guard the boys’ privacy fiercely (they also have an older son, 16-year-old John). Brown doesn’t want to discuss how this affects his political mission, but eventually says gruffly: “What I do know is all of us have had to deal with a crisis at one point in our life, so you do feel whenever there’s a crisis you have got to act quickly. That’s what’s motivating me at the moment.” We are on safer ground discussing the books getting him through lockdown. He’s just ordered the novelist Linda Grant’s latest (he found her 2000 book When I Lived in Modern Times, the story of a Jew from the East End of London moving to what was then Palestine, “amazing”) and is ploughing through policy proposals to retrain people out of work during lockdown. At 68, he scoffs at the notion of retiring: “Nobody retires now!” But nor does Brown crave a comeback. When he surfaced on the BBC’s Today programme in March, a wave of nostalgia surged through Twitter and he got some “very generous” messages from the public. But while Tony Blair remains a political player, Brown doesn’t regret leaving London to live quietly in his old constituency of Dunfermline East after losing the 2010 election. “I used to say my best advice is not to take my advice,” he jokes. “I’ve not involved myself in business or anything else and I’ve not interfered in the Labour party. I’ve just tried to do what I can to help various causes. I don’t think former leaders should claim any special privileges or insights. There may be occasions when your experience is of use but you should be modest enough to realise that you’ve got a new group of leaders and it’s their time.” He has discussed his proposals with Labour’s new leader, Keir Starmer, but “it’s up to him to decide what he wants to do. I wish him well. I think he’s an excellent choice.” He tweeted that Starmer’s was the team that could return Labour to power, so why does he think Starmer can succeed where Jeremy Corbyn failed? “Because Keir’s very good,” he begins, before spotting the trap and declining to discuss domestic politics. Why does he think countries have been initially slow to cooperate against coronavirus? “In the first few years after 2010 there was a sort of defensive nationalism – protectionism, tariffs, building walls, people putting import controls down. I think in the last year or two, it’s been a more aggressive nationalism,” he says. “We’re dealing with an atmosphere that is a problem. But I think people have got to stop re-running the debate between globalists and nationalists. This is about saving lives.” Brown reckons a moratorium on debt interest repayments owed by the poorest countries could, for example, release £40bn for health and social protection. “That’s almost a decision that if you made today, the countries could act on it tomorrow.” But some will surely need IMF bailouts, reliant on richer countries’ willingness to finance them. During the banking crisis, Brown was working 20-hour days, knowing that if his recapitalisation plan failed and banking collapsed then anarchy could follow. What advice can he give leaders operating now under similar pressure? “For me, it was a huge challenge. You know people didn’t always agree with the way I did it ... but you’ve got to quickly understand what’s needed to be done, and then you’ve got to mobilise every possible resource to do it. Some of the methods you use are controversial, but you’ve got to take the widest possible view.” His mistake, he suggests, was succeeding in emerging from recession, but failing to convey the case for running a fiscal deficit to do so. “You’ve always got to be thinking of what happens next. In Britain at the moment we’ve got to get out of the immediate crisis, but then you’ve got this issue of which companies are going to survive after you’ve solved the medical problem.” This Gordon Brown is mellower than the rather defensive one I encountered in office, perhaps as a result of no longer being constantly attacked. If it hurts to see the Tories lauded for turning Keynesian overnight, it doesn’t show. “The irony is that 10 years ago, the conventional wisdom was that running a deficit, as Keynes had argued in the 1930s, wasn’t fashionable,” he says philosophically. “I think we were right then and I think people accept that we did the right thing, but we got penalised for it. Now there’s a better understanding that if economic activity in your economy collapses then the only organisation that can come in is the government. To be honest, it’s sad that what happened in 2010 led to austerity and everything else, because that was the inevitable consequence of not understanding that you had to run a fiscal deficit to deal with the problem.” Brown won’t say how the current bailouts should ultimately be paid for, but thinks one legacy of the virus may be greater aversion to risk. “There’s climate change, there’s cybersecurity issues, nuclear proliferation issues. People in this generation are going to be more aware that the balance of risk and security has to be examined and that will raise questions about what people expect of government.” If anything, he thinks enforced separation under lockdown has encouraged such solidarity. “Being isolated, people realise the need to be connected, the importance they attach to friendship, the importance of acting as a community.” After years of separatist political movements, from Scottish independence to Brexit, is this crisis illustrating the dangers of separation? “It becomes a moment where we have got to make a choice,” he says. “If we can’t cooperate on this, then it doesn’t say much about the world and I do think people in the end will.’” And so I leave him to his phone calls; cloistered from the world now, but forever looking out."
2020-04-15T20:36:30Z,politics,Politics,Hancock's shiny badge? Emblem of a scamper into Tigger mode | John Crace,"Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Or perhaps not. Matt Hancock had been expected to give the previous day’s Downing Street press briefing but got pulled in favour of Rishi Sunak, following the publication of Office for Budget Responsibility’s report suggesting GDP was set to tank by 35% over the next three months. So you might have thought the health secretary would have used the extra 24 hours to fine-tune his announcements on social care. Not so much. Over the past few weeks Hancock has been one of the few cabinet ministers to look even vaguely competent, but today he let his department down, he let his country down, but worst of all he let himself down. And there’s nothing worse than a Tigger who lets a Tigger down. The best he can do now is go home to watch a replay of his press conference and cry himself to sleep. Hancock began by praising 99-year-old Captain Tom Moore for raising £7m for the NHS by walking round his garden. As well he might. For that £7m probably represents roughly the sum of what the Conservative government has taken out of the NHS each day over the past 10 years or so. Certainly, the legendary Chris Grayling has managed to waste twice that in a single visit to the despatch box in the Commons. Thereafter it was all downhill. I am here to tell you the next steps in our social care package, Tigger bounced. Which was news to everyone as up till now even the first baby steps had been kept a closely guarded secret. When Boris Johnson became prime minister he assured the country he had a social care package ready and waiting to go. To go precisely nowhere, as ever since we’ve heard precisely zilch. Nada. Social care for the elderly still appeared to be the government’s lowest priority even during a coronavirus pandemic that disproportionately affected old people. So here was the deal. More workers and care home residents would be getting tested and there would definitely be more personal protection equipment available. Though starting from a baseline of near zero this wasn’t quite the earth-shattering announcement that Hancock had led everyone to expect. But luckily, Tigger was planning on saving the best till last. Because he knew that what social care workers really wanted wasn’t testing, PPE, more money or a home secretary who dismissed them all as low-skilled. It was a shiny new green badge, saying CARE, that he was proud to model. A badge. A sodding badge. Even the writers of the TV series The Thick of It wouldn’t have dared come up with something as crass as this. Especially as it was a badge that had already been launched a year previously to the general indifference of everyone in the care home sector. This was Tigger’s Who Wants to Be a Millionaire moment. He was sorry that no social care workers had won the jackpot this week; the producers were withholding the £1m top prize because they suspected cheating had taken place as there had been a lot of background coughing during the recording of the show – but as a gesture of goodwill, and to make sure no one went home empty-handed, he would be giving every contestant a badge. And a Tigger cuddly toy. Hard to believe, but the badges really were the high point of the entire 45-minute briefing. Hancock looked genuinely dismayed that the media weren’t quite as wowed by them as he was – Fighting Corona, a Badge at a Time – and he rather went into meltdown during the question and answer session. First he made out that the reason testing levels had actually fallen in recent days was because NHS workers were far too busy sunning themselves in the park during the Easter Bank holiday weekend and they couldn’t be arsed to come in for a test. You can only imagine the conversations that must have been taking place all over the UK. “Shall I go and get the test for which I’ve been begging for for weeks? Or shall I just not bother and top up the tan?” Hancock also appeared to be clueless as to why the government was seemingly unable to give even a hint of what criteria it would be using when considering a possible relaxation of the lockdown rules. There was no strategy to have a strategy. The best he could come up with was that different governments were at different stages of preparation so it would be wrong to make any comparisons. The strong implication was that our government was still at the “completely hopeless” stage of preparation so we shouldn’t be holding our breath for any news any time soon. This is a decision that appears to be well above everyone’s pay grade, including the prime minister’s. Even that wasn’t the nadir. Matt can’t go out to meet the press without having a plan of action involving numbers. Last time out he had a five-pillar plan, almost none of which had yet to happen. So why should anyone believe a word he said now? Laura Hughes, of the Financial Times, gently pointed out that he had promised 25,000 daily tests by the middle of April and we were still down in the 16,000s. Which made the 100,000 promise in two weeks’ time look totally unrealistic. Here Tigger lost the plot. It was all a big lie. A conspiracy. He had never said 25,000 tests by the middle of April. FAKE NEWS. He had said 25,000 by the end of April which he had then increased to 100K. So just wait and see. He believed he could fly. He believed he could touch the sky. Mystic Tigger. Unaccountably, Hughes was the only journalist not granted a supplementary question in which she could nail the inconsistencies in his memory. Instead, he bounced out the room, kissing the badge in triumph. And there we all were thinking it was the bear who had the little brain."
2020-04-15T18:44:57Z,politics,Politics,Labour’s Iain McNicol steps down from Lords role after report leak,"Labour’s former general secretary Iain McNicol has stepped down from the party’s frontbench in the House of Lords while an investigation is carried out into claims former senior officials sought to undermine Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. Lord McNicol was nominated for a peerage by Corbyn after resigning as general secretary in February 2018. An 860-page report, which was leaked to Sky News at the weekend, includes lengthy extracts of private WhatsApp conversations between former senior Labour staff in which they are scathing about leftwing MPs and advisers – and Corbyn himself. Its release risks reigniting factional tensions just as the new leader, Keir Starmer, seeks to underline the need for party unity. The report includes allegations that some officials set up a secret project during the 2017 general election to funnel campaign funds to selected candidates’ seats, including that of the then deputy leader, Tom Watson – and were disappointed at the party’s unexpectedly strong performance. And it suggests there was “abundant evidence of a hyper-factional atmosphere prevailing in party HQ in this period, which appears to have affected the expeditious and resolute handling of disciplinary complaints”. McNicol is repeatedly mentioned in the report – and as general secretary, he oversaw Labour HQ. His decision to stand down as a Labour whip followed the announcement by Starmer of an independent investigation. A spokesman for Labour in the Lords said: “Iain is stepping aside while the investigation is taking place.” James Schneider, Corbyn’s former director of strategic communications, said the report was “shocking and clarifying”. He went on: “It suggests that some of those most responsible for the failure to deal with antisemitism in the Labour party, which has frightened Jewish people and damaged the party, worked against the elected leadership and tried to shift the blame. “There must be a reckoning for those who oversaw a system that allowed Holocaust deniers to remain in the party and deliberately undermined the chances of a Labour government.” Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the Unite union, condemned the “rancid, and very cruel, political culture” exposed in the report, and called for former officials implicated to be suspended from the party. Writing on the website LabourList, McCluskey called for the leaked report to be published in redacted form – and suggested some of the former officials named in the report should be suspended while investigations were carried out. “Where there is clear evidence of a party member having engaged in misogynistic or abusive conduct, or having worked to undermine the party’s election campaign, or even having broken the law, there is a case for suspension pending a thorough investigation (with no presumption of guilt),” he said. He added: “These politically crooked officials were prepared to risk dramatic damage to the interests of the British economy and working people just in order to scratch their factional itch.” As well as apparently working to undermine Corbyn’s leadership, the report cites officials using a string of insults on private WhatsApp groups to describe leftwing MPs and officials in the then leader’s office. Diane Abbott is referred to as “repulsive”, with another official saying she “literally makes me sick”. Corbyn’s senior adviser Seumas Milne is referred to as a “mentalist”, and Corbyn’s chief of staff, Karie Murphy, as “Medusa”, “crazy”, and a “bitch face cow”. Jon Trickett, who was Corbyn’s election coordinator in 2017, said: “There are comments in there which it is hard to avoid the conclusion were racist and sexist.” He added: “There are serious questions that are going to have to be answered. We have to have an explanation.” The report appears to have been intended as a lengthy annexe to Labour’s submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission – but after party lawyers decided it was not relevant, it was leaked. It was completed this year in the final months of Corbyn’s leadership and its conclusions clash with claims by whistleblowers, formerly working for Labour, who told BBC Panorama last year there had been political interference in the process from the top of the party under Corbyn. The EHRC is investigating Labour’s handling of antisemitism complaints. Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner, announced on Monday that they had commissioned an independent review into the report’s content, and how it had found its way into the public domain. Speaking about the report on Radio Four’s Today Programme, Starmer said he was “shocked by what I saw and the circumstances in which it all came about” “That’s why I ordered an independent inquiry, which I want to be professionally done, independently done and quickly done because our party needs to unite and face the future and get back to our historic purpose which is getting a Labour government in so we can actually change lives for millions of people for the better.” “We have to turn our back on factionalism and that was the whole basis of my leadership campaign,” he added. “I’m determined to do that.” Some of the senior officials cited in the report said they were considering taking legal action about the fact it had been publicly released, saying it contradicted non-disclosure agreements signed when they left the party. “Everyone’s consulting lawyers,” said one of those involved. The Labour MP Clive Lewis, who is referred to in one message by a member of Labour staff as “the biggest cunt out of the lot”, urged Starmer to get to grips with the culture inside the party. “We need to change the culture of our party, and that’s the challenge now for Keir and Angela,” he said. “For many members, who don’t see themselves as on the left or on the right, they will be thinking: ‘A plague on all your houses.’” He added: “The leadership have a narrow path to tread on this. They will need to make sure that they are dealing with this in an even-handed way. If there’s any sense that there’s favouritism being shown to one side or another, then that will be problematic.” The previous Labour leadership’s handling of allegations of antisemitism against party members overshadowed parts of the 2019 general election campaign. During a high-profile televised interview with Andrew Neil, Corbyn repeatedly declined to apologise to the British Jewish community for the way his party had handled complaints."
2020-04-15T18:02:26Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus live: Hancock wants to ensure right to say goodbye; Whitty says death toll reaching its peak,"The health secretary Matt Hancock said he wants to ensure that loved ones can be with people who are dying of coronavirus. At the daily government press conference he referenced the case of 13-year-old Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab who died alone and said he wanted â€œclosest loved onesâ€� to be able to be there, wherever possible. All patients being discharged from hospital into a care home will now automatically be tested for coronavirus, the prime ministerâ€™s spokesman said in the lobby briefing. And all care home residents with coronavirus symptoms will also be tested. The spokesman also said that 6,000 care homes had already been offered the chance to test their staff and all care providers will have been approached with the same offer by the end of the week. Hancock also refused to accept he had promised to deliver 25,000 tests per day by now. On 18 March the government committed to increasing the rate of coronavirus testing to 25,000 within four weeks. Today is exactly four weeks from the day that press release was issued, but that target has been missed. The UK government refused to directly criticise President Trumpâ€™s decision to freeze funding for the World Health Organisation. The prime ministerâ€™s spokesman told the lobby briefing the UK would continue to support the WHO, but he declined to say anything critical about Trumpâ€™s stance. The UKâ€™s death toll appears to be reaching its peak, Prof Chris Whitty told the press conference. But high numbers of deaths will continue and they still donâ€™t know what the transmission rate is, he added. They need to know more before relaxing physical distancing measures can be considered. The number of deaths in hospitals across the UK rose by 761 to 12,868. This was slightly down on the further 778 deaths reported yesterday. Northern Irelandâ€™s lockdown will remain in place for the next three weeks, the first minister Arlene Foster announced. She said it was important to continue to do â€œeverything we can to reduce the peakâ€�. Almost two thirds of graduating students have had job applications paused or withdrawn due to the coronavirus pandemic, a survey of more than 5,000 students found. Some 63% of would-be graduates said their applications had been put on pause or withdrawn because of the virusâ€™s continued spread and only a third felt confident about finding a job after the pandemic.

2020-04-15T17:06:19Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock's record on NHS coronavirus provision,"Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has been the government’s public face for much of the coronavirus crisis, especially since Boris Johnson became ill. As such he has made pledges in a series of key areas – how do they measure up so far? Testing What he said: 2 April: “I’m now setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day by the end of this month. That is the goal and I’m determined we’ll get there.” 10 April: “I can announce today that we have capacity for all key social care staff and NHS staff who need to be tested to get those tests.” Where we stand: The latest daily total for tests, with two weeks to go before the end of the month, is just 14,982, less than 15% of the target, with 12,081 carried out by NHS laboratories and 2,486 by the government’s commercial partners in drive-through centres. Personal protective equipment (PPE) for health and care staff What he said: 23 March: “I am determined to ensure that the right kit gets to the right hospital, the right ambulance service, the right doctors’ surgery, right across the country. There have been challenges and I can see that. We’re on it and trying to solve all the problems.” 10 April: “We need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource it is. Everyone should use the equipment they clinically need, in line with the guidelines: no more and no less.” Where we stand: Despite significant government efforts to improve the flow of PPE, there are still regular concerns that hospital staff, and especially workers in care homes, do not have sufficient supplies. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said this week that while the great majority of PPE was arriving on time, some gaps remained: “It would help if those gaps were publicly acknowledged and the reasons for them more clearly set out.” Ventilators What he said: 15 March: “We’ve got high quality engineering in this country and we want anybody who has the manufacturing capability to turn to a manufacturer of ventilators to do that.” 5 April: “At the moment we have between 9,000 and 10,000 ventilators within the NHS right now and we have the 2,000 spare that are critical care beds with ventilator capacity should people need to come into them and we’re ramping that up. Our goal, instead of the 30,000, is that we need 18,000 ventilators over the coming two weeks.” Where we stand: There are 10,120 available ventilators, with around 1,000 acquired from the private health sector and the rest from imports and orders from small suppliers. None of the ventilators designed by non-medical engineering companies such as Dyson have yet been approved for use. Intensive care What he said: February (from NHS England statistics): There were 4,122 adult critical care beds open and 3,342 occupied, giving an occupancy rate of 81.1%. 12 April: “The latest figures show that in Great Britain we have 2,295 spare critical care beds, up 150 from yesterday.” Where we stand: Other figures from 13 April said there were 3,228 patients in critical care beds. That would make a total of 5,523, an increase of 1,400 places, and an occupancy rate of 58%."
2020-04-15T16:57:21Z,politics,Politics,EU and UK government to resume post-Brexit talks next week,"The European Union and UK government have agreed to resume post-Brexit talks next week, where they will confront entrenched divisions on trade and fishing rights over video link. The two sides released a timetable for the next three rounds of negotiations in an attempt to get coronavirus-disrupted talks back on track, following a video conference on Wednesday between the prime ministerâ€™s chief negotiator, David Frost, and his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier. Following Brexit day on 31 January, the EU and UK managed only one round of talks before coronavirus crashed them. There were two cancelled sessions and the lead players were put into isolation. Barnier came down with coronavirus in March and has recovered. Frost, who had â€œmild symptomsâ€� of the virus, is no longer self-isolating. While the two leads were confined to their homes, the EU and UK continued working on draft legal texts, but progress ground to a halt. In a joint statement, the two sides said recent technical work had been â€œuseful to identify all major areas of divergence and convergenceâ€�, but they agreed there was a need to organise further talks â€œin order to make real, tangible progress in the negotiations by Juneâ€�.
The next round will begin next week, with further talks scheduled for the weeks of 11 May and 1 June. Agendas for the negotiating sessions have not yet been published, but are expected to cover the 11 key topics of post-Brexit talks, including trade, security policy and fisheries. During the video call, Frost told Barnier the UK did not intend to seek an extension to the 11-month transition period, which ends on 31 December 2020. Yet EU diplomats are increasingly convinced that London will ask for an extension, as the fallout from coronavirus hammers the global economy and consumes political energy across Europe. Any decision to extend the transition must be agreed by both sides by 1 July and would require a deal on new payments into the EU budget. The transition period â€“ which keeps the UK in the EU single market and customs union without voting rights â€“ can be prolonged for up to two years, but only once. As the clock ticks down, EU diplomats are dismayed the UK has failed to produce a draft legal text on fisheries, despite a goal to agree on fishing rights covering 100 shared species by 1 July. The absence of a UK text is perceived as an attempt by the British to gain the upper hand by attempting to delay difficult issues until the last minute. EU sources insist there will be no agreement on anything without a deal on fish. The two sides have not narrowed their differences on any of the major sticking points, such as agreement on common environmental, social and competition law standards for free trade, or the role of the European court of justice. Last Friday the UK handed two legal texts to the EU, covering energy and law enforcement, adding to previous documents sent to Brussels, which cover trade, air safety, air transport and civil nuclear. The British have irritated EU diplomats by denying Barnier permission to share these texts with national capitals. That means the 27 EU member states, who will make the ultimate decision on the terms of the future relationship, are relying on analysis and summaries from Barnier and his negotiating team, rather than the original documents. The commission has published its 440-page draft legal text online, reflecting its longstanding Brexit transparency policy â€“ and the reality that documents rarely remain secret for long in Brussels."
2020-04-15T13:29:14Z,politics,Politics,"Boris Johnson reacted too slowly to Covid-19, says former scientific adviser","Boris Johnson and his advisers have been accused of responding too slowly to the coronavirus outbreak by a former chief scientific adviser, who expressed shock that the Cheltenham festival and other big events were allowed to go ahead in mid-March. Prof Sir David King said he was “really saddened by the predicament we are in” and that the UK “didn’t respond so much sooner once this epidemic broke out in China”. King, who was adviser from 2000 to 2007, said it appeared that there was a plateau in new infections but that the failure to record deaths outside hospitals means “we really haven’t a clue where we are” and comparisons with other countries were “beginning to look really awful”.
With pressure building on the government over the UK’s high number of deaths, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, is expected to announce on Thursday afternoon a lengthening of the lockdown for at least three weeks. The announcement will be made after a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee, which will include the leaders of the devolved nations – Nicola Sturgeon, Mark Drakeford and Arlene Foster. However, Raab is unlikely to say anything about how the UK plans to end its shutdown, despite speculation that certain sectors could be brought back to work, younger people allowed out or schools reopened. On Wednesday, Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, was pressing for the government to publish the outlines of an exit strategy but Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK’s chief scientific adviser, and Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, have both said it is too early to talk about this while the death rate has not come down. King outlined his criticisms of the government’s strategy so far in an interview with LBC radio, where he said a report published on his watch in 2006 showed an outbreak of this sort would spread everywhere in the world within three months because of air travel.
“That, of course, is what has happened – and it seems that we were unprepared and we didn’t take action,” he said. Imagine, 16 March, having a horse race go on with a massive crowd at Cheltenham. We didn’t manage this until too late and every day’s delay has resulted in further deaths in the United Kingdom.” King said austerity under the coalition government had led to cuts to the risk management programmes, which had made the UK unprepared for pandemics. “For me, this is very upsetting because we had set this preparation process in place, as I say, back in 2006,” he said, arguing that this had cost lives. King said the government needed to “massively step up measures” including mass testing, which the current chief scientific advisers and medical advisers had suggested until recent days was not practical. “Until we get testing done on a very much wider scale, we’re not going to begin to manage this,” he said. “If we go around the world and see where there has been better behaviour, it isn’t only in the wealthy countries.
“You go to Greece and the management of the epidemic, starting very, very early on, has been really astoundingly good. Go to Africa, go to Rwanda, you’ll find the same thing. “So I think it has been taking the eye off the ball, hoping that it would somehow blow away and we are acting too late. In rugby terms, this is a hospital pass to anyone in the driving seat at this point in time.” No 10 rejected the criticism, saying the chief scientific and medical experts had previously addressed the claim that the government acted too slowly, saying the measures had been brought in at the right time. At its regular daily briefing, Downing Street said testing for coronavirus was at more than 14,000 on Monday, while capacity was more than 19,000. However, this suggests that the government will miss its target of completing 25,000 tests a day by the end of the week. It also looks far off its ambition of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. No 10 also rejected the idea of publishing the list of names of scientists who sit on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies or minutes of its meetings. The group is the crucial body that gives advice to the emergency Cobra committee, which is due to meet tomorrow to decide how long the UK should extend its lockdown for."
2020-04-14T20:16:56Z,politics,Politics,Instant Coffey not so hot on care home tragedy | John Crace,"Imagine you’re a cabinet minister and you get a late-night call from the communications team at No 10 telling you that you’ve drawn the short straw for the following morning’s media round. Most would mutter “oh shit” and reconcile themselves to a night without sleep as they try to come up with some vaguely convincing answers to possible questions about the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Some might even have switched on the news and realised that deaths in care homes had become a hot topic. Not Thérèse Coffey. She just mumbles a simple “sure thing” and settles down to a good night’s sleep, certain she can wing her way through any interview. Seldom has confidence been so badly misplaced. Last week in her only previous outing, the secretary of state for work and pensions managed to underestimate the number of people claiming universal credit by 200,000. Now she was planning on going full Priti Patel in her desire never to be asked to make another public appearance. First up, she got completely rinsed by Dan Walker on BBC Breakfast. This was the equivalent of being taken apart by La-La of the Teletubbies. No disrespect to Dan, who comes across as a thoroughly likeable man, but he is most at home asking unthreatening lifestyle questions. Yet within minutes of the interview beginning, Coffey was behaving as if she had been waterboarded. “I think we have been well prepared,” she repeated desperately. Though admittedly her definition of being well prepared might be a little different to everyone else’s. Things went rapidly downhill when she squared up to Piers Morgan, on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, and Nick Ferrari, on LBC radio. “How can you not know the answer to how many NHS staff or care home workers have died?” Morgan asked. “I don’t have the answer to that,” Coffey admitted. Which was odd, because many of that morning’s newspaper front pages had precisely those figures. Then it was hard to find any questions to which she did have an answer. She didn’t know how many care home residents had died and she didn’t have a clue why it had been a bad idea to apply for an EU procurement scheme on 24 February but a good one just a few weeks later. In normal times, this could have been a career-ending series of interviews for Coffey. But in the year of the coronavirus such stupidity and incompetence gets forgotten within hours. No doubt all will soon be forgiven and Coffey will be back on the airwaves within a week. And just as hopeless. Still, the government had been clearly rattled enough to send out its star performer for the daily 5pm Downing Street press briefing. Just weeks ago almost no one outside the Tory party – and precious few within it – had heard of Rishi Sunak, but he has now become one of the cabinet’s few beacons of sanity and competence. You just have to suspend disbelief rather. It’s disconcerting to have a chancellor who looks younger than most teenagers and is so small that he has to peer round the sides of the Downing Street lectern as he can’t see over the top. “We must be honest with the British people,” Sunak said with his best honest man-of-the-people face, as he addressed the latest Office for Budget Responsibility forecast. Though not quite so honest that he could actually bring himself to spell out that the OBR was predicting a possible 35% fall in GDP with two million unemployed for the next three months. Only that it was just one forecast that could easily be wrong and even if it wasn’t then he wouldn’t sit around and let it happen. Sunak has already delivered five separate budgets inside two months and you could almost see him writing his sixth and seventh as he was speaking. Many chancellors don’t get to deliver that many in their entire political career. Sunak is on course to easily break double figures by the end of the year. Now was not the time for ideology or orthodoxy, he added, rather pointing out the obvious. Those horses have long since bolted. “It’s not a choice between the economy and public health,” he concluded. Here he was sticking his neck out. There are quite a few of his cabinet colleagues who might beg to differ if they start to see the end of the Brexit transition receding further into the distance. Not all the media shared Rishi’s faith in his own abilities. He might be the best of a bad bunch but the gene pool of ministerial talent wasn’t exactly overloaded. Sunak tried to insist the UK would bounce back and that the government was committed to levelling up opportunities for everyone, but it was hard to see many winners in the coronavirus pandemic other than the hedge fund managers who had bet on a stock market collapse. “We’re all in this together,” Rishi insisted, before bitterly regretting his choice of words. David Cameron had said exactly that back in 2012 and in the intervening years the NHS and public services had been cut and the gap in inequality widened. The chronicle of more deaths foretold. Nor was there much faith in the way the UK reported its statistics, as it was now clear our mortality rate would be higher than France’s if we included deaths in care homes and the community. Luckily, Sunak could palm this off to the two medical officers who insisted this was a blip and that they personally longed for the day when the charts had the UK outperforming Italy and Spain. The most telling question, though, was what they might have done differently in hindsight. On that they were all agreed. They would never have signed up to a daily press briefing. This one will run and run. As they all did for the exit."
2020-04-14T18:14:12Z,politics,Politics,Antisemitism inquiry 'must come before Labour officials hired',"Labour MPs have warned against appointing any senior party officials before the publication of an inquiry into a leaked internal report into antisemitism in Labour. The report alleged that hostility to Jeremy Corbyn had hampered efforts to tackle the problem. In a sign of continued anger over an issue that threatens to disrupt Keir Starmer’s attempts to reunite the party, MPs also said the inquiry should report to Labour’s national executive committee, not to Starmer’s office. One said that any party officials who were implicated should be suspended while the inquiry took place. Thirty MPs from Labour’s socialist Campaign Group released a joint statement Monday evening calling for an inquiry into the report, which they said “contains revelations of senior officials undermining the 2017 general election campaign and suggests there are cases to answer on bullying, harassment, sexism and racism”.
Shortly afterwards a joint statement from Starmer, who is now Labour’s leader, and Angela Rayner, the party’s deputy leader, announced an “urgent independent investigation” into the report and how it was leaked. While the terms and timescale of the inquiry have yet to be unveiled, several MPs on the left of the party have argued that it should be clearly independent; some want a hiatus in top-level appointments. While no names have been mentioned this will be seen in part as a reference to mooted attempts to remove the party general secretary, Jennie Formby, a close ally of Corbyn. The 860-page document, seen by the Guardian, was intended to be submitted as an annex to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission inquiry into Labour’s approach to antisemitism. The document talks about these efforts being hampered by “a hyper-factional atmosphere” in Labour’s HQ, and shows what are said to be leaked WhatsApp messages showing hostility from some officials to Corbyn and his team. Paula Barker, the Liverpool Wavertree MP, who was among those who signed the joint statement, said she was concerned that the announced inquiry did not go far enough, and that while the data protection implications of the leak were important, the inquiry had to look beyond this. “We mustn’t let that get in the way of getting to the bottom of this. There has to be a root and branch investigation. Because at the end of the day, our people, our members or activists, they deserve nothing less than that.” It would, she added, be “inappropriate” to make any senior party appointments during the inquiry. “Whoever may end up at a senior level in our party, I would hope that a robust vetting programme is conducted.” Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the MP for Streatham, who is another signatory to the statement, said action was needed before the inquiry was completed. “Where there is evidence of a clear breach of party rules members expect that individuals are suspended from the party pending an investigation.” She added: “It would not be helpful to appoint anyone named in the report, whilst they are under investigation. It could call into question the outcome of any inquiry, whilst we are trying to end factional tensions, not create even more.” Other MPs, speaking anonymously, reiterated this, and said the inquiry had to be rapid and independent. One said: “It’s got to report to the NEC, and it can’t be dragged out. Members deserve this, and only a firm response will restore their faith in the party.” Another MP said: “It really has to look independent. There’s a lot of feelings of mistrust in the party.” One senior MP said Starmer faced a hugely difficult task over the leaks. “We all knew there was open hostility from some party officials to Jeremy’s side, but to read it in black and white is very sad for a lot of people. “We need to learn from this – it’s just the opening salvo of the two factions fighting again. If Keir isn’t careful he’ll spend the next few years having to be a referee. There’s an argument that the only way through it might be to make examples of people from both wings of the party.” A spokesman for Starmer said: “Keir and Angela have announced plans to set up an independent inquiry. The terms of that inquiry will be spelled out in due course.” Starmer and Rayner later wrote to Labour MPs saying the party’s NEC would set the terms of reference for the inquiry."
2020-04-14T18:06:46Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Sunak warns of 'unprecedented challenge' as questions persist over economy and care homes â€“ as it happened,"The lockdown could shrink GDP by 35% in the second quarter of the year but bounce back quickly and unemployment could rise by 2 million, according to the results of a coronavirus scenario published by the Office for Budget Responsibility. This is not a forecast nor an official government prediction, but a scenario illustrating the possible effects on the economy and public finances of a three-month shutdown and the governmentâ€™s policy responses. The UKâ€™s hospital death toll surpassed 12,000 as a further 778 hospital deaths were recorded, taking the total to 12,107. Actual coronavirus-related deaths could be 15% higher than daily government figures suggest, said an ONS report. Nick Stripe, head of health analysis and life events at the ONS said: â€œThe latest comparable data for deaths involving Covid-19 with a date of death up to 3 April, show there were 6,235 deaths in England and Wales. When looking at data for England, this is 15% higher than the NHS numbers as they include all mentions of Covid-19 on the death certificate, including suspected Covid-19, as well as deaths in the community.â€� Separately, the latest weekly ONS figures suggest 10% of coronavirus deaths are occurring outside a hospital setting. Of those, more than half were in care homes, with the rest in private homes and hospices. The figures cover the week ending 3 April, making them almost two weeks out of date. With the true picture likely much worse, Labour is calling for daily publication of figures showing coronavirus-related deaths in care homes. Two of the UKâ€™s largest care home providers recorded deaths of 521 residents in recent weeks, fuelling claims the official figures are understating the prevalence of coronavirus in care homes. Sir David Behan, non-executive director of HC-One, said Covid-19 was present in two-thirds (232) of its care homes with 2,447 suspected cases and 311 residents had died along with one member of staff. MHA, another leading provider, said Covid-19 had affected about half of its homes and was linked to 210 deaths.

2020-04-13T19:17:09Z,politics,Politics,"Raab sticks to the old 'Non, je ne regrette rien' | John Crace","It’s come to something when Dominic Raab is quite clearly the best person available for the job. With Boris Johnson likely to be out of action at Chequers for the coming weeks, Robert Jenrick getting stuck in transit between any of his three houses, Michael Gove being unable to explain why his daughter is a higher priority for a coronavirus test than a frontline NHS worker – has any situation ever been improved by Mikey not staying at home? – and Priti Patel being Priti Patel, there are few obvious alternatives to Raab to front up the daily Downing Street press conference. Which isn’t to say that Dom is by any means an ideal choice. Practice hasn’t made perfect, but it has made him a bit less rubbish. He’ll never be totally relaxed – his missing-person habit is hard to break – but he is a lot less sweaty and nervy than he was last week when he was visibly struggling. There’s almost a swagger. Albeit one that barely disguises his low threshold for boredom. Because Dom is not dim – well, not compared with many of his colleagues – and the tedium of having nothing new to say has already got to him. He can’t even bring himself to go through the charade of appearing interested. The briefing is just a half-hour ordeal to be endured. Stifling a yawn, the foreign secretary began by thanking NHS staff. Not just for saving Boris, but for all their efforts elsewhere. My guess is that most NHS workers were either too busy or too knackered to have paid much attention. If the government is sincere in its newfound gratitude for a health service that it has been happy to underfund and understaff for the past 10 years, it is going to have to be prepared to alienate its traditional low-tax Tory voters. Not to mention the Brexiters who want many of the immigrants who work in the NHS to sod off. Raab then moved on the daily figures. The death rate was down a bit, but then it always is at weekends, as for some reason the person whose job it is to do the counting doesn’t work on Sundays. He was more indirectly straightforward – Dom can’t do anything without having first out-thought himself – on why deaths in care homes weren’t being included in the daily stats. Because if they were, then everyone would see that many more people were dying than he was prepared to admit. Visibly losing the will to live, Dom also failed to adequately explain why, halfway into the government’s target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, we were still only managing about 18,000. It was like this: the coronavirus was a tricky bugger that spread exponentially. So the only way to combat it was to be even more cunning. Start by doing almost no tests and then take it by surprise by testing exponentially. The reason we were apparently so far behind was to lull the coronavirus into a false sense of security. “This is a national test,” Raab concluded. Really? The whole thing is just an Ant Middleton SAS: Who Dares Wins TV show, where the first country to break the lockdown gets thrown off the course. Silly, silly me. There was I imagining that what we were really dealing with was a global pandemic that required proper scientific evidence, when in reality it was a psycho standoff between us and the virus to see who gives way first. Nor did the questions from the media produce much in the way of straight answers. The government doesn’t yet seem to have even reached a point where there is a plan of what criteria might need to be met to end the lockdown or which groups might be allowed out first. Presumably Raab is still banking on using his black-belt martial arts skills to defeat the coronavirus with a straight ippon. “I’m sorry, I can’t really hear you,” was as far as he got in offering an apology for Priti Patel’s suggestion that most NHS staff were wasting PPE protection at fancy dress parties. So no. He wasn’t sorry at all. Besides, no one was going to be seeing Patel again in the foreseeable future Inevitably – because these briefings always do – the questions turned to why, even without the care home and death-in-the-community figures, the UK was heading for the worst mortality rate in Europe. Was this part of the plan? Raab’s face momentarily turned to panic. No one had ever called what the government had done up till now a plan. More like a “take it a day at a time and hope something turns up” approach. Did the government regret not acting a bit quicker? A month ago, it was advising 250,000 people to get stuck in together at the Cheltenham festival when other countries were in lockdown. Dom was firmly of the “Je ne regrette rien” école. Never explain, never apologise. So what if the death toll was now over 11,000 and rising by hundreds per day? We shouldn’t read anything into South Korea’s low mortality rates, he said, because they weren’t comparing like with like. We were excluding many more Covid-19 deaths than them. We were just doing them a favour to make them look good. But you could be damned sure if it was the UK that was at the bottom of the death charts, the government would be shouting about it from the rooftops. And I, for one, would be applauding them."

Four countries indicate a potential need for personal protective equipment (PPE) “in case of an expanding situation in the EU”. They do not include the UK. 4 February EU countries share observations on the state of supplies of PPE in a meeting of officials from member states and the World Health Organization. An official from the UK attends the meeting in Luxembourg. 24 February A meeting of officials, to which the UK was invited, hears an update from the European commission on the joint procurement of PPE. Commission officials call on countries to confirm “their exact needs latest today … to move forward with next steps”. No representative from the UK attends the meeting. 28 February The EU launches its first joint procurement of £1.2m worth of gloves and gowns/overalls. The UK is not one of the 20 member states involved. 12 March The procurement fails due to a lack of suitable suppliers. It is relaunched on 15 March. The UK is still not involved. 17 March The EU launches two more rounds of joint procurement for masks and goggles and ventilators. The UK is not one of the 25 member states involved. 19 March The UK belatedly takes up an invitation to join the joint procurement agreement steering committee, which makes decisions on mass purchases. The UK does not join a procurement for laboratory supplies that is put out to tender on the same day. 23 March The health secretary, Matt Hancock, admits there have been “challenges” with the supply of PPE after complaints by doctors and nurses around the country. He drafts in the army to help with distribution. 24 March No 10 says it has not joined EU procurement schemes as the UK is not in the EU and is “making our own efforts”. The government later U-turns to say it failed to receive an email inviting it to be part of the initiative. 25 March Health officials from EU countries convene an audio meeting. Representatives of the member states raise the possibility of further procurements and are asked to inform the commission by the following day about their requirements. The UK has been invited to join the meeting, but no representative takes part. 26 March The government says it has 8,175 ventilators, but turns to British industry to help produce 30,000 in a matter of weeks. The engineering company Dyson reveals plans for an entirely new medical ventilator working to specifications set down by the government. 29 March The death of two surgeons from Covid-19, the first doctors to die from the disease, intensifies the pressure on ministers to accelerate the supply of PPE. 10 April Hancock calls on workers to “treat PPE as the precious resource it is” following weeks of criticism, leading to claims that he is blaming medics for shortages. 11 April Hancock confirms 19 deaths among healthcare workers from coronavirus, a day after it was claimed in the daily Downing Street press conference that it would be inappropriate to provide such information. Priti Patel, the home secretary, offers what critics call a non-apology, saying she is “sorry if people feel there has been a failure to supply sufficient PPE”. 13 April Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, says gaps remain and calls for the government to publicly acknowledge the problem and the reason for it. Dominic Raab, deputising for the prime minister, admits to supply problems, saying there is “a competitive market out there”, but declines to apologise."
2020-04-13T18:11:21Z,politics,Politics,'Hybrid' virtual parliament plans to be put to MPs next week,"MPs are expected to be asked to approve plans for a “hybrid parliament” when the Easter recess is over next week, but not a move to full “digital democracy”. The new procedures are likely to involve many MPs submitting questions to ministers via video conference during departmental questions, statements and urgent questions. But MPs who have been involved in talks on how parliament can adapt its proceedings to the need for social distancing do not think the Commons could become fully virtual, and they have found it harder to imagine how legislation could be debated and voted on without MPs attending the chamber. The details of the plans are still being worked on this week. The House of Commons commission, the cross-party body in charge of Commons administration, is due to meet on Thursday to consider options, and it is expected that MPs will be asked to vote in favour of the new procedures when they return to Westminster next Tuesday.
According to one MP familiar with the commission’s discussions, what is being proposed will amount to a hybrid parliament. He explained: “There will be some members in the chamber, and there will be some members who will be contributing digitally.” Throughout the recess, parliament’s digital services team has been putting in place technology that would allow this to work and now insiders are confident that question sessions in the Commons, such as PMQs, could involve many MPs participating by submitting questions electronically, using video conferencing technology. “We will have very, very slimmed-down proceedings – with just a skeleton group of ministers and MPs in the house,” said another commission source. Opposition parties are comfortable with these plans, although there is far less agreement about how the Commons can continue to debate and vote on legislation in an era of physical distancing. Commons debates normally involve speakers taking spontaneous interventions from MPs, which would be hard to facilitate via video conferencing, and MPs have always resisted attempts to get them to vote electronicall instead of in person in the division lobbies. Before the Easter recess the parties agreed to limit the number of divisions they called on legislation and Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, proposed getting MPs to vote in smaller groups, which would have meant a division taking up to 40 minutes, not 15 minutes as now. But these are not seen as long-term solutions to the problems created by coronavirus. In a letter to the Speaker sent last week, Karen Bradley, the chair of the Commons procedure committee, said her committee did not view these plans to limit the number of divisions as sustainable.
She said: “Every colleague is entitled to express an opinion … in debate and in the lobbies. Members of the committee have expressed concerns that the time taken in divisions under the social distancing procedures which you have announced will inhibit colleagues from testing the will of the house as they are entitled to do.” Bradley also said in her letter to Hoyle that, although some MPs agreed that they should be staying away from parliament to set an example, others thought that much of what happened in the chamber “cannot be replicated by virtual means” and that it was necessary for MPs to continue to visit their workplace “in the same way as other key workers”."
2020-04-13T18:01:46Z,politics,Politics,UK missed three chances to join EU scheme to bulk-buy PPE,"Britain missed three opportunities to be part of an EU scheme to bulk-buy masks, gowns and gloves and has been absent from key talks about future purchases, the Guardian can reveal, as pressure grows on ministers to protect NHS medics and care workers on the coronavirus frontline. European doctors and nurses are preparing to receive the first of €1.5bn (£1.3bn) worth of personal protective equipment (PPE) within days or a maximum of two weeks through a joint procurement scheme involving 25 countries and eight companies, according to internal EU documents. The EU’s swift work has led to offers of medical equipment, including masks, overalls and goggles, in excess of the number requested, a spokesman for the European commission said. The EU is separately establishing stockpiles within member states, with the first being set up in Romania.
The development comes as anger grows over PPE shortages in Britain, with particular concerns at the weekend over stocks of full-sleeve gowns running out. The gowns are designed to resist droplets which can spread coronavirus and were shown to be highly effective at protecting medics in Italy. A survey by the Doctors’ Association UK found that only 52% of clinicians carrying out the highest-risk procedures said they had access to the correct full-sleeve gowns, while the Guardian understands that a consignment of at least 100,000 gowns from China had to be rejected when it was found to be substandard. Other consignments thought to be gowns had been mislabelled and were other equipment. On Monday Dominic Raab, acknowledged PPE shortages – rather than distribution issues only – for the first time. The foreign secretary, who is deputising for the prime minister as Boris Johnson recovers from Covid-19, told the daily Downing Street briefing that cost was not an issue but admitted to problems with PPE supply due to “a competitive market out there”. He declined to apologise, saying only that 16m items of equipment were delivered over the bank holiday weekend. “We are straining every sinew to roll them out even further and even faster,” he said. The UK government has previously said it was unable to join the EU’s procurement schemes as it had not received an email of invitation. As a result, the government missed out on mass procurement of medical ventilators, and has called on UK manufacturers to build tens of thousands more. But it has also not been involved in two rounds of bulk purchasing of PPE, which were launched by the EU on 28 February and 17 March. The EU’s procurement of 28 February initially failed due to a lack of interest from suppliers but was relaunched on 15 March, providing additional time for the UK to get involved if it had chosen to do so. It is understood that officials in Whitehall only realised after those three rounds had been put out to tender that they had not received invitations to join the Joint Procurement Agreement steering committee where the orders are organised. The UK only took part in its first meeting on joint procurement on 19 March after informing the commission that emails of invitation were being sent to an outdated address, the Guardian has learned. Despite that belated show of interest, British officials did not attend a separate meeting of health officials on 25 March where participants were invited to spell out their requirements for future purchases to the commission by the next day. The UK is also not involved in joint procurement of laboratory equipment. The EU is also planning joint procurement of therapies for coronavirus, but the UK is yet to state its position on its involvement. Shortages of protective equipment have triggered anxiety, alarm and fear among NHS medics and care home staff. The death toll among doctors and nurses continues to rise, with Matt Hancock, the health secretary, saying on Saturday that 19 NHS workers had died. He said it was “impossible” to say when hospitals would have all they needed but added: “We aren’t aware of any links from shortages of PPE to any of these deaths.”
New examples of the shortage of equipment seen by the Guardian include a district nurse in London being issued with just three disposable masks for a week and a care home nurse in Devon claiming her employer was limiting drinks to every four hours to avoid multiple changes of masks and gloves. The Royal College of Nursing has added to the pressure by advising nurses they should refuse to treat patients with Covid-19 “as a last resort” if they could not access the full PPE they needed. The EU procurement scheme has not been entirely successful, however. While deliveries of masks, gowns and gloves will be made in tranches over the next two to 18 weeks, the procurement of ventilators will be slow, according to a leaked EU document. “Companies indicated long delivery times, from 10 to 52 weeks,” the commission warned member states of the £690m purchase. A spokesman for the commission said: “Some of the equipment, depending on the specifications of the contracts, could be available within a few weeks after member states place orders with the industry. However, taking into account the difficult situation of the market some products require more time to be produced and delivered. “Overall, for the joint procurements launched for personal protective equipment, the commission has received offers for all categories of equipment requested, some even exceeding the amounts requested. The commission has also drawn up an initial needs assessment and will be working with member states to further detail and prioritise their necessities.” Donna Kinnair, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: “This week, ministers and officials must get a grip and stop putting nursing staff in this dire situation. Too many are phoning me to say things they needed were missing or in short supply. Nursing staff are dying from this virus and too many risks are still being run.” The Department of Health and Social Care said: “We are working round the clock with industry, the NHS, social care providers and the army to ensure the supply of PPE over the coming weeks and months and will give our NHS and the social care sector everything they need to tackle this pandemic – including working with countries around the globe. “We are also working with a number of firms to scale up production of existing UK ventilator manufacturers, as well as designing and manufacturing new products from scratch, and procuring thousands more machines from overseas. “We will continue to work with European countries and others in order to make sure that we can increase the capacity within the NHS, and we will consider participating in future EU joint procurement schemes on the basis of public health requirements at the time.”

2020-04-13T17:13:12Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer orders urgent review into leaked antisemitism report,"The new Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has ordered an immediate review into a leaked internal report into antisemitism in the party which concluded that factional hostility to his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, hampered efforts to tackle the problem. Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner, said on Monday that an independent investigation would examine the leaking of the 860-page document, details of which emerged over the weekend, as well as its contents including the “wider culture and practices” it refers to and the “background and circumstances in which the report was commissioned and the process involved”. The report uncovered many failings in the process for tackling antisemitism complaints before Jennie Formby, the current general secretary, took over in 2018. It said there was an “abundant evidence of a hyper-factional atmosphere prevailing in party HQ in this period, which appears to have affected the expeditious and resolute handling of disciplinary complaints”. It was intended to be submitted as an annex to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission inquiry into Labour’s approach to dealing with antisemitism. It is understood that it will now not be submitted. The report was completed this year in the last months of Corbyn’s leadership and its conclusions clash with complaints of whistleblowers, formerly working for Labour, who told BBC Panorama last year there had been political interference in the process from the top of the party under Corbyn. The report, seen by the Guardian, says it found no evidence of antisemitism complaints being treated differently from other forms of complaint, or of current or former staff being “motivated by antisemitic intent”. “We have also asked for immediate sight of any legal advice the Labour party has already received about the report,” Starmer and Rayner said in a statement. “In the meantime, we ask everyone concerned to refrain from drawing conclusions before the investigation is complete and we will be asking the general secretary to put measures in place to protect the welfare of party members and party staff who are concerned or affected by this report.” The previous Labour leadership’s handling of allegations of antisemitism against party members overshadowed parts of the 2019 general election campaign. During a high-profile televised interview with Andrew Neil, Corbyn repeatedly declined to apologise to the British Jewish community for the way his party had handled complaints."
2020-04-13T15:43:12Z,politics,Politics,Chequers has offered recuperation to prime ministers for 100 years,"Boris Johnson is beginning his journey of recovery at Chequers, where he is not working or receiving official papers in his red boxes, and has not had any telephone calls with the Queen. Instead, the prime minister is understood to be enjoying walking in the 600-hectare (1,500-acre) grounds of the 16th-century manor house in Buckinghamshire, wrapped up against a cool spring wind, and with his pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds, and jack russell-cross terrier, Dilyn, at his side. He is expected to remain at Chequers, the official retreat of serving prime ministers since 1921, until his medical advisers believe he is well enough to return to Downing Street. It is believed doctors from St Thomas’ hospital will keep in touch over the phone on a daily basis.
For Johnson, Chequers offers a peaceful environment in which to recuperate following 10 days of self-isolation in his flat at 11 Downing Street after testing positive for coronavirus, and a week in St Thomas’ including three nights in intensive care during which, he has said, “things could have gone either way”. Having tested negative for Covid-19 on his hospital release on Easter Sunday, hewas reunited with Symonds, who also suffered symptoms of the virus. It is not yet known how involved he will be in day-to-day decision making. A Downing Street spokesman said on Monday the prime minister had spoken to the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, who is currently deputising for Johnson, over the weekend. “The prime minister is focusing on his recovery and he is not currently carrying out government work,” the spokesman said. For the moment, it seems, Johnson is heeding the advice of medics, family, friends and cabinet colleagues and concentrating on getting well. And Chequers, set at the foot of the Chiltern Hills, and 40 miles (65km) away from the hustle and bustle of the government base in Whitehall, is the perfect place to do so, with its views of fields of cattle and sheep. To aid his recuperation, he can swim gentle lengths in the heated indoor swimming pool housed in the orangery. While in Downing Street, the prime minster was confined in his sealed-off flat with his meals left at the door between Nos 10 and 11. Chequers has its own kitchens, led by a head chef well used to providing formal dinners for a rich variety of VIPs including the Queen, world leaders such as the US president, Donald Trump, and the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, and celebrities including Sir Elton John, Bryan Adams and David Bowie. Carol Thatcher once likened Chequers to a “boutique hotel, albeit with top-level security” and the “perfect weekend retreat” in complete contrast to the Downing Street terrace. Her father, Denis, used to enjoy practising his chipping and putting on the vast lawn, while her mother, Margaret, did her prime ministerial work in the study. David Cameron once told the former French president François Hollande that it was “a good place for thinking – away from London”. Chequers was given to the nation in 1917 by Sir Arthur Lee, a Conservative minister and a director-general of food production during the first world war, and in Lloyd George became its first prime ministerial occupant in 1921. As set out in the Chequers Estate Act 1917, it was hoped to draw the sitting PM to “spend two days a week in the high and pure air of the Chiltern Hills and woods”."
2020-04-13T14:31:26Z,politics,Politics,"No 10 says UK on track for 100,000 tests a day despite current low total","Downing Street has insisted it remains on target to ensure 100,000 tests a day for coronavirus by the end of the month – despite the latest figures showing only a fifth of this number are being carried out. At the daily briefing for lobby journalists, the prime minister’s spokesman disclosed the statistics while defending the decision to allow Michael Gove’s daughter to be tested for the illness – at a time when some NHS and care home staff are still waiting to be tested themselves. The test came back negative, meaning that Gove was no longer obliged to self-isolate at home with the rest of his family. The fact that Gove was no longer self-isolating emerged when he was seen jogging in a park near his London home. On 25 March, at the last prime minister’s questions before the Easter recess , Boris Johnson told MPs that the government was “massively increasing” testing up to 25,000 per day. Later that day he told a press conference that “hopefully very soon” he wanted to reach a target of 250,000 tests a day, although when Matt Hancock, the health secretary, set a formal target to be achieved by the end of April, he settled on 100,000 tests a day.
At the Monday briefing, the PM’s spokesman said that in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Sunday, 18,000 tests were carried out in Great Britain. He said that 2,630 of those tests involved NHS staff being tested at drive-through sites, and that a total of 42,812 NHS staff and their family members had now been tested. That marked “significant progress on where we were a little over a week ago”, the spokesman claimed.
When it was put to him that the government was still a long way off the 100,000-a-day target set by Hancock, the spokesman said he did not accept that. “New capacity is coming on stream all the time,” he said, stressing that there were now 23 drive-through centres open where NHS staff could get tested. It also emerged that Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, had arranged for his daughter to be tested after she developed coronavirus symptoms. The test came back negative, meaning that Gove was no longer obliged to self-isolate at home with the rest of his family.
The spokesman said this had been done on the advice of Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, and was justified on the grounds that Gove was one of the figures leading the government’s response to coronavirus. Asked why Gove could not work from home, the spokesman said Gove chaired one of the key ministerial groups dealing with coronavirus (one covering the public sector) and it was “beneficial” for him to be able to go into the office. At the briefing it also emerged that the cabinet as a whole may not be involved in the decision, due to be formally taken this week, to extend the lockdown announced by Johnson exactly three weeks ago.
Although it normally meets on a Tuesday, no meeting has been scheduled for this week. With Johnson recovering at Chequers after his spell in intensive care, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is deputising in his absence. The spokesman said the main work coordinating the government’s response to coronavirus was being done by the morning No 10 meeting, chaired by Raab, and by the four coronavirus ministerial groups. It is seen as inevitable that the lockdown will be extended, and No 10 said the reasoning would be formally explained when the decision is formally announced, which has to be by Thursday."
2020-04-12T17:56:57Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson not back at work yet but power vacuum fears ease,"Boris Johnson is unlikely to be formally back at work for another week at the very least. But appearing on video in a suit and tie, less than two hours after leaving St Thomas’ hospital, the impression given by the prime minister was that he is keen to get back to overseeing the country’s coronavirus response as soon as possible. After spending a week on a ward, including three days in intensive care, Johnson headed straight to his country retreat at Chequers, where he will be joined by his pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, is notionally still in charge of the government’s coronavirus response, having been tasked with deputising for the prime minister at the point he entered intensive care. However, sources with knowledge of No 10 said it was very unlikely that major decisions about reviewing and lengthening the lockdown would now be taken without at least some input from the prime minister. The sense of a power vacuum in No 10 and faltering communications strategy since his admission to hospital had been very apparent to Tory MPs and more widely. But Johnson’s video message thanking the NHS for “having saved my life, no question” and optimism the UK was “making progress in this incredible national battle against coronavirus” was intended to inject some optimism after a week in which the government has come under increasing pressure. The prime minister made no mention of the criticism that has dogged the government in recent weeks over its failure to get personal protective equipment to all NHS and care staff who need it, the problems with increasing testing and the UK’s daily mortality rate having exceeded the deadliest days in Italy and Spain. But Tory MPs are privately hopeful that the prime minister’s first steps on the road to recovery will help sharpen the government’s grip on the challenges it faces in the coming weeks. The next big decision to be taken by the government, which is due by this Thursday, is how long to formally extend the current lockdown before its next review. In the longer term, Johnson is very likely to be back in the driving seat for decisions on the different options for easing the lockdown, from letting certain sectors return to business, to reopening schools, bringing in a rolling programme of restrictions on certain days or allowing younger age groups to return to society.
Concerns will, however, remain about Johnson returning to the helm too quickly. Following his admission to hospital, colleagues expressed concern Johnson had still been receiving his red box of government papers at his hospital bed and urged him to rest. No 10 has insisted it has been transparent throughout Johnson’s illness but several reports have confirmed the Guardian’s account last week that the prime minister was more ill than officials were letting on in the days before his admission to hospital. The Guardian was also told on Sunday that doctors initially told Johnson this weekend that he should stay in hospital until Tuesday before agreeing to let him recuperate at Chequers. No 10 said the prime minister had followed medical advice at all times. Johnson’s fiancee Carrie Symonds said on Twitter she “cannot thank our magnificent NHS enough”, adding: “The staff at St Thomas’ hospital have been incredible. I will never, ever be able to repay you and I will never stop thanking you.” She added: “There were times last week that were very dark indeed. My heart goes out to all those in similar situations, worried sick about their loved ones. Thank you also to everyone who sent such kind messages of support. Today I’m feeling incredibly lucky.”"
2020-04-12T17:21:02Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus live: Hancock announces contact-tracing app as UK hospital death toll passes 10,000 â€“ as it happened","Here a brief overview of the latest key developments: The toll of reported hospital deaths in the UK has passed 10,000, up from 9,875 the previous day. The daily rise of reported hospital deaths has thus slowed down, but as always, a delay in the reporting as well as delayed test results for those who have died prevent clear-cut insights into the behaviour of the curve. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, was discharged from hospital today and released a video address the nation, in which he thanked NHS staff for saving his life. The PM mentioned two immigrant nurses in particular, who had monitored him round-the-clock for 48 hours in the ICU. He said the NHS â€œis unconquerable. It is powered by love.â€� The health secretary, Matt Hancock, refused to apologise over the delay in providing NHS frontline staff with PPE, after the Royal College of Nursing said that, as a last resort, staff might have to refuse treating patients if they did not have appropriate protection. Hancock announced the development of a new contact-tracing app that would let people enter their personal health data, recent contacts and coronavirus symptoms, as the government got under increased pressure to announce plans for an exit strategy from the lockdown. The Scottish government is set to publish data on the deaths of elderly care home residents from Covid-19 after disclosing more than a third of Scotlandâ€™s care homes have had coronavirus cases. This is all from me, and this blog will now wrap up. For more updates, please head over to our global coronavirus blog. Thanks for reading and writing in, be well."
2020-04-12T16:34:34Z,politics,Politics,PM's Covid-19 timeline: from 'mild symptoms' to a brush with death,"Friday 27 March Boris Johnson announces that he has tested positive for coronavirus and is self-isolating in his Downing Street apartment. He describes mild symptoms for 24 hours including a temperature. He says that he will continue to lead the government. Saturday 28 March Secretary of state for business Alok Sharma tells reporters: “Can I be absolutely clear the PM has had mild symptoms, he is absolutely leading the response from the front.” Monday 30 March Johnson chairs cabinet by remote video link. But newspapers later report that Downing Street sources say Johnson has been “coughing and spluttering his way through conference calls”. Wednesday 1 April Johnson posts a video, urging people to stay at home and saying that those with symptoms like his should stay at home. He says that “although I am sequestered … I am able to be in constant touch with my officials” and says he is “absolutely confident” we will beat it together. Thursday 2 April When asked if the prime minister had a temperature, a Downing Street spokesman says only that he continues to have “mild symptoms”. Johnson appears on the steps of No 11 Downing Street – where his apartment is - to join the second “Clap for our Carers” event. Some observers suggest that Johnson looks unwell in pictures. Aides say he will be coming out of self-isolation on Friday. Friday 3 April Johnson is unable to leave quarantine after seven days of self-isolation because he still has a persistent temperature. He posts a video on Twitter saying that although he is feeling better “in accordance with government advice I must continue to self-isolate”. But he says that he continues to work. Lobby correspondents are told Johnson had only mild symptoms of the illness and that he chaired the morning coronavirus meeting with ministers and officials. Saturday 4 April Johnson’s pregnant partner Carrie Symonds reveals that she has had the main symptoms of coronavirus for the past week but is “on the mend”. It is reported that Johnson is “stubbornly refusing to stop working”, with the Mail on Sunday reporting a source as saying: “He has not been resting enough and is still leading from the front. Obviously that is beginning to slow down his recovery. He needs to go to bed.” Sunday 5 April Health secretary Matt Hancock tells Sky News: “He’s OK. I’ve been talking to him every day, several times a day … he’s very much got his hand on the tiller. But he’s still got a temperature … He’s working away inside Downing Street. He’s in good spirits.” But later Downing Street says that Johnson has been admitted to hospital for tests “as a precautionary step” because his symptoms are persistent 10 days after he tested positive. Monday 6 April Morning Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick tells BBC Breakfast: “We all hope and expect that he can get back to No 10 very soon.” A government spokesman says that the prime minister is in “good spirits” while continuing to work on his red box of government papers. Asked whether Johnson had pneumonia, the spokesman says that any change in his condition would be communicated to the public. But he acknowledges that the prime minister continues to have a cough and a temperature 11 days after first reporting symptoms. Afternoon A tweet from Johnson’s account says that he has gone into hospital for routine tests “as I’m still experiencing coronavirus symptoms”. It goes on: “I’m in good spirits and keeping in touch with my team, as we work together to fight this virus and keep everyone safe.” At the daily press briefing, foreign secretary Dominic Raab says that the prime minister is “still in charge” from his hospital bed. He adds: “He was admitted as a precaution only as because some of his symptoms have persisted. He is in good spirits and is still in charge of the government. “He is being given regular updates on developments and he continues to lead the government.” Raab acknowledges that he has not spoken to Johnson since Saturday. At the same briefing, chief medical officer Chris Whitty is asked if Johnson could have pneumonia. He says: “This is a question for him and his medical advisers, who are outstanding. I am absolutely not going to discuss any individual patient and I do not have the full details, nor should I.” Evening Downing Street issues a statement saying that the prime minister’s condition has “worsened” over the course of the afternoon. It continues: “On the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the hospital.”
Raab is asked to deputise for him where necessary, the statement says. It notes that Johnson is receiving “excellent care”. Tuesday 7 April Downing Street says the PM’s condition remains stable and he is in good spirits following his first night in intensive care but he would need to remain there for close monitoring. Concerns are raised about how the government will make key decisions about the pandemic in Johnson’s absence Wednesday 8 April Johnson is said to be in a stable condition and responding to treatment after a second night in intensive care. Rishi Sunak, chancellor of the exchequer, said the prime minister was sitting up in bed and engaging positively with medical staff. Thursday 9 April The prime minister is moved back on to a general hospital ward after spending three nights in intensive care. He is in extremely good spirits, Downing Street says. In response, Symonds posts a tweet a painting of a rainbow with 26 clapping emojis. At the daily briefing Raab says that he has not spoken to Johnson since he went in to hospital but insisted that the government was functioning smoothly. Friday 10 April Johnson is in good spirits and “enormously grateful for the care he’s receiving”, a number 10 spokesman says. Stanley Johnson, the PM’s father, expressed his relief in an interview on Radio 4’s Today programme. He says his son will need rest and the events may serve a wider purpose. “In a sense it’s got the whole country to realise this is a serious event. If it can hit the prime minister, for heaven’s sake, well it does come close to home.” Saturday 11 April Downing Street says Johnson continues to make very good progress. Johnson issues a short statement thanking staff at St Thomas’: “I can’t thank them enough. I owe them my life.” Sunday 12 April Johnson is discharged after seven nights in St Thomas’ and is taken to his country retreat, Chequers. Downing Street says the prime minister would be taking a break from work while he recovers. Symonds thanks staff at St Thomas’ and everyone who sent a message of support. “There were times last week that were very dark indeed. My heart goes out to all those in similar situations, worried sick about their loved ones.” In a video statement Johnson, in suit and tie, says the “NHS has saved my life, no question”. He added: “We will win because our NHS is the beating heart of this country. It is the best of this country. It is unconquerable. It is powered by love.” He paid tribute to the astonishing care he received from nurses and thanked, in particular, the “two nurses who stood by my bedside for 48 hours when things could have gone either way. They’re Jenny from New Zealand … and Luis from Portugal, near Porto. “The reason in the end my body did start to get enough oxygen was because for every second of the night they were watching and they were thinking and they were caring and making the interventions I needed.”"
2020-04-12T16:25:35Z,politics,Politics,UK app to track coronavirus spread to be launched,"The UK public will soon be able to find out if they may have been in the vicinity of people unwell with coronavirus via a new contact-tracing app, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has said. At No 10’s daily press conference on Sunday, Hancock said the NHS app would allow people to report their symptoms, and then the app would anonymously alert other app users that had been in contact with that person in recent days. The Guardian reported last week that the app, developed by NHSX – the health service’s digital transformation arm – with academic and industry partners, is in the advanced stages of evaluation and is weeks away from being ready to be deployed.
About 60% of the adult population would need to sign up and engage with the app by registering their symptoms or positive test results for it to be effective. Their proximity to other users would be logged, and they would follow advice given in alerts to self-isolate – even in cases where they were not aware of having been in contact with someone infected. Hancock told the press conference: “Today I wanted to outline the next step: a new NHS app for contact tracing. If you become unwell with the symptoms of coronavirus, you can securely tell this new NHS app and the app will then send an alert anonymously to other app users that you’ve been in significant contact with over the past few days, even before you had symptoms, so that they know and can act accordingly.” There have been concerns about privacy given the app would track people’s movements and their contacts. But Hancock said: “All data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards, and would only be used for NHS care and research, and we won’t hold it any longer than it’s needed. And as part of our commitment to transparency, we’ll be publishing the source code too. “We’re already testing this app and as we do this we’re working closely with the world’s leading tech companies and renowned experts in digital safety and ethics.” Digital contact tracing has been a central part of the containment strategy in China and other countries attempting to suppress new outbreaks of the virus. It is considered to be one of the ways that the UK could gradually leave its state of lockdown, if people are told to isolate immediately after coming into contact with those who are unwell so that they avoid potentially passing it on even if symptomless. The Equality and Human Rights Commission said it would look at the need for safeguards for people’s privacy and data. Rebecca Hilsenrath, its chief executive, said: “We support the use of technology to save lives during the pandemic. At the same time it must have the appropriate safeguards in place to protect people’s privacy and data. “The right to privacy is one of our most precious rights and it is good to hear the Health Secretary give assurances of handling this information with the highest ethical standards and for the shortest period necessary. We will be contacting the NHS to offer our advice and assistance in what they will need to consider.”"
2020-04-12T15:27:30Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson leaves hospital as he continues recovery from coronavirus,"Boris Johnson has thanked the NHS for saving his life as he left hospital to recuperate at Chequers, after a week of treatment for Covid-19. The prime minister praised two nurses in particular for watching over his bedside in intensive care for 48 hours “when things could have gone either way” – Jenny from New Zealand and Luis from Portugal. Speaking in a video message just hours after leaving St Thomas’ hospital in south London, the prime minister expressed optimism the UK was “making progress in this incredible national battle against coronavirus”. Johnson said he had left hospital “after a week in which the NHS has saved my life, no question”. He said the country was mourning “every day those who are taken from us in such numbers, and the struggle is by no means over” but he argued progress was being made “because the British public formed a human shield around this country’s greatest national asset – our NHS”. Johnson said he had seen the pressures the NHS was under after seven days in hospital, including three in intensive care. And he had witnessed the “personal courage not just of the doctors and nurses but of everyone: the cleaners, the cooks, the healthcare workers of every description, physios, radiographers, pharmacists”.
He praised a list of nurses and doctors who had looked after him by name, and gave extra thanks to Jenny and Luis, saying their care and interventions were “the reason in the end my body did start to get enough oxygen”. “That is how I also know that across this country, 24 hours a day, for every second of every hour, there are hundreds of thousands of NHS staff who are acting with the same care and thought and precision as Jenny and Luis,” he said. “That is why we will defeat this coronavirus and defeat it together. We will win because our NHS is the beating heart of this country. It is the best of this country. It is unconquerable. It is powered by love.” He also praised and thanked the public for observing social distancing when “the whole natural world seems at its loveliest and the outdoors is so inviting”. However, he made no mention of the criticism that has dogged the government in recent weeks over its failure to get personal protective equipment to all NHS and care staff who need it, the problems with increasing testing and the UK’s daily mortality rate having exceeded the deadliest days in Italy and Spain. No 10 said the prime minister will head to Chequers to continue his recovery, leaving Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, deputising for him. A No 10 spokesman said: “The PM has been discharged from hospital to continue his recovery at Chequers. On the advice of his medical team, the PM will not be immediately returning to work. He wishes to thank everybody at St Thomas’ for the brilliant care he has received. All of his thoughts are with those affected by this illness.” Raab has already announced the UK’s lockdown will continue beyond the initial three-week period set out by Johnson and may have to take further decisions in the coming days about how much longer it should stay in place. Johnson was taken into hospital last Sunday after his coronavirus symptoms, including a cough and a high temperature, persisted. He was moved into intensive care on Monday evening. The government said he was not put on a ventilator but had continued to receive “standard oxygen treatment”.
On Thursday, he was moved back to a hospital ward after three nights in intensive care, and was said to be in “extremely good spirits”, according to Downing Street. Following his admission, colleagues expressed concern Johnson had still been receiving his red box of government papers at his hospital bed and urged him to rest. No 10 has insisted it has been transparent throughout Johnson’s illness but several reports have confirmed that the prime minister was more ill than officials were letting on in the days before his admission to hospital. Johnson is expected to take some time to recuperate, rather than returning swiftly to Downing Street, but is likely to want to be involved in the decision about when and how to end the lockdown. In a statement, Johnson’s fiancee Carrie Symonds said she “cannot thank our magnificent NHS enough”: “The staff at St Thomas’ hospital have been incredible. I will never, ever be able to repay you and I will never stop thanking you.” She added: “There were times last week that were very dark indeed. My heart goes out to all those in similar situations, worried sick about their loved ones. Thank you also to everyone who sent such kind messages of support. Today I’m feeling incredibly lucky.”"
2020-04-12T15:23:20Z,politics,Politics,"'Hostility to Corbyn' curbed Labour efforts to tackle antisemitism, says leaked report","A leaked internal report into Labour’s handling of antisemitism concludes that factional hostility to Jeremy Corbyn hampered the party’s efforts to tackle the problem. The report does not name an author but was completed in the last months of Corbyn’s leadership. It was intended to be submitted as an annexe to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) inquiry into Labour’s approach to dealing with antisemitism. However, it is understood it will not be sent, following an intervention by the party’s lawyers. The report’s conclusions clash with complaints of whistleblowers, formerly working for Labour, who told BBC Panorama last year there had been political interference in the process from the top of the party under Corbyn. Their claims were strongly denied by Labour at the time, which accused the BBC of bias and called for the documentary to be pulled. The new internal report, seen by the Guardian, said it had found no evidence of antisemitism complaints being treated differently to other forms of complaint, or of current or former staff being “motivated by antisemitic intent”. But the 860-page document said it uncovered many failings in the process for tackling antisemitism complaints before Jennie Formby, the current general secretary, took over in 2018. The report said there was an “abundant evidence of a hyper-factional atmosphere prevailing in party HQ in this period, which appears to have affected the expeditious and resolute handling of disciplinary complaints”. The report said it might not seem immediately clear why this is relevant but “many staff, including GLU [governance and legal unit] staff and senior staff with responsibility for managing and overseeing GLU, were bitterly opposed to the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, and seem to have been demotivated, or largely interested in work that could advance a factional agenda”. It said: “At its extreme, some employees seem to have taken a view that the worse things got for Labour the happier they would be, since this might expedite Jeremy Corbyn’s departure from office. Further, there is little evidence of strong management of procedures, workloads and priorities in HQ, which also impacted GLU’s work.” The report contains several leaked WhatsApp messages that show many senior officials were hostile to Corbyn when he took over. It shows references to Corbyn-supporting party staff as “trots”, conversations referring to former director of communications Seumas Milne as “dracula”, and that he was “spiteful and evil and we should make sure he is never allowed in our party if it’s last thing we do”. There were also mentions of Corbyn’s former chief of staff Karie Murphy as “medusa”, a “crazy woman” and a “bitch face cow” that would “make a good dartboard”. A Labour party spokesperson told Sky News, which first leaked the document: “The party has submitted extensive information to the EHRC and responded to questions and requests for further information, none of which included this document.” Charlotte Nichols, Labour MP for Warrington North, said the report should be published in full. “Jewish members have a right to know what has happened and to see the evidence,” she said. But Ian Austin, the former Labour MP who left the party over antisemitism and later called on people to back Boris Johnson, said the report was unreliable. He tweeted: “In last days of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, Labour trawled through 10,000 emails and messages to produce a report into antisemitism that attempts to shield him and his supporters from any blame, and instead pin responsibility on whistleblowers and former members of staff. Eight whistleblowers told the BBC’s Panorama last year how they felt undermined by senior Labour bosses in their attempts to tackle antisemitism. They alleged that there was consistent interference in complaints and one key aide mocked their efforts. Labour strongly denied the allegations of political interference and came out on the offensive, as it accused the BBC of bias and called for the documentary to be pulled. Since taking over as leader, Keir Starmer told Jewish leaders he had asked for all outstanding investigations into antisemitism within the party to be “on my desk at the end of the week”. After a video meeting, he said: “It was very important to me to seek to address the disgrace of antisemitism in our party as soon as possible. Today, I repeated once again the apology I made as soon as I was elected leader. Over the last few years, we have failed the Jewish community on antisemitism.”"
2020-04-12T06:10:35Z,politics,Politics,How long can Dominic Raab govern as a stand-in prime minister?,"Last week exposed a gap in the UK’s constitutional arrangements. The prime minister fell victim to the virus his government was battling. After a week of assurances that he was able to govern as normal from a sealed flat in Downing Street, Boris Johnson was admitted first to hospital, then to intensive care. Before Johnson went to St Thomas’ hospital, he had the foresight to pass the baton to the first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, who would combine some prime ministerial responsibilities with those of his day job of foreign secretary. Raab’s primary duty would be to chair meetings of the cabinet and cabinet committees. That, in fact, is much of what occupies prime ministerial time, especially when there are daily crisis meetings. Raab said that he was acting under clear instructions from the prime minister. We were assured that there was no lacuna in our national security arrangements – Raab could, if necessary, declare war. Fortunately that capability was not tested last week. But he did not have the full range of prime ministerial powers. He could not hire and fire his colleagues – and would not be meeting the Queen for a weekly audience.
For a week, these arrangements have worked. The tramlines of the government’s Covid-19 strategy were clear: ramping up testing, reinforcing NHS critical-care capacity, making sure that the cheques promised by the chancellor to support workers and business were delivered. Raab could front press conferences. Last weekend’s papers were full of unedifying mudslinging and scapegoating: one immediate consequence of the PM’s hospital admission seems to have been to make the cabinet realise it needed to show it could act collectively, without a PM to impose discipline. The question is whether this ad hoc arrangement can work for longer than a week. Raab’s authority was always going to be tested when important choices had to be made: how to start the exit from lockdown; how to balance maximum suppression with the wider health and social implications of stringent restriction; and the need to support economic bounce-back. Down the line, a decision will have to be made on whether to agree an extension to the Brexit transition before the end of June. Skilful chairmanship might be able to fashion a consensus. But sometimes prime ministers just have to decide. That is where Raab might have struggled. In his cabinet, Johnson is the unique big beast. Raab was knocked out early in the leadership contest. He was not the architect of the election victory; cabinet members do not owe him their jobs. Under Theresa May we saw how hard it was for a prime minister to get her way when she had no political authority. Raab’s task will be much easier if, on the big calls, a convalescent prime minister can give his cabinet a steer. That will lend Raab valuable authority. If Johnson can’t do that, Raab’s task will be much harder. So we, like the prime minister, may have got lucky. We may never find out whether our ad hoc arrangements are robust enough to withstand the long-term incapacitation of a prime minister during a crisis. Strengthening them should be a post-crisis priority. Jill Rutter is senior research fellow at thinktank UK in a Changing Europe"
2020-04-12T06:05:35Z,politics,Politics,A Tudor court without a king: inside No 10 as Raab takes the reins,"Collegiate cooperation has been ostentatiously on display this week since Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital. Yet for all the businesslike collaboration in Whitehall, there is no denying a nervousness also lurks.
“We’re in a holding pattern at the moment,” said one insider. “We can get away with it for the time being. But it comes down to how long the PM is going to be out of action – and when the decision about the next phase [of the Covid-19 response] is going to come down the track.” That nervousness is fuelled not just by Johnson’s absence. It has been aggravated by a crunch of gears, as Downing Street, initially determined to centralise power, has been forced to delegate responsibility at a time of national crisis. And with every passing hour, the elastic connecting Johnson with the actions of his ministers is being stretched. According to officials, the weeks ahead will be about tweaking the dials of the response to the crisis – dozens of individual decisions that will ultimately dictate everyday life in Britain. And some of those decisions are already looming. In the short term at least, several sources said the machinery of government is working well enough. Even critics of Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary leading the cabinet in Johnson’s absence, have commended his performance. At the daily 9.15am meeting, now largely a video conference with cabinet ministers hosted from the cabinet room, Raab has reassured the doubters by asking the right questions. As one put it: “The power has not gone to his head.” In fact, Raab’s approach, according to several allies, is simply to best execute the instructions he knows Johnson has given to the cabinet. Meanwhile, the creation weeks ago of cabinet response sub-committees means that work streams were already in place, with the de facto “coronavirus quad” of Raab, chancellor Rishi Sunak, health secretary Matt Hancock and cabinet office minister Michael Gove all looking after their own briefs. It also ensured Raab was involved from early on. Even on the most difficult issues, such as testing, personal protective equipment and financial aid, each minister knows the target they have been set. Clashes so far have been relatively minor, including complaints about the quality of the data flowing from the NHS. “I have not felt like I’ve been in a vacuum in the last week,” says one person heavily involved. “We’ve still had clear steers.” Even with decisions such as whether the length of lockdown should be primarily to protect the economy or to protect lives , the Whitehall reality is currently not so stark. One of the most concerned about the overall health implications of a prolonged lockdown has been Hancock. Treasury officials are also concerned about the damage that a second spike could do if social distancing rules are relaxed too soon. Yet while the governing process has managed to withstand a week without the prime minister, no one doubts this has been the easy part. Trouble lies ahead, as many decisions on the functioning of Britain’s pandemic response speed towards government. Ahead is a period that gives the lie to the idea that the Covid-19 response is dictated by “the science”, as ministers have been keen to state. Work is under way to examine which lockdown measures are having most and least impact, requiring decisions on what could be dialled up and down. Similar academic studies are looking at the impact on mental health. The effects on health are being examined by both health and Treasury officials. The extent to which people are not using the NHS for serious non-coronavirus issues is also causing concern, requiring decisions on new public communications. Elsewhere, private industry is pressing to fill the gaps in Britain’s ability to make a vaccine should one become available. That could require the government taking big financial risks to build factories that may ultimately be redundant. All these issues, and many more, will require political decisions that will comprise the government’s strategy for the next phase of its coronavirus response. With the peak of the virus expected soon, each day that Johnson is out of action will be crucial. It is an irony not lost on officials that this uncertainty is happening under a No 10 regime initially determined to consolidate power. “We still have cabinet government, but what’s missing is the political authority of the prime minister,” said Catherine Haddon, senior fellow at the Institute for Government. “It is worth remembering that only a few months ago, Sajid Javid resigned as chancellor because No 10 and the prime minister seemed to want greater control over the Treasury. So we have a prime minister who was building up his own political power – in order to do the job he felt needed to be done.” On top of that, officials say a system similar to a Tudor court had emerged in Downing Street. Advisers could argue their case, but only certain figures had Johnson’s ear. However, Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s controversial senior adviser, has been self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms, and trusted aides Ben Gascoigne and Eddie Lister have also been absent from No 10. According to some, it has focused minds on the question of who is in charge. Suddenly, the apparent strength acquired by No 10 is at risk of becoming a weakness, should the prime minister be absent for weeks to come. As a result, could this experience curb some of the more iconoclastic plans dreamed up by Johnson’s team, such as taking on the civil service? “I think having that institutional expertise, memory and strength now has come in pretty handy,” said one internal critic of those plans. “There is no energy, bandwidth or money for arbitrary institutional changes. All efforts will have to go into getting the economy on its feet again. Many of the battles that were fought now seem pointless.”"
2020-04-10T16:05:55Z,politics,Politics,"Labour will keep you safe, says new shadow home secretary","Labour must be a party of responsibility that backs frontline police officers and promises to keep the public safe from crime, the new shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, says. In an interview with the Guardian, the Welsh MP, promoted to the shadow cabinet in Keir Starmer’s comprehensive reshuffle last weekend, said crime was a “progressive issue”, and lavished praise on the police for enforcing the coronavirus lockdown. “Labour have a message that we will keep you, your family and your community safe. That’s very much the approach that I come from,” he said. “I grew up in the constituency I represent, in the eastern valley of the South Wales coalfields, in an era when jobs and opportunities were being taken away by the Thatcher government. And it really did strike me then, that crime was an issue that progressives had to be serious about.” “Responsibility is the word that I would use,” he said. “Responsibility to others, to society: there is such a thing as society, there’s no doubt about that. Crimes have victims; they damage the fabric of that society. But there is a responsibility for government as well, and it’s the responsibility to keep people safe.” He was at pains to praise the police officers given the task of enforcing the coronavirus lockdown, despite widely cited instances of over-zealousness. “I’ve obviously seen those various incidents that have happened. But I just think it’s unfair when I as a politician have handed over this enormous set of powers, to then start picking on particular officers and particular forces. “What I’m trying to do is to recognise the difficult situation, and the latitude we do need to give to our officers,” he said. “By and large, I think the police are getting it right.” With some of the best-known figures in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet relegated to the backbenches, either voluntarily or at Starmer’s hand, Thomas-Symonds and his new shadow cabinet colleagues will be intently scrutinised for clues to Labour’s direction. Like the party’s new leader, he strikes a resolutely constructive tone regarding the government’s handling of the virus. “In a public health emergency, a national crisis like this – it’s difficult to think of anything comparable since 1945, frankly – my view is that we have to support the government in the aim of minimising loss of life through the crisis. That’s absolutely in the national interest, and absolutely what we aim to do. But we have to balance it with scrutiny,” he said. But Thomas-Symonds said he hoped the crucial frontline role played by NHS workers and others in the crisis, and the weekly nationwide round of applause, would help to change attitudes to migration. The government’s new points-based system, due to come into force next year, is expected to set a salary threshold of £25,600 – or more in some sectors – with the aim of halting low-skilled migration. “One thing I really hope this crisis has taught the Conservatives, is that the value of what people do is not always reflected in the salary that they’re paid,” Thomas-Symonds said. “We hear a lot of warm words about our police, the ambulance services, the fire services, our NHS workers, our care workers. But take nurses: when you look at the salary threshold that’s being proposed, nurses, especially when they’re starting off, are below it, and I think the government has to seriously look at how we value people in our society.”
He declined to be drawn on what migration system Labour would like to see, saying it would be “fairer”, and that developing it in detail would be an important focus for the party over the next two to three years. “In terms of migration and broad principles, Labour’s an internationalist party. Labour will always believe in the right to live and to work in other countries. Of course we will; also in terms of fairness, and a recognition that the immigration system is about people. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about statistics, it’s about people,” he said, describing the Windrush scandal as a “shameful” episode. While little known outside Westminster, the 39-year-old has written two biographies of Labour’s great figures – Aneurin Bevan and Clement Attlee – and practised as a barrister until becoming an MP in 2015. Before training as a lawyer, he taught politics at Oxford University. “I’ve studied the history of the home secretaries, and my impression is that the really successful home secretaries are strategic,” he said. “They have a really strong sense of what their priorities are, and they give a very strong sense of direction, and when that disappears, I think that’s when you start to get into trouble.” He is surprised his Tory opposite number, Priti Patel, has not played a more prominent role during the crisis. Major decisions are being overseen by a “quad” of senior ministers, chaired in the prime minister’s absence by the first secretary, Dominic Raab, and including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the cabinet office minister, Michael Gove. Asked about Patel’s absence from the inner circle, Thomas-Symonds says: “I do think the home secretary should be out on the media regularly, showing her support for our police officers. We want to say them very clearly as politicians, we back what you’re doing and we understand the difficulties.”"
2020-04-10T15:11:23Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson waved thanks to NHS staff as he left intensive care,"Boris Johnson waved his thanks to medical staff as he was moved from the intensive care unit back to the ward, a Downing Street spokesman has said, as the prime minister began his recovery from Covid-19. The prime minister, who was moved out of intensive care on Thursday evening, was said to be in good spirits on Friday, according to a No 10 spokesman. Johnson was “enormously grateful for the care he’s receiving,” the official added, saying “he was waving his thanks towards the nurses and doctors that he saw as he was being moved from the intensive care unit back to the ward”. A No 10 spokesman added later on Friday: “The prime minister has been able to do short walks, between periods of rest, as part of the care he is receiving to aid his recovery. “He has spoken to his doctors and thanks the whole clinical team for the incredible care he has received. His thoughts are with those affected by this terrible disease.” Matt Hancock, the health secretary, told the daily briefing that Johnson’s condition continued to improve. “He wants to personally thank the whole clinical team at St Thomas’ for the incredible care he has received,” Hancock said. The updates came after the prime minister’s father, Stanley, spoke of the improvement in his son’s condition, saying he was “amazingly thankful” for the efforts of the NHS and appreciative of the nation’s outpouring of support. But he insisted his son – who is still being treated at St Thomas’ hospital in London – must rest, warning that he cannot get “straight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins”. He added: “To use that American expression, he almost took one for the team. We have got to make sure we play the game properly now.”
There will be just one daily update about Johnson’s condition now he is out of intensive care, the spokesman said. Asked what contact Johnson had had with No 10, he added: “The PM is just beginning his recovery and he will be taking advice from his medical team.” On Thursday evening, Downing Street said Johnson, 55, had been moved from intensive care back to the ward “where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery”. He was taken into hospital on Sunday after his coronavirus symptoms, including a cough and high temperature, persisted and he was moved to intensive care on Monday evening.
The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who has been deputising for the prime minister, earlier said Johnson was making “positive steps forward”. Johnson’s pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds – who has also had a bout of suspected Covid-19 – responded to the news by posting a rainbow on Twitter and a series of clapping emojis to show support for the NHS. On Friday morning Johnson’s 79-year-old father also issued thanks. “Relief is the right word,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, adding: “I feel tremendously grateful obviously on behalf of the family, Boris’s family, my family, family members all over the place, and also, of course, amazingly thankful as well. Thankful for the tremendous outpouring of which we have seen.”
But he warned his son must rest. “This is pretty straightforward now. He must rest up. As I understand it ... he has moved from the ICU into a recovery unit but I don’t think you can say this is out of the woods now,” he said. “He has to take time. I cannot believe you can walk away from this and get straight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins without a period of readjustment.” He also explained his son’s illness had highlighted the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic. “I do think about this whole event of Boris going into intensive care, and now ... coming out, it has actually served an amazing purpose,” he said. “In a sense it’s got the whole country to realise this is a serious event. If it can hit the prime minister, for heaven’s sake, well it does come close to home.”"
2020-04-10T12:45:21Z,politics,Politics,Robert Jenrick urged to explain visit to parents during lockdown,"The shadow home secretary has demanded that the cabinet minister Robert Jenrick fully explain himself after travelling more than an hour to visit his parents at the weekend – despite warning others to stay at home during the coronavirus lockdown. The Guardian revealed that the housing, communities and local government secretary – who has made media appearances urging people to save lives by remaining in their properties even if they are tempted to see loved ones – went to see his parents at their Shropshire home, 40 miles by road from his own. It also emerged that Jenrick travelled 150 miles from his London property, where he stayed at the start of the lockdown, to his £1.2m Herefordshire home from where he travelled to his parents. His website says he lives with his family near Newark, his constituency in Nottingham, and London. The revelations also prompted a former Tory minister to accuse Jenrick of “arrogance”. But Jenrick defended his actions, saying he went to deliver food and medicine to his isolating parents. However, the Guardian understands his parents – who are aged 69 and 79 – were already receiving help from the local community, raising questions over the necessity of his trip.
Asked whether he thought Jenrick was ignoring the government’s stay-at-home advice, Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think that’s for him to explain. As you know, the delivery of essential supplies like food and medicine to vulnerable people, vulnerable family members, would be permissible in the exceptions that there are for people to go outside. “But I think it’s very important now for public confidence that Robert Jenrick fully explains himself and why exactly that journey was necessary.” Downing Street defended Jenrick with a spokesman insisting the minister had complied with social distancing guidelines. Government instructions say: “You should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home.” The only exception is if they need help, such as having shopping or medication dropped off. The former Tory minister Anna Soubry, who left the party in opposition to its stance on Brexit, tweeted on Friday morning: “The selfish arrogance of 2 trips #RobertJenrick telling cramped families in inner city high rises or squeezed suburban homes to #StayAtHome is bad enough but justifying it by asserting he didn’t break the rules is shameful. Snr Ministers must practise what they preach.” She added: “#RobertJenrick didn’t break #COVID-19 rules but he totally ignored his own instruction to #StayHome which he repeatedly said in media interviews & from the No 10 podium. It smacks of arrogance. For some time many of us have said Govt messaging must be clear, consistent & honest.” Steve Reed, Labour’s new communities spokesman, earlier told the Daily Mail: “MPs need to set an example to everyone about the importance of not moving around the country and if Robert Jenrick can’t provide a very good explanation as to why these trips were necessary then he needs to consider his position.” The row over Jenrick’s movements broke out after Scotland’s chief medical officer last week quit her post following intense criticism after she twice visited her second home. And it came amid ongoing questions over the whereabouts of Dominic Cummings, whose location Downing Street has repeatedly refused to clarify when asked this week.
After the Guardian’s story on Jenrick was published, the minister tweeted: “For clarity – my parents asked me to deliver some essentials – including medicines. They are both self-isolating due to age and my father’s medical condition and I respected social distancing rules.” Defending moving to his Herefordshire property, he told the Mail that his family considered it the family home. Nearly three weeks ago the government published guidance warning people against all but essential travel, highlighting this “does not include visits to second homes” and that “people must remain in their primary residence”. Jenrick’s actions were defended by others, with Prof Paul Cosford, the emeritus medical director of Public Health England (PHE), suggesting it sounded like Jenrick had remained within the four “clear” guidelines by travelling 40 miles to deliver medicine and other essential items. “I can’t comment on Mr Jenrick. It sounds as if what he did was within one of the four guidelines to me, but others will obviously have to think about that more,” he said. Speaking at the daily No 10 lobby briefing, the prime minister’s spokesman said: “The secretary of state has set out in two different statements the reasons for the journeys that he made. “We are confident that he complied with the social distancing rules.”"
2020-04-10T12:34:01Z,politics,Politics,Tracy Brabin's phone number accidentally displayed on ITV's This Morning,"Tracy Brabin has said she will have to change her phone number after it was inadvertently shown on screen during an appearance on ITV’s This Morning. The Labour MP for Batley and Spen, who is a former Coronation Street actor, appeared on the show to discuss funding being made available for MPs to cover the costs of closing their constituency offices. As she appeared via FaceTime, her phone number appeared across the top of the screen. The interview was then repeatedly interrupted as she started to receive calls to her mobile. “I’m so sorry, I’m getting calls at the moment,” she said. “That is why it’s dropping. Oh, there’s another one.” Brabin later wrote on Twitter: “Just done This Morning and my phone number was posted on screen and I’ve been inundated so will have to change my number. Please TEXT.”
One viewer tweeted: “Her signal isn’t bad, instead, her number was leaked live on TV and everyone is trying to call her.” Another wrote: “You can’t stop receiving calls during your FaceTime to This Morning because your phone number was broadcast so people rang it.” Brabin, the former shadow culture secretary, appeared on the show to speak about the £10,000 that is to be made available to MPs to cover their extra office costs incurred during the coronavirus pandemic. The money comes in addition to the £26,000 MPs can claim to cover office costs and is designed to be used by MPs and their staff to buy equipment – such as laptops and printers – so they can work from home. The host Eamonn Holmes told Brabin: “You might need it [the extra money] for a new computer or wifi there because your signal is dropping out.”
He later apologised for the error. “There is something I want to refer to, a quick word about an item in the programme at the start of the programme today,” he said. “It was an interview with the Labour MP Tracy Brabin, and some of you will have noticed a technical error during that transmission and we want to say sincere regret and we are very sorry to Tracy for any stress or trouble that that may have caused.” A spokeswoman for This Morning said: “It was a technical error, which was swiftly rectified.”"

2020-04-09T19:31:33Z,politics,Politics,A woman's place appears to be anywhere but the Downing Street press briefing | John Crace,"Coronavirus is man’s work. At least, that appears to be the government’s assessment of it, for in the three weeks of daily Downing Street press briefings, not once has a woman minister been allowed out to be front-of-house compere. Priti Patel, Liz Truss and Thérèse Coffey have become all but invisible. Missing in action. They might as well not exist. For the third time this week it was Dominic Raab – the de facto prime minister while Boris Johnson is in intensive care – who did the business for the government. And, to be fair, he’s getting visibly better at it. He looks less unstable and more the man who can easily see out 24 hours of close police interrogation over unsolved missing persons cases. Though he might have struggled if anyone had questioned him about the disappearance of the home secretary. It also helped that the foreign secretary didn’t have any news, other than the grim daily death statistics, to impart. So he could stick to doing what he knows best, which is spilling out a random series of words, only some of which amount to fully coherent sentences. At some point in his career, the black-belt martial arts specialist is going to have to realise that the brain is also a muscle. Coming up with lines like “We are focusing on the things we need to focus on” may sound impressive at cabinet meetings, but doesn’t translate well to those of us who speak human. Still, after Raab had spent the best part of five minutes telling everyone to stay at home for Easter – the No 10 lectern had been helpfully updated with this new logo – it did become clear why Patel might have dodged a bullet by being excluded from this briefing. Because Raab went on to deliver a long thank-you to all the NHS staff, care workers, hospital cleaners, delivery drivers and supermarket staff who were keeping people alive and the country running: the very people who would never have been let into the country if the home secretary had been allowed to implement her points-based immigration system a few years earlier. For Priti, ideology is all. She didn’t vote to take back control to have an immigrant clean a hospital floor or operate a supermarket checkout. “We now know who the key workers really are,” said Raab. Indeed we did. And to the surprise of many Tory MPs, they weren’t the hedge-fund managers or party donors they had imagined. Here Raab’s legendary ability to dissociate came in handy. Because back in 2010, he, Patel and several other leading Tories wrote a book, Britannia Unchained, in which they advocated increased austerity, doubling down on laissez-faire economics and branded the Brits as some of the idlest people in the world. But some things don’t change. Asked if the government might care to show its gratitude to the key workers with a cash bonus once the pandemic was over, Raab became evasive. Money, what money? Wasn’t it enough for these workers to have saved the country before being asked to leave? At times like these, Dom could almost be a double for David Brent. “The bad news is that some of you will lose your jobs. On a more positive note, the good news is that I’ve been promoted – so every cloud, eh?” Not that Raab seemed overly keen to emphasise the extent of his new powers as de facto prime minister. If anything, he tried to downplay them, suggesting that all cabinet decisions were now more like tantric meditation sessions. Unfortunately, the answers provided by that process can be less than crystal clear. Raab was as evasive on what the government strategy for determining the timing of the end of the partial lockdown might be – journalists have long since given up asking for an actual date – as he was on why the government had had to increase its overdraft with the Bank of England. Where was Rishi when you needed him?
The biggest unanswered question, though, was the one that has been left hanging over every press conference. Why is Germany handling the crisis so much better than us? Some projections suggest the German death rate from the coronavirus will be about 10% of ours. What’s their secret? Raab, Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance all just shrugged their shoulders. They had no idea. Or none fit for public consumption. You could almost sense the desperation in Dom’s voice as he pleaded one last time for calm over Easter. Being in charge isn’t nearly so much fun as he had imagined. He’s missing Boris badly. Weirdly, I am too. At least with Boris you get some kind of hopeful bollocks. With Raab you just get bollocks. In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king."
2020-04-09T19:28:08Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson moved from intensive care but stays in hospital,"Boris Johnson is back on a hospital ward after spending three nights in intensive care, and is in â€œextremely good spiritsâ€�, Downing Street has announced. In a statement released on Thursday evening, a No 10 spokesman said: â€œThe prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery.â€�
Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Johnson, had earlier said the prime minister was making â€œpositive steps forwardâ€�. Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Raab admitted he had not spoken to Johnson since the prime minister was admitted to hospital, but insisted the government continued to function smoothly. Johnson had previously been described as sitting up, but he had not been playing any role in government decision-making while he received treatment at St Thomasâ€™ hospital in London. Asked if he had been in contact with the prime minister, Raab said: â€œNot yet. I think itâ€™s important, particularly while heâ€™s in intensive care, to let him focus on the recovery. We in the government have this covered. â€œI chaired the Cobra meeting that Iâ€™ve just come from. Weâ€™re pursuing all the different strands of our strategy to defeat the coronavirus, and Iâ€™m confident weâ€™ll get there.â€� Raab has also been chairing the daily Covid-19 committee meetings of the cabinet, which are attended by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the cabinet office minister, Michael Gove. Hancock welcomed the news that the prime minister had left intensive care, saying: â€œI know our amazing NHS staff have given him their characteristic world-class care.â€� On Thursday evening, just after the 8pm â€œClap for Carersâ€� where people across the country came out to applaud healthcare and key workers, the prime ministerâ€™s fiancee, Carrie Symonds, showed her appreciation for the NHS by tweeting a picture of a rainbow and a series of clapping emojis.
The rainbow has become a symbol during the coronavirus pandemic for people wanting to show solidarity with NHS workers. Johnson was taken into hospital on Sunday after his coronavirus symptoms, including a cough and a high temperature, persisted. He was moved into intensive care on Monday evening. The government has said he has not been put on a ventilator but has continued to receive â€œstandard oxygen treatmentâ€�. Johnson tested positive for the virus on 27 March, but continued to work while isolating himself in Downing Street, including chairing meetings by videolink. The home secretary, Priti Patel, told Talk Radio on Thursday that at the virtual cabinet meeting a week ago, pictures of which were released to the media, it was evident to colleagues he was continuing to experience symptoms. â€œIt was clear he was unwell, and needed to get rest and recuperation,â€� she said. Johnson tested positive on the same day as Hancock and the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, also announced he was experiencing symptoms. Johnsonâ€™s close aide Dominic Cummings also reported experiencing symptoms of the virus. Raab said earlier in the week: â€œIâ€™m confident [Johnson] will pull through because if there is one thing that I know about this prime minister, he is a fighter and he will be back leading us through this crisis in short order.â€� Symonds, who is expecting a child in the summer, also went into self-isolation after experiencing symptoms of the virus â€“ though she has said she has now recovered. The Queen sent a message to Symonds and Johnsonâ€™s family earlier in the week, wishing the prime minister a speedy recovery."
2020-04-09T19:24:43Z,politics,Politics,House of Lords to conduct some duties online when parliament reopens,"Some of the key functions of the House of Lords will be conducted virtually when parliament returns later this month, as UK democracy seeks a new way to function through the coronavirus crisis, according to a letter sent to peers on Thursday. It means, among other things, that members of the House will be able to use video conferencing to dial in remotely to parliamentary proceedings. The Lords authorities also plan to re-examine how much members receive in allowances given that they will not be expected to travel to attend the Palace of Westminster. Signed by Lord Speaker Fowler as well as the upper chamber’s political leaders, the letter said they had agreed that oral statements and oral questions should be conducted online from 21 April. They said they plan to ensure that general debates and certain stages of legislation will also be held virtually at some point in the future.
The letter, signed by Fowler, Labour’s leader of the opposition Baroness Smith, the leader of the Liberal Democrats’ in the Lords Lord Newby and the Conservatives’ leader of the house Baroness Evans, said that initially, participation in virtual proceeds would be limited, with a view to expansion in the future. “The leaders, convenor and Lord Speaker have agreed that as a priority oral questions and oral statements should be, as much as possible, held virtually. A number of committees have been doing some of their work remotely over this period and that will continue once the house returns. “For fully virtual sessions, there may need to be a limit on the number being held each day to ensure Parliamentary Digital Service (PDS) resources are available, but work on this continues. “We are also working towards a position in which other types of business – general debates, certain stages of legislation – can be undertaken virtually, but we are going to have to make progress on a step-by-step basis,” the letter said. Mindful that some of the chamber’s older members may struggle with technology – their average age is 70, according to data from 2019 - the letter urges peers to acquaint themselves with Microsoft Teams so that they can participate. “We would strongly encourage all members to use the period before the house meets to familiarise themselves with the platform as this will be the means by which members can participate in any virtual proceedings,” it said. The body overseeing the House of Lords will also re-examine how much peers receive in allowances under the new system, according to the letter. At present, they can opt to receive an allowance of £313 per day, plus travel expenses and subsidised restaurant facilities.
“In view of the fact we intend a significant amount of business to be able to take place virtually, after Easter the House of Lords commission will look at how the allowances system can be adapted to reflect this new, temporary way of working,” it said. One option could be for peers to be allowed to claim a half-rate, which is currently allowed for work away from Westminster. Parliament closed early for Easter as members in the Palace of Westminster sought to abide by social distancing measures to slow the spread of Covid-19. Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the House of Commons, announced last week that the government and parliament hoped that appropriate technology would be in place by 21 April, when MPs also return. It followed demands for a virtual lower chamber from the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, and opposition parties."
2020-04-09T18:55:18Z,politics,Politics,Angela Rayner to stand in for Keir Starmer at PMQs,"Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, will stand in for Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons opposite Dominic Raab, the party announced on Thursday, as the new leader completed his reshuffle. Starmer announced his shadow cabinet earlier this week. With junior roles now also filled, he has brought more than a dozen Labour MPs who sat out the Jeremy Corbyn era or resigned in 2016 back onto the party’s frontbench. They include the former leadership candidate Jess Phillips, who will be a shadow home office minister covering domestic violence and safeguarding.
Liz Kendall, who made a centrist pitch for the leadership in 2015 but lost out to Corbyn, will be shadow social care minister, and Alison McGovern, the chair of the Labour campaign group Progress and a keen footballer, will be shadow sports minister. There are also jobs for many young Labour leftwingers, including Alex Sobel and Lloyd Russell-Moyle, who will cover tourism and the natural environment respectively. Starmer’s campaign chief, Jenny Chapman, a former MP who lost her Darlington seat in December, tweeted: “This is what unity looks like.” The shadow Treasury team in particular appears to span the breadth of the party. The Liverpool Walton MP, Dan Carden, a former aide to Len McCluskey who was Corbyn’s shadow development secretary, is shadow financial secretary. He will serve alongside Wes Streeting, the Ilford North MP who was a vociferous critic of Corbyn’s leadership, and Pat McFadden, whom Corbyn sacked as Europe minister in 2016.
Some of the most vociferous champions of a second Brexit referendum, including the Cardiff South MP, Stephen Doughty, have also been given frontbench roles. Doughty, who previously worked for Oxfam, will be shadow Africa minister. Rayner had already been named as Labour chair, but Starmer’s announcement that she would deputise for him at PMQs and in other key functions will ensure she has a prominent public role. Rayner had been widely seen as a potential leadership candidate after Corbyn promised to step down following the party’s general election defeat, but she stepped aside in favour of her close friend Rebecca Long-Bailey. She is a robust parliamentary performer. She was also more blunt in criticising Boris Johnson during the general election campaign than Corbyn, who stuck to his mantra of “they go low, we go high”. Rayner, who was a single mother at the age of 16, called scathing remarks by Johnson about the children of single mothers, which were unearthed during the campaign, disgusting. Starmer has signalled his willingness to take a constructive approach to working with the government to tackle the coronavirus crisis, but allies insist it is a fantasy that Labour could join a government of national unity as some Conservative backbenchers have suggested. Shadow cabinet members have been asked to make contact with their opposite numbers in government, and several have done so by raising issues of concern in the way the crisis is being dealt with. The new shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has already peppered Rishi Sunak with questions about the Treasury’s economic rescue package. It is unclear in what form parliament will return after the Easter recess. Select committees have continued to hold meetings by video link since the lockdown began."
2020-04-09T18:33:39Z,politics,Politics,Robert Jenrick's messages to the public: 'We need to stay at home',"He has been front and centre of Downing Street’s publicity campaign to get the country to follow lockdown rules to stop the spread of Covid-19. But on Thursday the Guardian revealed that Robert Jenrick has visited his own parents, who live 40 miles from his home. The housing and communities minister has delivered a consistent message in his public statements in recent weeks: Sky News, 22 March: The advice today is very clear: we need to stay at home all bar the most essential activities, and by doing that we’ll protect the NHS and help to save lives. I know it’s Mother’s Day and I know it’s tough and it goes against everything that we want to do as a family, but don’t go and see your mum. Give her a phone call, Skype her, FaceTime her, tell her that you love her and that we’re going to get through this together. Mail on Sunday comment piece, 22 March: We are facing a huge challenge on a scale not seen since the second world war. It’s not just a national emergency, it’s a global emergency – one which puts some of us at more risk than others. The choices that we must make over the coming days and weeks can save many lives. That means families making big sacrifices – especially today, on Mother’s Day. It’s so important that we speak to our loved ones as much as we can – whether that’s FaceTime or a phone call. But for now, we must practise social distancing in order to tackle the spread of the virus. We need to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. But while we create physical distance between ourselves, we must at the same time have closer social support for our neighbours. Downing Street press conference, 29 March: We each have a part to play by staying at home, protecting the NHS and helping to save lives. We all have a duty to one another to keep everyone safe. Twitter, 3 April: If you are considering going out this weekend, please don’t, unless it’s for work (where you cannot work from home), health reasons, food shopping or exercise. We need to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives."
2020-04-09T17:58:45Z,politics,Politics,Raab says he has not spoken to PM since hospital admission,"Dominic Raab has said he has not spoken to Boris Johnson since the prime minister was admitted to hospital, but insisted the government continued to function smoothly. Giving an update on Johnson’s health at Thursday’s coronavirus briefing, Raab said: “He is still in intensive care but he continues to make positive steps forward, and he is in good spirits.” Johnson has been described as sitting up, but he has not been playing any role in government decision-making while he receives treatment at St Thomas’ hospital in London. Asked if he had been in contact with the prime minister, Raab said: “Not yet. I think it’s important, particularly while he’s in intensive care, to let him focus on the recovery. We in the government have this covered.
“I chaired the Cobra meeting that I’ve just come from.

2020-04-09T17:56:41Z,politics,Politics,UK lockdown could end 'with sector-by-sector plan' for firms,"Ministers are looking at ending the coronavirus lockdown with a “gradual sector-by-sector approach” that could see vital industries such as manufacturing get back to work before less critical ones like entertainment, according to Whitehall sources. Two officials said one of the main options being explored for ending the lockdown was the idea of a phased return by industry, with civil servants in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy among those looking at how it could work. With UK-wide deaths at almost 900 a day, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, confirmed on Thursday that measures to stem the spread of the disease would remain in place until there is evidence that the number of fatalities has reached its peak. Raab – who is deputising for the prime minister while he remains in hospital with Covid-19 – told the daily Downing Street press conference that it was too early to lift the restrictions on people’s daily lives, without saying how long they would last for. “We are not done yet. We must keep going,” he said. “It’s been almost three weeks and we’re starting to see the impact of the sacrifices we’ve all made. But the deaths are still rising and we haven’t yet reached the peak of the virus. So it’s still too early to lift the measures that we put in place. We must stick to the plan and we must continue to be guided by the science.”
Downing Street has repeatedly refused to set out the options for how the UK could end the lockdown, but insisted that the government was doing “extensive work” on the various possibilities. The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “Work is underway on an exit strategy but the public wants us to be focused on stopping the spread of the disease while building up the NHS and saving lives … Whitehall is working extensively on this but the peak is not reached and the government needs to focus in its public messaging on staying at home to save lives.” Officials acknowledge it could be difficult to rank sectors according to their importance to the economy, how much social contact they involve and the strength of their protective measures to keep people apart. But they said it was more possible than other ideas that have been floated in recent days, such as letting 20 to 30-year-olds go back to their normal lives before older people. Other ideas that have been raised by government scientists include “alternating between periods of more and less strict social distancing measures” for most of the year or providing “immunity passports” to those who have had the disease, although that would only work with a functioning home antibody test. The lockdown measures – which were announced on 23 March – were first scheduled to be reviewed after three weeks, on Easter Monday. The legislation drawn up to implement the lockdown must be reviewed at least once every 21 days, making 16 April the latest this can be done. Raab chaired a Cobra emergency committee on Thursday afternoon to discuss the lockdown with leaders of the devolved nations and the mayor of London. He said on Thursday evening that the government did not expect to say more about the possible easing of physical distancing measures until the end of next week. It is understood that tightening the lockdown is under greater consideration at this point, although Priti Patel, the home secretary, told TalkRadio on Thursday that the government was “absolutely not” considering any further physical distancing measures. One official said some Tory ministers and advisers have been pushing for the lockdown to end sooner rather than later, but that the current thinking was that it would have to last for another six to eight weeks. Boris Johnson’s hospital admission and spell in intensive care had undermined the case of those pushing for schools and workplaces to soon get back to normal, the source said. Industry leaders were briefed at the end of last week on the government’s ideas about a possible sector-by-sector approach when the lockdown ends, with manufacturing, logistics and food supply companies likely to be at the front of the queue if they are not still open already. One person familiar with the government’s thinking said that the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, was concerned about the idea, fearing compliance with the rules would collapse once the public could see workers from some sectors returning to a more normal life. The government’s scientific advisers remain particularly concerned about the risk of a second wave of infections if the rules are relaxed too soon, the source said – but Whitehall officials are conscious of the prime minister’s desire to see them loosened as soon as possible. Johnson and his ministers have acknowledged that widespread testing will be part of the answer, but the scientific advisers have said the capacity to roll out mass testing for live cases across the population is unlikely. Labour is pushing for the government to publish an exit strategy even though the end of the lockdown is likely to be some way off, as the public would need to have confidence in the approach and time to get used to the idea. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the recently appointed shadow home secretary, said: “While we acknowledge the difficulty in putting precise times on the strategy, one of the key reasons publication is necessary is to enable frontline emergency services to plan effectively. “This is especially important in areas such as policing, where clear plans will need to be in place to ensure a managed process. That is why I urge the home secretary to help get an exit strategy published, as it’s a vital part of securing public confidence in the government’s approach.”"
2020-04-09T14:25:18Z,politics,Politics,Labour: Corbynites seek to regroup after Keir Starmer victory,"The Labour MP Richard Burgon hopes to relaunch the socialist Campaign Group as a leftwing rival to the Fabian Society, as Corbynites seek to regroup following Keir Starmer’s leadership victory. Burgon, who is MP for Leeds East, came third in the deputy leadership race with 21.3% of the vote in the final round on Saturday, but his campaign, which won the backing of the Unite trade union, was widely regarded as a bid to become the spokesman for the left wing of the party from the backbenches. “It’s a platform which he will extend and build on, to keep putting those ideas forward,” said an ally, who underlined the comparison with the Fabians. Burgon’s most eye-catching policy was the idea that Labour members should be given a vote on whether the party’s leader should support any military action not backed by the UN. He called it a “peace pledge”.
Allies say he and John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, are working to beef up the longstanding Campaign Group, the caucus of socialist MPs behind Corbyn’s candidacy for the leadership in 2015. The revamped organisation is expected to organise events and produce research and policy recommendations, as well as providing allied MPs with support. Burgon expects to play a leading role. The Fabian Society, founded in 1884 to “educate, agitate, organise”, was involved in the creation of the Labour party and has remained affiliated to it, publishing research papers and acting as what it calls a “pluralist, non-factional forum” for developing political ideas. Starmer’s shadow cabinet includes 15 Fabian members, according to the society. Momentum, the grassroots campaign group Jon Lansman set up to support Corbyn’s leadership, is also under pressure to reinvent itself after failing to propel its chosen candidate, Rebecca Long-Bailey, into Labour’s top job. Senior Momentum officials issued a statement on Tuesday saying the organisation could not continue as it had been, calling for “unity, reflection and comradely debate on the way forward”. “At the present moment, our movement is in great peril of making the same mistakes we did after our defeat in the 1980s. We risk retreating from the challenge of making our ideas mainstream, fighting between ourselves and allowing our party to be taken over once more by centrists,” the statement said. It appeared to be an attempt to pre-empt the launch the next day of a ginger group called Forward Momentum, which is calling for movement to be more grassroots-led and democratic, and less London-centric.
The group is expected to stand candidates for election to Momentum’s national governing council in May, in what appears to be an attempt to dilute Lansman’s control. As well as failing to back the winner in the leadership race, Momentum’s candidates were defeated in parallel elections for two seats on Labour’s governing national executive committee (NEC). The NEC has sweeping powers over party processes and policies. It took Corbyn more than two years to achieve a consistent majority on it. A spokesperson for Momentum said: “We want to see a Labour government and we will use our campaigning tools to make that happen. We’ll continue to push big ideas. And we are going to work to ensure that Keir sticks to his promises.” Starmer adopted much of Labour’s 2019 general election manifesto during his leadership campaign. He published 10 pledges, which included abolishing universal credit, scrapping tuition fees and increasing taxes on the top 5% of earners. His shadow cabinet reshuffle, however, involved a comprehensive clearout of close Corbyn allies, with Burgon joining Jon Trickett, Dan Carden and Ian Lavery on the backbenches. Diane Abbott and John McDonnell had already made clear they would step aside. Long-Bailey, who came second in the leadership contest, was one of the only survivors from the Campaign Group, and will now serve as shadow education secretary. Many Labour veterans see the hand of the canny political strategist McDonnell behind manoeuvres now taking place to ensure leftwing voices remain prominent. “John is mobilising on several fronts, and he’s adept at using proxies and ciphers,” said one senior party insider, joking that the shadow chancellor was “retiring to spend more time on politicking”. Another suggested McDonnell and Burgon were coordinating their efforts, and would take a “comradely” approach to Starmer."
2020-04-08T19:10:23Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak ditches the staight-talk for lessons from the old school | John Crace,"A week or so ago, Rishi Sunak appeared to be the cabinet outlier. The chancellor, who looked half the age of most of his colleagues, was the one most capable of delivering a press conference that connected with the country. Someone who can look people in the eye and accept responsibility for his actions. A rare quality in many politicians. Now, though, I’ve begun to wonder if Sunak’s impressive appearances at the daily Downing Street press conferences are less of a coincidence than they first appeared. Most of his older colleagues grew up on films and comics that still glorified or celebrated the second world war – beating the beastly Hun – so it’s no surprise perhaps that they are stuck in the mindset of the coronavirus as a battle to be won. An enemy to be beaten. The chancellor comes with none of that baggage. He wasn’t even alive when the first Star Wars film came out and was just two when ET was released. His childhood battles have been largely lived through light sabres and phasers. His cultural references belong to a different generation to those brought up on sticking it to Jerry. In short, he can speak 21st century human. It’s also fair to say Rishi has had to grow up fast. In his six months or so as chancellor, Sajid Javid didn’t get to deliver a single budget. In just under two months, Sunak is now on to his fourth. The first was the Brexit budget, that was largely a work of complete fantasy designed purely to reassure many in the Conservative party that everything was going to be just fine once we left the EU. Then came the first coronavirus budget for those on PAYE. Then the second for the self-employed. Now we have a third for the charity sector. Don’t rule out more in the coming weeks for those groups he comes to realise he’s still forgotten about. Not that Sunak could pretend he was doing more than a modest bail-out. The charity sector has been hit by £4bn losses and many staff lay offs, and all the chancellor had to offer was a relatively modest £750m package for those in the front line of fighting the coronavirus. But at least he was straightforward about what he was doing. No pretence that he could save every charity or every job. He even talked about the new spirit of people depending upon one another. Of kindness and decency. Words that would have had the near invisible Priti Patel and the all too visible Iain Duncan Smith choking on their early evening drinks. Despite insisting that it had moved at lightning pace from the start, the reality is the government spent the first two months doing next to nothing and has been playing a desperate game of catch up ever since. No amount of showing the same slide at every press briefing about how fewer people were using public transport was going to change that. Sunak’s three coronavirus budgets have been sticking plasters at best. Very expensive ones. The first misstep came when Sunak and the two health advisers tried to pretend that Prof Chris Whitty hadn’t said that testing had been key to Germany’s much lower mortality rate. He had. I and millions of others had heard him say just that. So trying to imply the Germans had cheated a bit by testing so many people and that the UK’s death rate might be just as low if we had done as much testing just felt shabby. All of a sudden, straight-talking Rishi didn’t appear quite so straight-talking. And he was also happy to let another minister break the news that the lockdown was not going to end any time soon. He was just there for the fun stuff.
Or maybe not quite. Sunak’s most terrifying utterance came almost as an afterthought. Asked whether, given that many economists have forecast that the coronavirus could hit GDP by more than 5% and send the UK into recession, it might not be a good moment to hit the pause button on the government’s commitment to ending transition at the end of the year, Sunak went into swivel-eyed Europhobe. The EU were an untrustworthy bunch of bastards and getting shot of them – even if it cost a million more jobs – was a price more than worth paying. Nothing would stop us leaving on December 31st. Not mass starvation. Not mass unemployment. Nothing. It was his commitment to the British people to make them as poor as was necessary. Maybe, Mr Nice Guy had been reading some of Boris’s old War Picture Library comics after all."
2020-04-08T18:24:42Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel accused of avoiding MPs’ scrutiny during national crisis,"The home secretary, Priti Patel, has been accused by an influential group of MPs of avoiding scrutiny at a time of national emergency, a tranche of correspondence has revealed. Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, has written to Patel six times – most recently in a letter issued on Wednesday – in an attempt to fix a date for the home secretary to give evidence in public to the committee, but a date for a hearing has not been confirmed. After repeatedly ignoring correspondence from Cooper, Patel replied to the committee chair on Tuesday telling her she was “disappointed at the increasingly adversarial tone of our exchanges” and declining an invitation to give evidence remotely on 15 April. She reluctantly agreed to appear before the MPs at the end of the month, but did not set a date. Cooper, in her latest missive, points out that the justice secretary, work and pensions secretary, transport secretary and health secretary have given evidence to their select committees already or have agreed a date to do so. The committee has been pressing Patel to provide evidence since the end of January, during which time the secretary of state has been accused of belittling officials and presiding over an “atmosphere of fear” at the Home Office. Sir Philip Rutnam resigned as permanent secretary at the Home Office, claiming constructive dismissal and accusing Patel of bullying her subordinates. Cooper wrote on Wednesday: “Delaying until the end of the month would clearly be inappropriate given the urgency of the public information and answers that are needed.” The letters reveal Patel has been pressing for “private briefings” instead of appearing in public but the committee declined as it believed this was “not sufficient”. On 7 April, Patel wrote to Cooper defending the proposal, which she argued “strikes an important balance between ensuring the department receives that vital scrutiny, while ensuring the committee can receive operationally sensitive, and sometimes classified, updates at this time of national emergency. “I am disappointed at the increasingly adversarial tone of our exchanges and I am very sorry that you have declined my offer of regular briefings with officials and ministers at the Home Office,” Patel wrote. Last week, Cooper wrote to Patel emphasising that the home secretary had been sent four previous requests to give evidence on 27 March, 20 March, 6 March and 29 January. “No response has yet been forthcoming,” Cooper wrote. Before the lockdown, Cooper wrote to Patel on 20 March, stating: “In the light of the escalating coronavirus crisis, we believe it is urgent and essential that we hear from you.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The home secretary has accepted the invitation to appear in front of the home affairs select committee before the end of April. “As expected, she is currently leading the Home Office response during this national crisis, working tirelessly to keep the British public safe.”"
2020-04-08T17:51:26Z,politics,Politics,"Boris Johnson improving and sitting up in bed, chancellor says","Boris Johnson remains in intensive care but his condition is improving and he is sitting up in his hospital bed, the chancellor has said. Rishi Sunak said the prime minister was “engaging positively” with medical staff as he gave an update on Johnson’s condition at a press conference on Wednesday afternoon. He said Johnson was receiving “excellent care”, adding: “The latest from the hospital is the prime minister remains in intensive care where his condition is improving. “I can also tell you that he has been sitting up in bed and engaging positively with the clinical team. “The prime minister is not only my colleague and my boss but also my friend, and my thoughts are with him and his family.”
Sunak was later pressed on whether Johnson had received enough medical support while he was unwell, and if it was true he was only told to go to hospital following a Zoom call with his GP on Sunday. The chancellor said: “I think the prime minister has received excellent care and advice at every step of the process. At the end of the day, we are all trying our best, none of us are superhuman and impervious to getting sick during this process and that’s what makes this thing so awful ... as I’ve observed and seen, the care has been excellent.” He said politicians and officials had been “doing their best to follow the guidelines” following concerns that high numbers of those working on the coronavirus response in Westminster have been struck down with the disease. Insisting the government was still functioning well, he said: “There is a good update on the prime minister’s condition and those who have been away many are now returning to work. But whether people are away or social distancing or in the same place, the business of government throughout all of this has gone on at pace.” Johnson has been in St Thomas’ hospital since Sunday night, when he was first admitted to the care of a team led by the respiratory expert Dr Richard Leach.
He was moved to intensive care on Monday night after his condition deteriorated. No 10 said he had not been placed on a ventilator at any point and did not have pneumonia. They did not reveal further details, such as whether Johnson had any type of secondary infection. The prime minister was said to be “responding to treatment” in an update on Wednesday lunchtime.
No 10 has been receiving medical updates from doctors at St Thomas’ but Johnson is now not doing any work at all. He was working on his red box of government papers even after being admitted to hospital, up until when he was admitted to intensive care. Johnson’s spokesman said he was able to be in contact with No 10 if necessary. However, he has not spoken to Dominic Raab, who is deputising for him, since going into hospital."
2020-04-08T16:13:34Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit: UK plan to agree trade deal by December is fantasy, says EU","Boris Johnson’s plan to seal a deal with Brussels on the future relationship with the UK by the end of December has been described as “fantasy land” by EU officials, as a leaked letter revealed the scale of the bloc’s inability to function during the coronavirus pandemic. The European council headquarters, where member states’ positions are coordinated, is only able to hold one daily video conference due to a lack of facilities. The capacity to carry out work is 25% of what it would usually be. The leaked letter from Michael Clauss, the German ambassador to the EU, to his political bosses in Berlin said a range of issues not key to rebuilding from the pandemic would need to be sidelined as a result. An EU official said while the European commission, which is in charge of talks with the UK, had better facilities for remote negotiation, it would be impossible for the member states to have the same input through the EU council. This would make a successful negotiation nearly impossible. The December timeline for agreeing a deal with the EU “which was already hopelessly optimistic” was described as “like fantasy land”, by one source. The UK can agree with the EU to extend the transition period by up to one or two years, if necessary, but Downing Street insisted it would not do so. The planned schedule of negotiating rounds on the future relationship was abandoned after the first week due to the pandemic. The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, will speak to his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, next week to try to agree a new timetable and method for the talks. Barnier is recovering after contracting coronavirus but Johnson remains in intensive care with the disease. Germany takes over the rolling EU presidency on 1 July from Croatia. It will be responsible for chairing key meetings and finding compromise positions on issues, including Brexit. However, the German ambassador to the EU wrote that it would not be possible to look beyond the need to rebuild the EU economy. He said: “From now on, the focus will be on the ability of the European institutions to act, crisis management, exit and reconstruction – possibly maintaining the EU integration itself. The success of our presidency will be measured against this.” Clauss said other key issues would “inevitably be overlaid or completely receded” as the EU’s ability to act will “remain broadly limited until further notice”, according to the letter leaked to German magazine Der Spiegel. Due to physical distancing rules, which are likely to remain even when lockdowns across Europe are lifted, the usual 21 boardrooms available for internal negotiations will be reduced to five. These will have to be shared with the EU’s foreign affairs wing, the European External Action Service. “The council secretariat strongly recommends planning only with one video conference per day,” the letter said. It added that the EU was having to use a commercially available end-to-end encryption service. Four new video conferencing systems set up in the European parliament are also said not to meet the required level of confidentiality. The ambassador wrote: “Video conferences, even if they can be carried out, will not be able to replace physical meetings on an equal footing. No formal quorum, no marginalised conversations, no confidentiality of the negotiations, no interpreting. Difficulties in text work.” A UK government spokesman said: “We remain fully committed to the negotiations and as we have been clear, discussions with the commission are continuing, with the aim of reaching an agreement by the end of the year. The transition period ends on 31 December 2020, as enshrined in EU law, which the Prime Minister has made clear he has no intention of changing.”"
2020-04-08T15:11:51Z,politics,Politics,Coronavirus jobs bailout could cost Treasury '£40bn every three months',"The government’s plan to subsidise the wages of workers affected by the Covid-19 lockdown of the economy could end up costing the Treasury £40bn for every three months the scheme is operating, a thinktank has said. Following estimates from a leading employers’ organisation that at least a third of workers in the private sector were likely to be furloughed, the Resolution Foundation said it had upped its estimate of the bill the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, would face.
Sunak has announced that the state will pay up to 80% of the wages of workers sent home by their companies because they have nothing to do during the period while large chunks of the economy are at a standstill. In its latest weekly update the British Chambers of Commerce said 20% of companies that had responded to its survey were planning to furlough all their staff and two-thirds said they would furlough 75-100% of their workforce in the coming week. Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation, said: “Faced with an unprecedented economic crisis, the chancellor has set out a bold and ambitious job retention scheme to limit job losses, and help firms recover as quickly as possible once the pandemic is over.
“By subsidising up to 80% of workers’ wages, the scheme will also help millions of workers who would otherwise face catastrophic hits to their living standards.” The Treasury is working on plans for how the UK might come out of the lockdown imposed in the middle of last month, but any strategy will involve a gradual opening up of the economy to minimise the impact of reinfection. According to the Resolution Foundation’s estimates, the cost of the furlough scheme could amount to 2% of national income – gross domestic product – per quarter, and on current trends it appears likely that financial help for some sectors of the economy will last for at least six months.
Bell said: “The cost of the scheme depends on firms’ take-up and the length of time workers need to be furloughed for. But with recent surveys implying that at least a third of the private sector workforce could be paid through the scheme, it is likely to cost as much as £30bn to £40bn over three months. “The economic and social cost of mass unemployment in the absence of such a scheme would be far, far greater.”"
2020-04-08T13:28:09Z,politics,Politics,Briton who organised Cambodia rescue flight criticises UK officials,"A British traveller who organised a flight for his family and about 100 others stuck in Cambodia has criticised the government’s sluggish response and warned that travellers risk being stranded abroad with no funds after spending thousands on cancelled flights. Jerry Lewis, a teacher who was travelling in Cambodia with his family, became so disillusioned with the British embassy’s failure to help tourists that he contacted the chief operating officer of Malaysia Airlines to inquire about arranging a flight home. When the airline initially confirmed that it would send a plane, Lewis contacted the British embassy in Phnom Penh hoping that staff there would oversee the plan. He received only a standard email response and resorted to coordinating the flight with his wife, Karen Lewis.
After contacting other stranded travellers through a Facebook group, they managed to bring 103 people back to Heathrow on 28 March. Tickets, which cost about £1,000, were offered on a first-come-first-served basis. About 250 tourists, including young backpackers and retirees, are understood to remain stuck in Cambodia, while tens of thousands more Britons are still scattered around the world. Last week, the government pledged £75m to charter special flights to “priority countries”, and provide affordable seats on commercial airlines. Planes have been chartered to Peru, India, South Africa and Nepal, but many travellers stuck in countries where commercial airlines are still operating are yet to benefit. In Cambodia, the British embassy has continued to advise people to book commercial flights over the past week, even though these cost thousands of pounds and have repeatedly been cancelled, with passengers unable to secure quick refunds. On Tuesday the British embassy began surveying interest for a commercial flight leaving on 13 April, though officials say it will only go ahead if it is commercially viable. There is a possibility of financial support, travellers were told, but the details are unclear. Lewis questioned why he and his wife, private citizens, had been able to organise a flight more quickly than embassy staff for roughly the same price. “I’ve watched the French, the Germans, the Swiss getting repatriated and I see British people still stuck there and being told to book commercial flights – the same advice – when they’ve already booked two, three, four, five, some even six commercial flights and they’ve lost all their money,” said Lewis.
He fears some people won’t be able to afford the embassy flight because they are still awaiting refunds. In total, it has cost his family of five about £11,000 to get home. While the number of coronavirus cases recorded in Cambodia was low and travellers were safe, the global crisis was moving rapidly, he added, and it was possible the situation there might change. “The government might have a state of emergency, they could make any rule – they could shut shops, shut hotels, stop all flights. It’s the anxiety, the not knowing,” he said. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “Our consular teams are doing everything they can, especially for those in difficulty, to keep Brits informed on the latest developments and help them return – on commercial flights where they are still available or special charter flights as well. We’ll continue working around the clock to bring people home.”"
2020-04-08T11:02:13Z,politics,Politics,"Fraudsters likely to target furlough scheme, says HMRC chief","A senior civil servant has said he expects organised crime will target the government’s multibillion-pound employee furlough scheme. The job retention scheme, which pays 80% of an employee’s salary up to £2,500 a month for up to three months, is due to come online for employers to make claims on 20 April. Jim Harra, the chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs, told a committee of MPs that he expected it to be targeted by fraudsters. “We are going to be paying out a vast sum of money in a rapid period of time,” Harra told the Treasury select committee on Wednesday. “Any scheme like this is a target for organised crime. Any scheme that pays out I’m afraid attracts criminals that want to defraud it and people that are genuinely entitled to it who inflate their claims.” Anthony Browne, a Tory member of the committee, asked Harra how far the scheme was “open to abuse”, saying he had seen estimates that the government could end out paying £30bn to £40bn, although City economists have put a potentially far higher figure on the cost. Harra said HMRC had four “lines of defence” to stop fraudsters, including a whistleblower hotline. A key safeguard is the stipulation that an employee has to have been on a payroll on 28 February in order to claim, which should prevent the creation of claims using fake employees. Other measures include: The requirement for an employer to have already been authenticated by HMRC. A four- to six-day processing period to make background checks, which should flag high-risk claims. Checks made after payout to verify a claim was real. “We have to get a scheme set up rapidly and time has been the enemy of perfection in this,” Harra said. “We believe we are striking the right balance protecting the exchequer from abuse and the imperative to get help out to those that need it as fast as we possibly can.” Harra said he had a “high level of confidence” that the online system being set up to take employer claims would not crash. HMRC said it had begun testing the system on Wednesday with a “small number of invited employers” before the full launch on 20 April. “We are confident that the IT will cope with the very large volume of claims we expect to receive,” he said. “On the IT side we have tested up to 450,000 claims an hour.” He admitted that if a very large number of employers phoned HMRC for help, its call centres “would struggle to provide the service we want”. Harra said there were about 2,000 staff already dedicated to the helplines, and another 3,500 other employees would be redeployed to help deal with the huge number of claims expected when the service launches. In terms of numbers of claimants, Harra said there were about 2 million PAYE schemes in the UK, with some employers using more than one scheme, covering about 30 million employees. He did not know the expected level of claimants, although there have been estimates of a minimum of 10% of employers. “We expect a very large number of those to claim in the first few days,” he said. “Claimants will be queued if necessary – anyone who has tried to get online shopping will know what that is like – but claims can be made online 24 hours a day, seven days a week.”"
2020-04-08T10:25:00Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock asks industry to help find viable coronavirus test,"The health secretary, Matt Hancock, will ask industry leaders to help the UK find an antibody test that works. Hancock will issue the plea on a conference call on Wednesday, echoing his call for help on ventilators, after the government conceded that none of the antibody tests it has are good enough for mass usage. Biotech companies will be asked to help identify and mass-produce a fingerprick test that is accurate enough to offer to the general population to see if they have had coronavirus. At the moment the UK is relying on laboratory tests to show whether a patient currently has coronavirus, and there is capacity to test 14,000 people a day – typically those in hospital, care homes or prisons, or NHS workers.
The government is targeting 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, with both types – lab tests and fingerprick tests – making up the total. But it looks increasingly unlikely that an antibody test will be ready in time. Experts believe both types are needed to help at least partially end the lockdown and start returning people to work. The UK has been criticised for its slow start on ramping up testing. Edward Argar, a health minister, said on Wednesday that the UK “hasn’t got the testing issue wrong”, after Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said there were lessons to learn from Germany’s high testing rate and slower increase in deaths.
Argar, who toured the broadcast studios, said the UK recognised it needed to ramp up the number of tests being carried out but he downplayed the importance of Germany as a model to follow. He said the UK was seeing “rapid increases in testing” and Hancock was determined to meet his target of 100,000 a day. Asked about Whitty’s view that Germany had “got ahead” on testing, Argar said there were other factors in the country’s apparent success in flattening its curve. “I would absolutely expect him to say we need to look at what other countries have done that has had a really positive impact,” he told Sky News. “But I would come back to his caveats in which he did also say there were a whole range of factors for why Germany’s death rate does at the moment appear to be lower.” He also repeated suggestions that the UK lockdown was likely to be extended next week, even though the government has refused to confirm that. “We need to start seeing the numbers coming down and that’s when you’re in the negative,” he told BBC Breakfast. “That’s when you have a sense when that’s sustained over a period of time, that you can see it coming out of that. We’re not there yet and I don’t exactly know when we will be.” Experts have said the UK should not be coming out of the lockdown without developing a clear strategy for stamping out the virus through mass testing.
Whitty, when asked on Tuesday about the differences with Germany, said: “We all know that Germany got ahead in terms of its ability to do testing for the virus, and there’s a lot to learn from that.” Germany is able to test 500,000 patients a week and is under pressure to increase this further. The government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, had given a more circumspect reply, saying: “The German curve looks as though it’s lower at the moment, and that is important, and I don’t have a clear answer to exactly what is the reason for that.”"
2020-04-08T05:00:08Z,politics,Politics,Methadone to be supplied without new prescription during Covid-19 crisis,"Pharmacists are to be allowed to hand out a range of super-strength medicines, including the heroin substitute methadone, without prescription during the Covid-19 crisis, under emergency measures that official drug policy advisers have warned could trigger a spike in drug misuse. The Advisory Council for Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), which makes recommendations to the government on the control of dangerous drugs, was asked by the home secretary to consider the risks of lifting restrictions on certain substances controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Some of the substances covered by the proposals are highly addictive and include barbiturates and opiates, such as morphine, as well as medicines used for opioid substitution therapy. The harm reduction initiative offers people who are dependent on opioids such as heroin an alternative, typically methadone or buprenorphine. The emergency changes proposed would allow pharmacists to hand out these substances without prescription, although only to patients who have been receiving the medicine as part of their treatment. In its response, the 21-member council, chaired by Dr Owen Bowden-Jones, ultimately supported the proposals but warned that the move could lead to a rise in drug misuse. The council said: “The measure would rely on the professional judgment of pharmacists, who will be working outside the scope of their usual practice. “Without adequate support and guidance for the healthcare professionals affected by the proposed legislative change, there is a risk that pharmacists struggling to follow best practices could inadvertently lead to an increase in drug misuse and diversion. This is a particular risk for patient groups requiring opioid pain medicines, eg for palliative care or for opioid substitution therapy (OST). “Additionally, whilst it will be necessary for the government to publicly announce in an emergency that these measures are to apply, common knowledge of the applicability of this measure may increase the risk of the misuse and diversion of controlled drugs. “For example, patients with substance misuse issues might attempt to place pressure on a pharmacist to dispense in accordance with this measure, or might visit a range of pharmacists in an attempt to locate and exploit weaknesses in any of their practices in order to be supplied with medicines against best practice.” However, the council said that there was a risk that some GP surgeries could close during the pandemic as a result of staff shortages from illness or self-isolation, which might mean some patients being unable to access repeat prescriptions. “A discontinuity of supply would pose a particular risk for patients receiving OST,” the council said. “In the event that GP surgeries were closed during the pandemic, those patients might find they had less support and oversight from the relevant healthcare professionals, leading to an increased risk of relapse to illicit drug use.” The ACMD recommended that national-level guidance is produced in consultation with doctors and pharmacists before the measures are put in place. In addition, the Home Office wants to apply a measure called a supply shortage protocol to certain controlled drugs, which would allow pharmacists to hand out alternatives without having to go back to doctors in the event that the prescribed drug is running low, as there is a “significant risk” to supply due to the crisis. The Council was broadly supportive of the measure but recommended this is only done as a last resort. A Home Office spokesperson said: “These measures will help patients to access the medications they need without having to make frequent trips to the pharmacy. This will relieve pressure on our healthcare system and encourage people to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. “We are grateful to the ACMD for addressing these proposals urgently, and we will consider their response carefully.”"
2020-04-07T19:23:25Z,politics,Politics,"Leadership, Jim, but not as we know it with Captain Raab on bridge | John Crace","It’s now all down to a matter of trust. Last June, the Conservative party decided it didn’t rate Dominic Raab highly enough for him to even make the last five of the leadership contest. Imagine the humiliation of being considered to have less credibility than Michael Gove. Yet now, with Boris Johnson in intensive care, Raab is the interim leader of the country at a time of national emergency. “You’ve got to ask yourself one question. Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?” The answer for most of us is a resounding “no”. We don’t feel in the slightest bit lucky, thank you. Neither, it seems, does Raab. The gap between vaulting ambition and practical reality has never seemed so wide. When he looks in the mirror, Dom no longer sees the decisive man of action he has always imagined himself to be. Rather he just gazes at uncertainty and hesitancy. The crown weighs far more heavily than he had ever anticipated. He can’t even trust himself these days. The day before, he had insisted Boris was on top form and running the country from his hospital bed. Just three hours later, we were told the prime minister had been moved to intensive care. In the meantime, the Govester doesn’t even trust Dom to make the coffee at cabinet meetings It’s hard to come back from that. Either the foreign secretary had been kept out of the loop about Boris’s state of health or he had lied to the country. Neither of which was a good look for the man whose prime responsibility was to bring a sense of reassurance and stability to a country worried about the health of its leader. Boris might not be everyone’s idea of a national Daddy, but he’s the only Daddy we’ve got and no one wants to lose their Dad. It’s as primal and terrifying as that. The country hasn’t felt this anxious and unsettled in decades. Raab didn’t look quite as sweaty and edgy on Tuesday as he had the day before: instead, the panic resided entirely in his eyes that darted this way and that, avoiding direct contact with everyone. He started by getting to the question everyone wanted answered. The prime minister had been stable overnight, was receiving the best care and had needed no invasive ventilation. Good news. “I’m confident he’ll pull through,” he said. “He’s a fighter.” Cue a collective groan of despair. We were back in the mythology of plucky Brits single-handedly taking on the Hun. Fighting the coronavirus on the beaches and in the hedgerows. We’re not in a war. We’re in a pandemic. The two things are totally different. And the many thousands who have already died from the disease did not do so because they were too weak or didn’t fight hard enough. They died because they were too ill to live and there was nothing the doctors could do to save them. The foreign secretary was no more convincing on who actually was running the country in Boris’s absence. “Government has always worked on collective responsibility,” he said casually. Er, yes. Except the buck has always stopped with the prime minister. Now it seemed the buck stopped nowhere. All that was happening was that the entire cabinet was gathering round a crystal ball, while trying to channel the inner spirit of Boris. And what was coming back was presumably total gibberish, as it’s been well documented that in the week Boris was in isolation in Downing Street the entire cabinet was squabbling like rats in a sack. Some have never even left the sack. Despite being home secretary, Priti Patel has never been allowed anywhere near a No 10 press briefing. Small mercies, I suppose. In the meantime, the Govester doesn’t even trust Dom to make the coffee at cabinet meetings. God knows what would happen if there was another serious emergency, such as floods or a terrorist attack. The entire cabinet would be briefing against each other, with each person having a different idea of what Boris would really have wanted. Presumably Mikey and Dom have already arm-wrestled one another for possession of the nuclear button. It’s leadership, Jim, but not as we know it. Nor did persistent questioning from the media about who really was in charge result in any more clarity. Everyone was just getting on and doing what Boris would have wanted, even though the circumstances might since have changed. All that did become clear was that Raab’s idea of collective responsibility was every man and woman for themselves. Asked about the government’s commitment to 100,000 tests by the end of the month, Dom casually threw Matt Hancock, the health sercretary, under the wheels of a bus. Nothing to go with me, Guv. Ask Tigger. The only person to really level with the country was the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty. Thank goodness, he’s back. After the chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance had observed that the UK’s death rates were broadly in line with Italy, Spain and France, Whitty alone dared to comment on why Germany’s might be so much lower. Testing, testing, testing. The Germans had taken the coronavirus more seriously at a much earlier stage than other countries and had planned accordingly. The UK was paying the price for its government having been too slow to act. There was one adult in Downing Street, then. Just a shame he’s not in the cabinet. Still, perhaps after Wednesday morning’s fantasy football “What would Boris do next?” cabinet meeting, one minister will be available to tell us who really is running the country while the prime minister recovers in hospital."
2020-04-07T18:28:07Z,politics,Politics,Johnson siblings' bond strong as ever as family faces toughest test,"Through decades of personal and political clashes, the Johnson family seem to have maintained a remarkable bond – and as Boris is treated in intensive care, the ties with the rest of his clan are as indelible as ever. Their ties have been tested by the most severe political storms. When the now prime minister Johnson became the face of the leave camp during the EU referendum, his siblings Rachel, Leo, and Jo passionately made the case for the UK to remain in the bloc. Rachel joined the newly formed and now defunct Change UK (she would later describe herself as a “rat that jumped on to a sinking ship”), while Jo dealt an extraordinary blow to his brother’s premiership after he quit as an MP and minister, citing an “unresolvable tension” between his family loyalty and the national interest. In her newly released memoir, Rachel notes: “Doing what we are told not to do is a family trait.” So when the prime minister ordered the country to stay at home and practise social distancing last month in an effort to deal with the coronavirus epidemic, it probably came as no surprise that their father Stanley, a former MEP, defied him, insisting: “Yes of course I’ll go to the pub if I need to go to a pub.” In recent days, the family has largely maintained a public silence – but they have expressed their support by other means.
All three siblings liked or retweeted Johnson’s message thanking hospital staff and tweets from well wishes from people across the political spectrum. Leo Johnson, whose recent activity on Twitter suggests he also approves of Labour’s new leader, Keir Starmer, liked a tweet by the Church of England praying for his brother’s recovery. The youngest sibling is the only one to stay out of politics, working instead for the firm PwC and appearing occasionally on BBC Radio 4. Coronavirus patients aren’t allowed visitors, which will undoubtedly be difficult for the close-knit family, particularly for Carrie Symonds, the prime minister’s fiancee, who is seven months pregnant. The 32-year-old is currently self-isolating after experiencing coronavirus symptoms herself. She and the Johnson family received a message from the Queen on Tuesday, saying they were in her thoughts and that she wished the prime minister a full and speedy recovery. Rachel has also publicly supported her brother’s response to the coronavirus. During last month’s appearance on ITV’s Loose Women, Rachel said: “I do support him, I think he’s doing an incredible job. “It’s hard to see somebody carrying such a weight of responsibility but he is strong. It’s really hard up there to know they’re doing the right decisions … this could crash the economy.” She added: “These are really, really dark times.” She was also quick to defend her father, Stanley, who was heavily criticised for saying he would ignore the government’s advice on how to avoid the coronavirus, admitting that while it was “a stupid thing to say”, her dad wasn’t trying to be “provocative”. Rachel has long dismissed suggestions that the ideological differences within her family have resulted in any strife. She tweeted last year: “I said last night at a charity do that the family avoids the topic of Brexit, especially at meals, as we don’t want to gang up on the PM!” In the book Just Boris: A Tale of Blond Ambition, author Sonia Purnell notes: “There is tension, yes, but little division among them. Constantly moving house meant it was nigh on impossible to form meaningful relationships with anyone else their own age, had they been urged to do so.” In a 2005 interview with Grove Magazine, Rachel said of her siblings: “We never, ever, went to play with other children. We didn’t need friends.” Their bond has clearly survived the test of time – and political crises."
2020-04-07T18:10:01Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Raab: PM's stand-in needs cabinet OK for big decisions,"Dominic Raab does not have full prime ministerial responsibility while deputising for Boris Johnson, with no power to hire and fire nor take major decisions without cabinet agreement. The foreign secretary was given the duty of standing in for Johnson “where appropriate” following the prime minister’s admission to intensive care on Monday night, but this is understood to relate mainly to the government’s coronavirus response, with no specific instructions to extend his reach into other areas.
If Raab himself were to become incapacitated, the next in command would be Rishi Sunak, the chancellor. Ministers refused to say on Tuesday whether Raab now has custody of the UK’s nuclear codes as a “matter of national security” but No 10 made clear that he would only be able to authorise military action if it were the collective decision of cabinet. Raab is also not charged with taking over Johnson’s weekly audience with the Queen, which has been cancelled while the prime minister remains incapacitated. The foreign secretary has not yet spoken to Johnson since his admission to intensive care, with their last conversation occurring on Saturday – before Johnson went to hospital. No 10 was reticent about whether the prime minister was still communicating with his deputy or officials, and said there was no information to provide on whether he can sit up, talk or stay in touch while in intensive care, where he remained on Tuesday night.
Speaking at the daily No 10 press conference, Raab said he had “clear instructions” from Johnson about what needed to be done, and the principle of collective decision-making by cabinet was no different from usual. But he avoided a question on whether he would be able to authorise a change in the direction of strategy if there is disagreement within the cabinet. With Johnson in hospital for a second day, Raab chaired the government’s daily coronavirus “war cabinet” meeting on Tuesday morning, where the chief advisers gave updates on the national situation. The meeting was also attended by Michael Gove and Sunak. However, some MPs and experts have raised concerns that Raab’s responsibilities need to be set out more clearly, particularly if Johnson remains unable to work. Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative former defence minister and current chair of the defence select committee, said: “It is important to have 100% clarity as to where responsibility for UK national security decisions now lies. We must anticipate adversaries attempting to exploit any perceived weakness.” Robert Hazell, professor of government and the constitution at University College London, said if Johnson is unwell for an extended period it will “be the cabinet who will discuss this and decide what to do”. They could install a caretaker prime minister followed by a leadership election, he said. Despite No 10’s assertion that Johnson has not given hiring and firing powers to Raab, Hazell said it would fall to him if necessary. “Ultimately, ministers are appointed and dismissed by the Queen and the Queen normally acts on the advice of the person who is the primary constitutional adviser, who is the prime minister. If the prime minister is incapacitated, she turns to the person who the prime minister has nominated, which is Dominic Raab.” He also thought Raab would have the technical power to go to the Queen to request a minister be dismissed if they had behaved so heinously the only option was a sacking. On whether Raab could take the UK to war when the prime minister is still in hospital, he said it would in theory be possible. “Suppose that the UK, or more likely one of its dependent territories, came under attack, suppose we had a rerun of the Falklands for example, I do not feel that he would say to Argentina: ‘This is very unsporting of you to do this while the prime minister is incapacitated.’ “He would ask Mark Sedwill [the cabinet secretary] to convene a special security council so the government is not disabled and take the decision.”
Hazell said “the cabinet manual is silent” on what happens if the PM is unable to return to his job because of illness. He said it would be likely that the cabinet “would have to decide who should be his successor and the cabinet would advise the Queen to make the appointment”. “In order to earn the confidence of the public, it could be a two-stage process, with a caretaker prime minister appointed ahead of a leadership election, which could take three months,” he said, adding that his hunch is that the caretaker would be someone who is not intending on running for leader. A sudden succession process was not unusual in the past but has not been triggered since the Victorian era. Seven British prime ministers have died in office, including William Pitt the Younger in 1806 and Spencer Perceval, who was assassinated in 1812. The Australian prime minister Harold Holt drowned in 1967. While there were no written rules on succession, ultimately the parliament decided the succession process."
2020-04-07T12:28:38Z,politics,Politics,Jewish leaders praise Keir Starmer for pledges on Labour antisemitism,"Keir Starmer has been praised by Jewish leaders for achieving “in four days more than his predecessor in four years” after he held a video conference to set out steps Labour would be taking to stamp out antisemitism. Starmer, who replaced Jeremy Corbyn as party leader on Saturday, told the meeting that he had asked for all outstanding investigations into antisemitism within the party to be “on my desk at the end of the week”. Following the meeting with Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner, Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of British Jews, Jonathan Goldstein, chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council, Gerald Ronson, chairman of the Community Security Trust and Mike Katz, chairman of the Jewish Labour Movement, issued a joint statement praising the steps that Starmer proposes to take. “While we would have fully understood the need to focus entirely on coronavirus at this time, Keir Starmer has already achieved in four days more than his predecessor in four years in addressing antisemitism within the Labour party,” they said. “As we discussed with Keir and Angela, we want to have a normal relationship with Labour whereby we can discuss the full range of issues affecting our community, from religious freedom to Israel, from Jewish schools to poverty, from refugees to the environment - and not just antisemitism. “This has certainly been a good start. If the new Labour leadership continues in this way, we can work together to make the changes that will make Labour a proudly anti-racist party once again.” The issue of antisemitism has troubled Labour for years, with the party still under investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission over allegations of institutional antisemitism in its handling of complaints. Starmer thanked the Jewish representatives for meeting with him “not least so close to Passover”. “It was very important to me to seek to address the disgrace of antisemitism in our party as soon as possible,” he said. “Today, I repeated once again the apology I made as soon as I was elected leader. Over the last few years, we have failed the Jewish community on antisemitism. “Labour is a proudly anti-racist party and, going forward, it will not be enough to ‘pass the test’ on antisemitism. We need to set new standards for best practice. “At today’s meeting, I committed to begin work on setting up an independent complaints process, cooperating fully with the EHRC’s inquiry and asking for a report on all outstanding cases to be on my desk at [the end of] the week. “I also discussed with the Jewish Labour Movement my ambition to roll out training of all Labour party staff as soon as practically possible.”"
2020-04-07T09:48:31Z,politics,Politics,Coronavirus lockdown: what are the UK's options for lifting restrictions?,"Four days ago, Boris Johnson was heralding a ramp-up of testing as “the way through the coronavirus puzzle”. His health secretary, Matt Hancock, was even floating the idea of immunity passports for people who could be confirmed as having recovered from the virus, so that they could return to work. But on Monday the government’s message was very different, following multiple reports that antibody tests were showing poor reliability. One government adviser, Prof Sir John Bell of Oxford University, said testing was at least a month away. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said it was too early yet to be talking about an exit strategy from the lockdown. Even discussing ways out could “confuse the messaging” about the importance of sticking to physical distancing rules, he added. While ministers and their advisers might not want to discuss exit strategies openly, the Guardian here explores four options. Mass testing and contact tracing When coronavirus first reached Britain, each suspected case was tracked down and tested. Those found positive self-isolated while their recent contacts were traced and asked to do the same. The strategy was abandoned in early March when the government changed tack from containing to delaying the outbreak. The move unleashed a wave of criticism. The World Health Organization has stressed throughout that testing, contact tracing and quarantine are vital steps towards bringing the pandemic under control. “We have got to be able to show that we can go after the virus, because lockdowns alone will not work,” Dr Michael Ryan, the WHO’s director of emergencies, said last week. Hancock has talked of scaling up tests to 100,000 a day, but there has been no official commitment to contact tracing. Despite this, both are more than likely to feature in the exit strategy. Prof Neil Ferguson, whose outbreak modelling team at Imperial College London is advising the government, said this weekend that if the lockdown sufficiently reduced new cases then mass testing and contact tracing would “almost certainly” be introduced to try to keep a lid on the pandemic. The strategy has its challenges. The UK is desperately building up its testing capacity but the expansion needed is unprecedented and other countries are competing for the same equipment and chemicals. Contact tracing is labour intensive, and scientists have called on Public Health England to recruit a volunteer army to help identify potential cases. One hope is that an NHS contact tracing app can help by sending alerts to users who come into contact with infected people. But the app has already raised privacy concerns: to be effective it would require about 40 million people in the UK to sign up and share their health and location data. Herd immunity and cocooning the vulnerable In the absence of a treatment or protective vaccine, the UK’s initial approach to weathering the outbreak was to keep the most vulnerable people “cocooned” while managing the spread of infections in the rest of the population. This would build the kind of “herd immunity” that is normally created through vaccination. If more than 60% of the population developed immunity, the outbreak could be brought under control. One of the problems with the strategy is that no one knows who is vulnerable. As the deaths of doctors, nurses and young children have shown, it is not only older people or those with underlying conditions who fail to recover from the virus. This means acquiring herd immunity by letting the virus sweep through puts a staggering number of lives at risk. With the lockdown and physical distancing in place, the number of new infections should steadily fall, and unless millions of infections have gone undetected, herd immunity is unlikely to develop in the current outbreak. According to Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University, one way out of the lockdown is to beef up protection around those who are known to be at risk. With intense testing of NHS workers, care home staff and others, the most vulnerable could be better shielded from the infection, drastically cutting the number of people who end up in intensive care. “That is where testing could really help get us out of this,” Woolhouse said. Alternating between tighter and looser lockdowns The lockdown and physical distancing are intended to spread the epidemic out so that hospitals do not face thousands of sick patients at once but rather a steadier stream over time. This “flattening of the curve” can save lives if intensive care units can treat and discharge the most seriously ill patients before new cases arrive. The Imperial College team that is modelling the outbreak found that the government may need to alternate between lockdown and looser rules, relaxing and then imposing the restrictions again if case numbers rebound as expected. This could potentially go on for months, depending on whether new antiviral drugs are found or a vaccine becomes available. “There is not going to be a cure for this, but if we can find a drug that works, and if we can give it to people early enough, you can stop them progressing to serious disease and needing a critical care bed,” said Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia. Antibody tests and immunity passports The government has ordered 17.5m antibody home-testing kits, but none have yet proved reliable. Some senior scientists say the tests may pick up only half of those who have had the virus, in part because people with milder infections tend to have lower levels of antibodies in their blood. The poor performance appears to scupper hopes for using the tests soon to issue “immunity passports” so that the immune can return to work – an idea under active consideration in the UK and Germany. Even if accurate tests can be obtained, they may not be the “game-changer” that Johnson has claimed. No one knows whether antibodies in the blood mean full or only partial protection against the virus, nor how long any protection would last, making immunity passports a shaky reassurance. But while antibody tests might not be that useful for individuals, they could still be extremely valuable for tracking the outbreak and deciding on the best way to exit the lockdown, according to Prof Eleanor Riley, of Edinburgh University. “If antibody testing suggests that, say, 40 or 50% of the population has already been exposed, any relaxing of the social distancing rules is less likely to lead to a second wave of serious infections than if only 1% of the population has been exposed,” she said."
2020-04-07T08:07:25Z,politics,Politics,"Boris Johnson 'stable' in intensive care and not on ventilator, says No 10","Boris Johnson remains in intensive care on oxygen but without the need for a ventilator and does not have pneumonia, No 10 has said. As Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, led his second daily coronavirus response meeting on Tuesday, Downing Street said at lunchtime on Tuesday that Johnson was “stable” overnight and remains “in good spirits”, despite his admission to intensive care at St Thomas’ hospital in London on Monday evening. No 10 would not confirm whether the prime minister was still communicating with officials or ministers by phone or whether he was in contact with family, but said his medical team were keeping Downing Street informed. Johnson has not spoken to Raab since Saturday, but a message was passed to the foreign secretary asking him to deputise. Raab has not taken on full prime ministerial powers, with No 10 and Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, stressing that any big decisions would be made collectively by the cabinet. He continues to work out of the Foreign Office, rather than No 10, and weekly prime ministerial meetings with the Queen have been suspended rather than passed to Raab. No 10 said Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is the next in line to take over were Raab to become incapacitated.
Amid concern Johnson had been working too hard through his illness, Gove said Johnson had “followed medical advice” at all times. In his round of broadcast interviews, Gove said the prime minister was fit, enjoyed tennis and had a “zest and appetite for life”, so it was “naturally concerning” how ill he was with coronavirus. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Gove said: “He’s not on a ventilator. He has received oxygen support and one of the reasons for being in intensive care is that he can receive any support he needs.” Hours after his comments, Gove said he was now isolating at home because a member of his family had been displaying Covid-19 symptoms since Sunday. He will not be able to take the government’s daily press conference in No 10 but can still chair and attend meetings from home.
Gove said Raab would be leading coronavirus response meetings and other cabinet committees but the “prime minister always remains the prime minister”. Gove said “decisions would be taken collectively and following appropriate advice” on when to end the lockdown. “But we do have to follow the lockdown advice because, as the prime minister’s case so powerfully reminds us, this disease can hit any of us and it can hit very badly.”
Gove said he could not talk about who had control of the nuclear codes if the country were to come under attack because it was a national security matter. He rejected the idea of a national unity government but said the opposition had been “exemplary” in saying members would support a united national effort to beat coronavirus. The prime minister was moved to intensive care on Monday evening. He remained conscious. A No 10 spokesman said on Monday: “Over the course of this afternoon, the condition of the prime minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the hospital. “The prime minister has asked foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who is the first secretary of state, to deputise for him where necessary. The PM is receiving excellent care, and thanks all NHS staff for their hard work and dedication.”
Intensive care beds are reserved for those who are very ill, and in the case of Covid-19, often those who need to be put on a mechanical ventilator to help them breathe. Since being admitted to St Thomas’, Johnson, 55, is understood to have received oxygen through a non-invasive mask. His pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds – herself recovering from coronavirus symptoms – was said to be deeply anxious about Johnson’s condition. News of his admission to hospital, 11 days after he developed a cough and high temperature, caused national and international concern, with world leaders from the US president, Donald Trump, to the French leader, Emmanuel Macron, sending their best wishes and hopes for Johnson’s recovery. Trump said on Monday: “We’re very saddened to hear that [Johnson] was taken into intensive care this afternoon, a little while ago, and Americans are all praying for his recovery. He’s been a really good friend. He’s been really something very special: strong, resolute, doesn’t quit, doesn’t give up.”
Shortly after the announcement, Raab appeared on the airwaves with an attempt to reassure the public, saying government business would continue. He told the BBC there was an “incredibly strong team spirit” behind Johnson and that ministers would focus on delivering the plans he had put in place. He said the prime minister was in safe hands and receiving excellent care, and vowed that the government would bring the whole country through the pandemic. Buckingham Palace said of the Queen: “Her Majesty has been kept informed by No 10.”"
2020-04-07T05:36:24Z,politics,Politics,'Full-scale emergency': what the papers say about Boris Johnson's move to intensive care,"The sharp decline in Boris Johnson’s health makes for a series of grave front pages on Tuesday. The Times’ headline reads “PM in intensive care” and reports on sources saying that Johnson needed four litres of oxygen. The papers says this is well below the normal threshold of 15 litres and suggests the prime minister’s case is not as serious as some admitted to ICU.
The Guardian’s splash headline is “Johnson taken to intensive care after virus symptoms worsen”. Simon Jenkins, one of the paper’s columnists, wishes Johnson a speedy recovery but says that we must recognise that “the machinery of government is malfunctioning” in his absence.
The Mirror says “Sick Boris faces fight for life” across a picture of a pallid-looking Johnson taken from a government video last week. It agrees that the PM’s illness “raises some awkward questions” for the way the country is being run and says cabinet ministers will never be forgiven if they are seen to be scoring points off each other in a fight for a potential succession.
The Mail also chooses the same image as the Mirror alongside a headline reading “Now stricken Boris taken to intensive care”. It also notes that his pregnant girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, is self-isolating in London and has been unable to see him.
The Mail reports inside on how “the crisis over Boris Johnson’s health turned into a full-scale emergency”, with his doctor immediately telling him he had to go to hospital after seeing him struggling for breath on a conference call on Sunday.
The Sun headline says “Boris in intensive care” while the Metro says “PM put in intensive care unit” and the i opts for “Prime minister in intensive care with coronavirus”.
The Telegraph headline is “Johnson in intensive care” and on the inside pages the paper’s former editor, Charles Moore, is sharply critical of comments by the one-time Whitehall mandarin Lord Kerslake, who told the BBC that Johnson would have to “reflect on his position” if his illness continued. Citing the example of Winston Churchill, who suffered two bouts of serious illness during the second world war, Moore looks forward to Johnson recovering and says: “I think both Britain and Boris have a stronger constitution than Lord Kerslake allows.”
The Express, whose headline is “Boris moved to intensive care as health worsens”, highlights in one of its stories a comment by BBC journalist Andrew Neil who posted on Twitter a statistic about the dangers of the virus if you have not recovered after 10 days. The BBC host wrote: “This virus either gives up and you recover with no damage done or it really decides to go for you and you have a 50:50 chance. The PM’s decision to work through his isolation will not have helped. Nor loneliness in Downing St.” Finally, the Financial Times says “Johnson moved to intensive care as persistent symptoms worsen”."
2020-04-07T04:10:53Z,politics,Politics,Global leaders send messages of support to Boris Johnson,"Messages wishing Boris Johnson a speedy recovery after he was admitted to intensive care have been pouring in, with politicians across the world sending best wishes to the prime minister, his family and the British people. Johnson’s predecessors as prime minister, David Cameron and Theresa May, both sent messages of support, while Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, who is himself recovering from the virus, said his “thoughts are with you and your family”. As several of Johnson’s colleagues expressed sadness and shock at the news, messages flooded in from across the political divide. Donald Trump, appearing before the press, said he was praying for his “good friend”, after Johnson was moved to the intensive care unit of St Thomas’ hospital. The US president added that he had asked pharmaceutical companies to contact London regarding Johnson to “see if we can be of help”. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian leader whose wife was one of the first personalities connected to a world leader to contract the virus, also sent a message of support, saying he hoped to see Johnson back at No 10 soon.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said all his wishes were with the prime minister, his family and the people of Britain in “this difficult time” and he hoped Johnson would “quickly overcome” this ordeal.
Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, tweeted: “Boris Johnson is in our thoughts tonight. We wish him a speedy recovery and a rapid return to health,” while the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said: “The people of Israel pray for the speedy and full recovery of our friend.”Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, also sent best wishes, as did political rivals at home including Nicola Sturgeon, Jeremy Corbyn and the new Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who said the prime minister’s transfer to intensive care was “terribly sad news”. Italian president Giuseppe Conte tweeted: “My thoughts go to Boris Johnson and all the British people. I wish you a fast recovery. You have the whole Italian government’s support and my personal one.” Australian prime minister Scott Morrison tweeted: “Get well soon Boris Johnson. Thinking of you, your family and all our UK friends at this tough time.” From Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the People of Israel pray for the speedy and full recovery of our friend British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.”
Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, sent a tweet saying his thoughts and prayers were with Johnson. “To my dear friend Boris Johnson, my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family, as you fight for a swift recovery. The people of Japan stand with the British people at this difficult time.” Message of support also came in from the president of Ghana, the president of the European commission, and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. The Unite union leader, Len McCluskey, also sent his best wishes to the prime minister’s family, tweeting: “This is an agony that so many families across the country are going through.”"
2020-04-06T21:58:04Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Raab to lead UK through coronavirus hurdles,"With Boris Johnson in intensive care, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has been asked to step up “where necessary” and run the country during the biggest public health crisis in a generation. He will be expected from today to chair Cobra and cabinet meetings as the government makes crucial decisions related to the coronavirus, including whether and when to alter restrictions on movement. Raab, 46, who has twice tested negative for the virus, is Johnson’s “designated survivor”, taking on prime ministerial responsibilities now Johnson has become too ill to remain in charge of the government.
How long he remains in that position will depend on Johnson’s health and his prospects of returning to cabinet, according to a former senior civil servant. Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said: “The government and the cabinet secretary have clearly identified Raab as the first minister but that was done some time back without any notion that it would come to this. “Raab will step into the key functions such as chairing Cobra meetings and chairing cabinet. There will also have been general plans that would have been refined over the last few days since the prime minister’s illness became clear.” As the UK is a parliamentary democracy, there is no need, under the UK’s unwritten constitution, for an election in order for Raab to assume prime ministerial powers. However, political pressure could eventually lead to one. If the prime minister remains incapacitated for some time, questions will be raised about whether Raab has the authority to continue, Kerslake told the Guardian, and the cabinet may intervene. “The question will be to what extent can Raab carry the authority that Boris Johnson had, given that Boris led the government to a general election victory. I think a lot now depends on how quickly the PM recovers. “If he doesn’t recover quickly, the cabinet would take a view on who would be prime minister. But if the prime minister was unable to continue, the Conservative party may have to choose a new leader,” he said. “The challenge is that there are big questions to be made now. When and how do we leave the lockdown? Do we intensify it in the short term? Are we going to deliver the increased levels of testing and PPE [personal protection equipment] needed? Do we need to do more to protect those caught up in the economic fallout of the lockdown, such as the younger and the lower-paid?” Last month, the prime minister’s spokesman said if Johnson was unwell and unable to work, Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in. Downing Street is said to have drawn up plans to ensure the continuation of government in all circumstances but details have not been divulged publicly.
Ian Duncan Smith, the former Conservative party leader and a friend of the prime minister, said he had “all the confidence” in Raab as he was surrounded by cabinet ministers who knew the processes around the prime minister. He said contingencies for this situation were well planned. “In terms of the government we shouldn’t have any concerns at all. It has been known for some considerable time that the prime minister appointed Dominic Raab as first secretary. He is more than capable of fulfilling this role and he has great experience in government,” he told BBC News. “And he would have been brought up to speed on all the key processes that go around the prime minister since he became ill because they would have been planning for this and just in case this happened. “All the other cabinet ministers, some very senior like Michael Gove who understand how this works, they’ve all got important jobs to do … but what they will now have to do is look to Dominic Raab for that final principal decision making process whilst the prime minister is unable to take that role.”"
2020-04-06T21:22:12Z,politics,Politics,Ruffled Raab gives little clue of true state of prime minister's health | John Crace,"Just about the only reassuring thing to come out of the latest Downing Street press conference was that Dominic Raab does not yet have his hands on the nuclear button. Because in almost every other respect the foreign secretary appeared to be cosplaying Peter Sellers in Dr Strangelove. A man so clinically unstable he has yet to realise he is by far the most dangerous person in any room he enters. The pathology manifests itself in different ways. Often Raab is a ball of barely repressed anger, the vein on this forehead throbbing metronomically as he tries to front out any tricky questions. Today, he was going for the more laid-back approach – the Mr Nice Guy who definitely had no guilty secrets. Unfortunately for him, he had more to hide than the usual collection of unsolved murders. Sooner or later, someone is going to have to have a quiet word with Dom and tell him he’s crap at this gig. Then so is almost everyone else in the cabinet. To be fair, Dom had been dealt a particularly bad hand. After the usual disclaimers about the government having done a generally brilliant job so far, the foreign secretary was rather obliged to give an update on the prime minister’s health. Something he tried to mumble away as an afterthought. Boris Johnson was in top form, excellent spirits. In fact, he was having such a good time running the country from his bed in St Thomas’ hospital that he was planning to extend his stay to an extra night.
There was basically nothing wrong with Boris, was the message. He’d just dropped in to hospital because he was getting a bit bored at home. Understandably, no one was particularly convinced by Raab’s “He’s in good spirits” explanation of the prime minister’s health. After all, most people who have had even a mild version of the coronavirus have reported they were whacked out for the best part of a week and good for next to nothing. Yet here was Raab trying to persuade us that despite having a high temperature, a cough and breathing difficulties, Johnson was on top form and fit for anything. Being prime minister was actually a piece of piss that anyone could do from hospital. No big deal. “He’s in good spirits,” Raab again repeated, his eyes darting anxiously around the room. Mr Cool was now looking decidedly ruffled and he inadvertently let slip the truth. The last time he had actually spoken to the prime minister was on Saturday, the day before Boris was admitted to hospital. So we were asked to accept that for the last two days he had been entirely out of the loop and that Boris had been running the show on his own. Not necessarily bad news for the country, but badly credible. There was only one inescapable conclusion. That Boris doesn’t rate either Raab or Michael Gove as suitable deputies to run the country in his absence and reckons that he could probably still do a better job than either of them from his hospital bed. It’s a lack of trust with which most of the country has some sympathy. Occasionally, Raab would desperately look to the newly recovered chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the Foreign Office deputy chief medical adviser, Angela McLean, for reassurance. Which they both refused to give. Though the nation was pleased to see him back, Whitty rather looked as if he would be elsewhere. Probably visiting his second home, like the Scottish chief medical officer. That way he would have to resign and wouldn’t have to put himself through any more of these excruciating press conferences. Long before the end, Raab had managed to muddle up even the most basic of messages. Last week, both Boris and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had offered a glimmer of hope with a lockdown exit strategy, involving arm bands and antibody test. All that was now long forgotten as Dom pointed to some slides that showed it was far too early to be making any of those kinds of predictions. We were going backwards fast. A consistent display in hopelessness by the hopeless. A briefing that had only served to muddy the waters further: the Queen’s call for national unity a distant memory. For what came through clearest was that no one in government really had a clue what was happening. Even the de facto prime minister wasn’t being informed about the prime minister’s condition. Within hours the mirage had dropped. The press conference a total irrelevance. What Dom had or hadn’t known was immaterial. During the afternoon Boris’s condition had worsened and he was being transferred to intensive care. Dom was now acting prime minister. All that anyone could do now was put their trust in the doctors and pray for the best. The crisis had just got significantly worse."
2020-04-06T21:19:07Z,politics,Politics,PM's move to ICU shows he's likely to have severe Covid-19,"Boris Johnson’s move to the intensive care unit (ICU) of St Thomas’ hospital signals that he has severe Covid-19. Oxygen was available through a mask on the ward he was admitted to on Sunday, but the move to intensive care on Monday strongly suggests that was not enough to help him with the breathing problems caused by the viral pneumonia that the virus triggers. Most people in intensive care, according to the World Health Organization, require ventilation. Around 15% of people with Covid-19 become seriously ill and need oxygen therapy in hospital. A further 5% are moved into intensive care, so that their breathing can be taken over by mechanical ventilation. Some will also need support for other organs. Anyone who is put on a ventilator will need to be sedated, although they are not unconscious. A tube must be inserted into the patient’s windpipe, so that air and oxygen from the machine can be blown into the lungs. That takes the strain off the lungs while they recover. Johnson, 55, is said to have been admitted to intensive care in case he should need ventilation, but 63% of those admitted to ICUs in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are ventilated within the first 24 hours. Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) say that critical care treatment for Covid-19 should be started “with a clear plan of how the treatment will address the diagnosis and lead to agreed treatment goals (outcomes)”. Ventilation is vital in most severe Covid-19 cases, which is why there has been a huge effort to obtain more machines and even encourage engineering businesses to switch production lines to make them. In the severest cases, patients are put on an ECMO machine (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), which can support both the heart and lungs where somebody is in a life-threatening condition. Johnson’s admission to intensive care comes shortly after the 10th day of the illness, which has been identified as a real danger point. During the first week, most people’s immune systems rally and manage to fight off the virus. Those who do not recover and continue to struggle for breath and have a fever often need help around the middle of the second week. In that second week, the immune system can sometimes go into overdrive. In its attempt to fight the virus, it creates what is called a cytokine storm, in which the immune system attacks the body’s own organs. The heart, the liver and kidneys are most likely to be affected and all of them can need to be supported by machines that can take over their function. The latest report into patients admitted into critical care so far from the intensive care national audit and research centre (IANARC), showed 2,621 admissions up to 3 April, most of whom are still there. The mean age was 60 and 73% of them were men. More than 35% of them were overweight, with a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 30, and 37% were obese. Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging at University College London, said: “It seems clear that the prime minister went to hospital because he had difficulty breathing. It seems he was initially put on oxygen, and was conscious. “But as often happens with Covid-19, his condition has now deteriorated so he has been admitted to intensive care. “We understand the PM is on a type of breathing support called Continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap), which is commonly used in treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea. Experience in Italy and other European countries has shown that Cpap can be effective in Covid-19 patients, at least initially. Many Covid-19 patients progress to invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilation involves a tube being put down the patient’s airway.”"
2020-04-06T17:07:09Z,politics,Politics,Hospital admission puts new focus on Boris Johnson's health,"The news that Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital for tests on Sunday night with persistent coronavirus symptoms has shone a spotlight on the prime minister’s health. While Johnson is not known to have any underlying health conditions, he has been open about his struggle with obesity – a known risk factor for coronavirus. According to a report published last week, more than 70% of patients placed in intensive care after being infected with Covid-19 were overweight, obese or severely obese on the body mass index scale. In December 2018, when Johnson was foreign secretary, he said in the Spectator that he weighed 16 and a half stone, which at 5ft 9in would have put him in the obese category. Johnson has lost weight since then, but it has fluctuated significantly throughout his political career. Sonia Purnell, author of Just Boris: A Tale of Blond Ambition, said that the prime minister’s usual wellbeing was striking. “By and large, he is remarkably fit considering he is actually a bit overweight,” she said. “He’s not really that active, his runs aren’t very long or very energetic and he is very fond of cheese. In fact, he likes eating a lot – nothing wrong with that – but he does have a very robust constitution. In the time I’ve known him since the 90s, illness has never really come up.” Johnson became a devoted runner in the early 2000s. In his book Boris: The Rise of Boris Johnson, Andrew Gimson notes the prime minister also took up cycling in London in 1999 and quickly became “the most famous cyclist in Britain”. Gimson added that cycling had several attractions for Boris: “It was energetic, dangerous, anarchic.” While he was mayor of London, Johnson was involved in several near-miss accidents while cycling, including a 2009 incident in east London. In 2013, Johnson went on a major health kick before taking part in the first Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100, a now annual closed-roads cycle ride out of the capital and into the countryside. At the start of his training regime, which he styled Operation Chiselled Whippet, Johnson, who was then 48, conceded that he was “pushing 17 stone, and since my normal cycling speed is so slow that my wife says it is a miracle I stay upright, I have decided to get in shape”. When Theresa May made him foreign secretary in 2016, Johnson lamented the impact the job had on his lifestyle. While he was back on his bike after returning to the backbench, his cycling days were limited, as he would soon be entering No 10. As well as jogging and cycling, Johnsonis a keen tennis player. At an auction for the Conservative party’s annual winter ball, a game of tennis with the prime minister was auctioned for £45,000. Purnell traces Johnson’s appetite for sport to his childhood, when he was encouraged to run, jump, and play “whiff-whaff”, better known as table tennis. At Eton, he played rugby and cricket, and took part in the Wall Game, a sport unique to the private school. More recently, Johnson is reported to have given up his running due to issues with his knees. The prime minister instead participates in online classes that include yoga and pilates. Purnell says the hospital admission will be difficult for Johnson who, like his father, rarely admits to illness or notices it in others. “When I worked with him as his deputy [in the Daily Telegraph’s Brussels bureau], he was certainly very, very intolerant of illness in others, and considered it as sort of a weakness.” Additional reporting by Peter Walker"
2020-04-06T14:22:58Z,politics,Politics,Ed Miliband returns to Labour frontbench in Keir Starmer reshuffle,"Ed Miliband is returning to frontline politics as Labour’s shadow business, energy and industry secretary, the party announced on Monday, as the new leader, Keir Starmer, completed his shadow cabinet. As well as the return of the former leader, David Lammy, the MP for Tottenham who has campaigned for justice for the Windrush victims, has been promoted to shadow justice secretary. Lord Falconer, the former solicitor general who was closely associated with Tony Blair’s government, will return to the shadow cabinet as shadow attorney general. The newly announced cabinet is majority female, with seven BAME MPs included. A quarter of appointees attended fee-paying schools, with just under a third Oxbridge graduates. Miliband, who was the energy secretary under Gordon Brown and led the party from 2010 until the 2015 general election, said in a statement that he looked forward to playing a part in the country’s response to the coronavirus crisis. “As Keir has said, we cannot go back to business as usual after this crisis,” he said.
“We will need to reshape our economy, addressing the insecurity many millions of workers face. We must also return to climate change as the unavoidable long-term issue of our time.” The appointments of Miliband and Falconer to the shadow cabinet signal the ascent of the soft left in the party, at the expense of the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting hard left who have dominated since 2015. Starmer’s victory on Sunday was emphatic, with him winning 56.2% of the members’ and affiliates’ votes, having already won a majority of votes among the Parliamentary Labour party. Starmer’s allies have insisted there will be no “purge” of the left but add that there will be a marked shift in tone. “We will be putting the country first, and we will be presenting ourselves as an alternative government. We are not seeking ideological purity,” said one. Rebecca Long-Bailey, who came second behind Starmer in the contest to become leader, has been given a job as shadow education secretary. She is one of few outright supporters of Corbyn who have survived a cull of the last cabinet. Andy McDonald, another Corbyn ally, has been made shadow employment rights and protections secretary. Among those from the left of the party who were ousted were Diane Abbott, Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler, Barry Gardiner, Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett. All will now return to the backbenches. Another defeated leadership candidate, Emily Thornberry, will return as shadow international trade secretary. The newly announced shadow cabinet is majority female, with 17 women and 15 men. There are seven BAME shadow cabinet members, including Lisa Nandy, Lammy and Marsha de Cordova, the new shadow women and equalities secretary.
John Healey, who covered the housing brief under Corbyn, will be the party’s new defence spokesman – a tricky brief in a party torn between supporting nuclear disarmament and pressure from unions to sustain jobs in the defence sector. Those new to the shadow cabinet include: Bridget Phillipson, the member for Houghton and Sunderland South and a critic of Corbyn, who will be the shadow chief secretary to the treasury; the Birmingham Edgbaston MP Preet Kaur Gill, who will shadow the international development brief; and Thangam Debbonaire, a former whip under Corbyn who will now be the shadow housing secretary. Louise Haigh, the campaigning former policing minister who organised Nandy’s campaign, has been made interim shadow Northern Ireland secretary. Tony Lloyd, the incumbent, has been hospitalised with the coronavirus, it emerged on Monday. On Sunday, Starmer surprised many when he made Nandy, another candidate he defeated to become Labour leader, his shadow foreign secretary. Anneliese Dodds, who became an MP only in 2017, was promoted to become shadow chancellor. Nick Thomas-Symonds, a barrister, takes over from Abbott as shadow home secretary. There was a return to the shadow cabinet for Rachel Reeves, the Leeds West MP who was shadow work and pensions minister under Miliband. She was made shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. As widely predicted, Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, will remain in his job. Constituencies in the north-west and London are equally represented, with 19% of the shadow cabinet representing a seat in one of these two regions, while 12.5% of Starmer’s cabinet represent Yorkshire and the Humber. At 49, the average age of Starmer’s cabinet is slightly older than Boris Johnson’s cabinet (48). More than half of the shadow cabinet were born in the 1970s and 80s. Three quarters of the new shadow cabinet attended a state school, with 20 MPs attending comprehensives and four attending a grammar. A further five went to a fee-paying school, including Dodds. Nine members of the shadow cabinet studied at Oxford or Cambridge, just under a third of the total. All but three were university graduates. Commenting on the new team, Starmer said: “I’m proud to have appointed a shadow cabinet that showcases the breadth, depth and talents of the Labour party. “This is a new team that will be relentlessly focused on acting in the national interest to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and rebuilding Labour so that it can win the next election.” The shadow cabinet in full • Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition. • Angela Rayner, deputy leader and chair of the Labour party. • Anneliese Dodds, shadow chancellor of the exchequer. • Lisa Nandy, shadow foreign secretary. • Nick Thomas-Symonds, shadow home secretary. • Rachel Reeves, shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. • David Lammy, shadow justice secretary. • John Healey, shadow defence secretary. • Ed Miliband, shadow business, energy and industrial secretary. • Emily Thornberry, shadow international trade secretary. • Jonathan Reynolds, shadow work and pensions secretary. • Jonathan Ashworth, shadow secretary of state for health and social care. • Rebecca Long-Bailey, shadow education secretary. • Jo Stevens, shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary. • Bridget Phillipson, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. • Luke Pollard, shadow environment, food and rural affairs secretary. • Steve Reed, shadow communities and local government secretary. • Thangam Debbonaire, shadow housing secretary. • Jim McMahon, shadow transport secretary. • Preet Kaur Gill, shadow international development secretary. • Louise Haigh, shadow Northern Ireland secretary (interim while Tony Lloyd is in hospital being treated for coronavirus). • Ian Murray, shadow Scotland secretary. • Nia Griffith, shadow Wales secretary. • Marsha de Cordova, shadow women and equalities secretary. • Andy McDonald, shadow employment rights and protections secretary. • Rosena Allin-Khan, shadow minister for mental health. • Cat Smith, shadow minister for young people and voter engagement. • Lord Falconer, shadow attorney general. • Valerie Vaz, shadow leader of the house. • Nick Brown, opposition chief whip. • Lady Smith, shadow leader of the Lords. • Lord McAvoy, Lords’ Opposition chief whip.

2020-04-06T14:17:49Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson is latest PM to face ill health during a national crisis,"Prime ministers do not aspire to infallibility or immortality, but a display of mental or physical frailty at a point of national crisis is something any Downing Street spin doctor would dearly wish to avoid, and if possible suppress. The impression of the ship of state adrift, and the helmsman heading below deck, pleading illness, hardly inspires confidence, however much personal sympathy in this case is felt towards Boris Johnson. With questions being asked about the government’s lockdown exit strategy and Labour revitalised by a new leader seeking to make a mark, No 10 needs to be at its most coherent and decisive. It is also a concern if Johnson as adjudicator is absent just as Whitehall jostling starts between those putting either the interests of the nation’s health or its economy first. But the infectiousness of this virus made it practically impossible for Johnson to hide from others in No 10, and the public, that he had contracted it. Once the decision was made for Johnson to go to hospital, No 10 went public within two hours. Little other option was available. Rumours had been circulating for days that his recovery was not under way, highlighted by the return of the health secretary, Matt Hancock.
One person closely involved said: “The difficulty is that the crisis is so all-enveloping, the PM could not stop working. No one likes to think they are dispensable. The first step was to get him to admit to himself how ill he was becoming. What was subsequently admitted to the nation was a second order issue”. Even now No 10 is reluctant to go into detail on the prime minister’s health, stressing in its statement that the hospital admission was simply a precautionary step to undertake tests, rather than an acknowledgement that he had deteriorated. He would continue to be briefed at his hospital bed and was very much in charge.
By contrast, Donald Trump in opening his Sunday press conference provided a dramatic, possibly melodramatic, medical bulletin on Johnson’s health, offering the US’s prayers to help Johnson in “his personal fight with the virus”. Trump has a relationship with the truth that could be described as sometimes adjacent, but he did not give the impression that Johnson was going to hospital for routine tests. If No 10 is being economical about a more serious illness, it would not be the first time the public has been misled by a serving prime minister about his health. The UK may be at war with an invisible virus, but British prime ministers at times of conflict have always been reluctant to admit they have been incapacitated. David Lloyd George in 1918 suffered a bout of influenza so severe his valet said it was touch and go whether he would survive. Medical bulletins at the time made no suggestion he was in any danger. Andrew Bonar Law resigned in 1923 only on receiving a diagnosis of terminal throat cancer, and Henry Campbell-Bannerman, prime minister from 1905 to 1908, died days after his resignation in 10 Downing Street. During Winston Churchill’s two wartime illnesses, the full extent of them was never revealed. In February 1943, after the then 69-year-old contracted pneumonia, his personal physician Charles Wilson drafted a bulletin, but Churchill immediately demanded to see it. He dismissed it as “alarmist” and liable to cause confusion and despondency and was, in any case, untrue. Churchill, therefore, dictated his own bulletin, but Wilson said it was inaccurate and misleading and he could not possibly sign it. Elaborate textual negotiations led to a compromise, and subsequent bulletins always referred to his improving condition. A further bout of pneumonia in August 1944 was not publicised at all, and according to his wife, Clementine, only the smallest circle was informed. Similarly, the cocktail of drugs being taken by Anthony Eden during the Suez crisis was known only to a few, and even now the impact on his judgment is a matter of dispute. But these were more discreet times, and the ruling class could form a small circle of trust. That in turn made it easier to put out bland medical bulletins that disguised more than they revealed. The White House has been equally skilled at suppressing the truth about its president’s health. Franklin D Roosevelt famously had polio, Dwight D Eisenhower had both a heart attack and a stroke while in office. John F Kennedy suffered Addison’s disease, hypothyroidism and severe back pain, none of which was publicly disclosed during his lifetime. Grover Cleveland in 1893 even had a secret operation to remove a cancerous growth that took place on a boat, dressed up as a fishing trip on a lake. The fear that power, credibility and respect will seep away if ill health is revealed remains. Not just the electorate will lose faith, but your cabinet colleagues may sniff a succession. Tony Blair was reluctant to reveal his heart issues for fear allies of the the then chancellor, Gordon Brown, might take advantage. Hillary Clinton was hammered when she contracted pneumonia, and wobbled in front of the TV cameras when walking to a car. In 2016 news of her illness received 13 times more coverage than revelations about fraud in Trump’s charitable foundation. Bernie Sanders has frantically denied his heart attack makes him the weaker of the three septuagenarians seeking the presidency. But outright suppression of the truth in modern politics has its downsides. Figures such as Peter Mandelson, Gordon Brown’s chief communicator after the financial crash, have warned the prerequisite for national unity at a time of genuine crisis is a government that levels with the British public about the difficulties the Whitehall machine is facing. There will come a point when, if Johnson’s condition is serious, the medical and spin doctors will have to tell the public as much."
2020-04-06T12:26:25Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson remains in hospital after 'comfortable night',"Boris Johnson is still in hospital suffering from coronavirus and had a “comfortable night” but No 10 has dropped the description of his symptoms as mild. As the prime minister continues to be observed by doctors, Downing Street said it was too early to say whether he would be staying for another night and did not deny that he had been given oxygen treatment. The prime minister’s official spokesman said he was in St Thomas’ hospital in south London and was in “good spirits”, while continuing to work on his red box of government papers. Asked whether Johnson had pneumonia, the spokesman said any change in his condition would be communicated to the public. He still has a cough and a temperature, more than 11 days after first reporting symptoms. No 10 insisted it had been “transparent throughout” Johnson’s illness, despite having described the prime minister’s symptoms as mild right up until his hospital admission. Johnson himself only admitted to still having a temperature, not a cough, in his video message on Friday morning. No 10 has now changed its description of his symptoms to “persistent”. Two Tory ministers – Nadine Dorries and James Duddridge – have suggested Johnson needs to rest. However, No 10 said he was taking advice from his doctors on whether it was safe for him to continue working and was still in touch with No 10 officials from his hospital bed. Earlier, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, insisted Johnson was fit enough to lead the country from his hospital bed after he was admitted with persistent coronavirus symptoms.
Johnson was admitted on Sunday evening with a high fever on the advice of his doctor, with Downing Street saying he was undergoing routine tests. He was kept in overnight. Most coronavirus patients stay in hospital for more than a week. However, Jenrick told BBC Breakfast: “We all hope and expect that he can get back to No 10 very soon.” If his condition worsens, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is the designated minister to take charge. Raab chaired a Monday morning meeting of the government’s C-19 committee, which is leading the response to the pandemic. However, Tuesday’s cabinet meeting has been cancelled. The pound fell against the dollar and euro overnight on Monday as foreign exchange markets took fright at the possibility of Johnson being out of action. The prime minister had been hoping to leave quarantine on Friday but his persistent temperature meant he had to remain inside his flat at No 11 Downing Street. The Guardian was told last week that Johnson was more seriously ill than either he or his officials were prepared to admit, and that he was being seen by doctors who were concerned about his breathing.
But Downing Street flatly denied the prime minister’s health had seriously deteriorated, and insisted there were no plans at that point for him to be admitted to hospital. Asked if it was time for colleagues in the cabinet and civil service to tell Johnson to rest, Jenrick told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “He has worked phenomenally hard, as have many people across the country. This has been a uniquely intense period and I know for him personally it will be very frustrating that he has had to go to hospital to have these tests. “He will want to be back in No 10 leading from the front, which is his way. But he remains in charge of the government; he will be updated regularly in hospital, as he has been as he’s self-isolating.” On Sunday, Matt Hancock was asked just how ill the prime minister was. The health secretary told Sophy Ridge on Sky News: “He’s OK. I’ve been talking to him every day, several times a day … he’s very much got his hand on the tiller. But he’s still got a temperature.” Johnson’s partner, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, revealed on Saturday that she had also contracted the virus but was recovering.
While No 10 did not say what tests Johnson would have in hospital, experts said they would be likely to focus on assessing how the prime minister’s lungs, heart and other organs were responding to the virus. “Doctors will be monitoring important vital signs such as oxygen saturations,” said Dr Rupert Beale, who heads the cell biology of infection laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London. “They will also check blood tests to see what the immune response to the virus looks like, and to assess liver and kidney function. They will perform an electrocardiogram to check the heart. More sophisticated tests may include a CT scan of the chest to get an accurate picture of the lungs.”
With Johnson in hospital, the ministers involved in the government’s coronavirus response will be looking ahead to next weekend, which is the point at which it will have to extend or end the lockdown. Jenrick signalled the lockdown was unlikely to be lifted at the end of the week, saying some of the most challenging weeks were probably still to come. As communities secretary, he said the government “desperately” did not want to shut parks but it could happen if people continued to congregate for picnics. Critics of the government are concerned that ministers have not identified a way out of the lockdown, with doubts about its ability to scale up testing for live cases and the efficacy of new antibody tests to find out whether people have had the virus. The former prime minister Tony Blair called for a senior minister to “take charge of testing, and nothing else, with people with business experience of how you ramp up industrial scale production”. He said it was not the right choice for an epidemiologist to be in charge of this effort, after the government put Prof John Newton of Public Health England in charge. “Unless you are able to get mass testing at scale, with speed, I don’t see how you can get a way out of this lockdown and I am terrified by the economic damage we are doing with every week this lockdown continues,” Blair told the Today programme. “This damage is enormous … If it goes on for a long time then it doesn’t just affect the economy per se, it also affects the ability to operate your healthcare service effectively.” His comments echo the calls of the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has for more than a week advocated a return to mass community testing to suppress virus hotspots where they arise."
2020-04-06T10:31:08Z,politics,Politics,"Shadow chancellor TV interview gatecrashed by her daughter, three","Many parents working from home during the national lockdown have grown accustomed to their children interrupting virtual work meetings, but most don’t have it happen during a live news interview. Anneliese Dodds, the newly appointed shadow chancellor, was interrupted by her daughter while speaking to Kay Burley on Sky News on Monday morning.
Dodds, who was given the shadow cabinet role by the new Labour leader, Keir Starmer, on Sunday, had been discussing the economic impact of the coronavirus lockdown when her three-year-old daughter, Isabella, strolled in. She said: “We need to get to the best possible situation for dealing with the virus and then ensuring we have that economic support there for businesses and individuals that they need at this time.” As Isabella walked through the door to the room and stood next to her mother, Burley said: “Somebody wants to come and say hello to you while you’re on the telly. We’ve seen this before haven’t we … she’s welcome any time on the programme.” “I thought she was going to stay asleep, sorry … so embarrassing,” Dodds said, when asked about the moment at the interview’s close. “She’s thankfully under the chair now.” The clip is reminiscent of the viral TV moment when Prof Robert Kelly’s two small children interrupted his comments on South Korean politics during a live BBC News interview. The clip has since been watched more than 37m times on the broadcaster’s YouTube channel. Dodds is the MP for Oxford East. She and her partner, Ed Turner, also have a six-year-old, Freddie, according to a Facebook post she created after last December’s general election. While speaking on ITV’s Good Morning Britain during another remote interview on Monday, Dodds said it was critical that the government began working on a way out of the economic shutdown immediately.
“I think it’s critical that the government look at that economic exit strategy now because it will take some time to plan. I really hope also they will be working closely with other countries on this because we will need to have a global boost,” she said. Dodds said she would speak to her counterpart in government, Rishi Sunak, later on Monday as she stressed the importance of working with the Conservatives during the pandemic."
2020-04-05T20:32:13Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson admitted to hospital with coronavirus,"Boris Johnson has been admitted to hospital due to coronavirus after suffering 10 days of symptoms including a high fever, bringing doubts about his capability to lead the response to the pandemic despite No 10 insisting it was purely precautionary. Johnson was taken to an unnamed London hospital on Sunday after days of persistent symptoms, during which time he has been self-isolating. Last week No 10 had denied the prime minister was more seriously ill than claimed. A Downing Street spokesperson said: “On the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests. This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus.” The spokesperson said Johnson would stay in hospital “as long as needed”. Officials were keen to stress that this was not an emergency admission, and that Johnson will remain in charge of government, and will be in regular touch with colleagues and civil servants. A government source told Reuters on Monday morning that Johnson had spent the night in hospital. If his condition worsens Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is the designated minister to take charge. Raab is expected to chair a 9.15am Monday meeting of the government’s C-19 committee, which leads the response to the pandemic. The pound fell against the dollar and euro overnight on Monday as foreign exchange markets took fright at the possibility of Johnson being out of action.
Johnson had been hoping to leave quarantine on Friday but his persistent temperature meant he had to remain inside his flat at No 11 Downing Street. The Guardian was told last week that Johnson was more seriously ill than either he or his officials were prepared to admit, and that he was being seen by doctors who were concerned about his breathing.

I’ve been talking to him every day, several times a day … he’s very much got his hand on the tiller. But he’s still got a temperature.” He added: “He’s working away inside Downing Street. He’s in good spirits.” Hancock himself has only recently come out of isolation after testing positive for coronavirus, although his symptoms appear to have been notably milder. Johnson’s partner, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, revealed on Saturday that she had also been suffering from the virus but is recovering. While No 10 did not say what tests Johnson would undergo in hospital, experts said they would be likely to focus on assessing how the prime minister’s lungs, heart and other organs were responding to the virus. “Doctors will be monitoring important vital signs such as oxygen saturations,” said Dr Rupert Beale, who heads the cell biology of infection laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute in London. “They will also check blood tests to see what the immune response to the virus looks like, and to assess liver and kidney function. They will perform an electrocardiogram to check the heart. More sophisticated tests may include a CT scan of the chest to get an accurate picture of the lungs.”
Keir Starmer, the new Labour leader, was among a string of MPs to tweet their best wishes to Johnson. “Wishing the prime minister well and a speedy recovery,” he wrote. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary and Johnson’s main rival for the Conservative leadership last year, tweeted: “Thoughts with Boris Johnson this evening. Whatever political persuasion the whole country is united in wanting our PM to get fit and well as soon as possible.” Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, tweeted: “Wishing the PM all the best and a speedy recovery.” Donald Trump, the US president, began his Sunday night press briefing by sending well wishes to Johnson. “He’s a great friend of mine,” Trump said of his British counterpart. “I’m sure he is going to be fine, he’s a strong man, a strong person.” Johnson’s hospitalisation came after the Department of Health said the number of hospital deaths connected to coronavirus stood at 4,934 people as of 5pm on Saturday, up by 621 from 4,313 the day before. Among recent fatalities was the first serving midwife confirmed to have died with coronavirus. Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow, Essex, said Lynsay Coventry, 54, had died on Thursday.
Also on Sunday, scientists warned that the 17.5m antibody home testing kits ordered by the government after Johnson said they could be a “game changer” might fail to detect up to half of coronavirus cases. It had been suggested the kits would be made available to the public within days, but on Sunday Hancock played down their imminent arrival. Scientists involved in validating home testing kits told the Guardian that no test on the market has yet been shown to be sufficiently reliable. One expert said they were more likely to detect only 50%-60% of those with milder symptoms. Also on Sunday: • Hancock criticised the “unbelievable” behaviour of people packing into parks on a warm day and warned rules on exercise could change, while saying this was not imminent. • Scotland’s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, resigned after it emerged she twice went to her second home during the lockdown. • Italy recorded its lowest number of cases in two weeks, with the total number of people in hospital with the virus falling for the first time since the beginning of the crisis. • It was announced the Marquess of Bath, the owner of Longleat safari park, had died after contracting coronavirus at age 87."
2020-04-05T17:25:24Z,politics,Politics,Three key appointments: Keir Starmer fills top shadow cabinet roles,"Anneliese Dodds – shadow chancellor Dodds is a relative newcomer to parliament, first winning her safe Oxford East seat in 2017, but before then had spent three years as an MEP, serving on the European parliament’s economic and monetary affairs committee, with a focus on corporate tax avoidance.
This background saw her become a shadow treasury minister within weeks of entering parliament, a role she has remained in ever since. She served under Jeremy Corbyn despite not being a natural ally of his side of the party, having backed Yvette Cooper in the 2015 Labour leadership contest. The 42-year-old was raised in Aberdeen, moving to England to pursue a degree at Oxford university in the politicians’ traditional subject of politics, philosophy and economics. She took a PhD and became an academic, focusing on public policy. Her partner, Ed Turner, is the Labour deputy leader of Oxford city council. The pair have two young children. Lisa Nandy – shadow foreign secretary The senior job for Nandy is a reward for the Wigan MP’s strong performance in the Labour leadership race, where she reached the final three who went before the members – even though she came third behind Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey, with just 16% of first-preference votes.
Nandy came across in the race as the candidate presenting Labour members with unpalatable truths about the need for the party to fundamentally change if it was ever to win another election. While always seen as an outsider, the former shadow energy secretary, who quit Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet following the Brexit vote, was seen as having performed well in media interviews and debates. A former charity officer who became the MP for her home town in 2010, Nandy used a speech on international affairs during the campaign to criticise Corbyn over his unwillingness to condemn Russia, and said Labour should have made positive, internationalist arguments against Brexit, including a defence of free movement. Nick Thomas-Symonds – shadow home secretary Another lawyer in Starmer’s top team, the 39-year-old barrister has represented the Welsh seat of Torfaen, where he was born, since 2015.
He took over from Jo Steven as shadow solicitor general in 2016, and the following year took on the additional role of shadow security minister in Diane Abbott’s home affairs team, where he has been a critic of the Prevent anti-extremism programme. Educated at Oxford, Thomas-Symonds became a lecturer in politics at his own college while just 21. He has since written biographies of Nye Bevan and Clement Attlee. Since becoming an MP, Symonds-Thomas has talked about Attlee as a role model, describing the postwar Labour prime minister as a leader able to unite a broad range of views within Labour. He lives in Abersychan with his wife and two daughters."
2020-04-05T17:12:26Z,politics,Politics,Who will lead us through these troubled times?,"Gaby Hinsliff is absolutely right to raise parallels with the 1914-16 Asquith war government and our own parlous situation under our current political leadership (Doctors and nurses are dying for lack of equipment. Is Johnson up to this?, 2 April). At that time, an intelligent but lazy prime minister with a complicated love life, renowned for deferring difficult decisions, was accused by the press and sections of his own party – as well opposition politicians – of inaction and drift. It seemed obvious that a collective national action plan, involving all sectors of industry and the body politic, was urgently needed if the country were to avoid a national catastrophe. Comparisons with Germany’s far better state of preparedness were added to charges of incompetence levelled at the prime minister at that time of national crisis. Unfortunately, today we seem to lack a Lloyd George – a man of energy and wide popularity, commanding the respect of all sides of the house and the country, and seen by friend and foe alike as the only man with the necessary will and gravitas, as well as a brutal willingness to abandon a former friend and colleague, to lead us through these dark times. Unless, of course, the present chancellor of the exchequer, like his predecessor Lloyd George, at some point decides there is no alternative but to knife his friend the PM in the back. To emulate Lloyd George, Rishi Sunak would need to get the new leader of the opposition on board and, preferably, sitting with him in a new government of national unity. That prospect might seem improbable now but, as this crisis unfolds, who knows? Stranger things have happened. Greg Delaney Chiswick, London • I quote from Lytton Strachey’s Eminent Victorians (1918), on what greeted Florence Nightingale at Scutari. “What had occurred was, in brief, the complete breakdown of our medical arrangements at the seat of war. The origins of this awful failure were complex and manifold; they stretched back through long years of peace and carelessness in England; they could be traced through endless ramifications of administrative incapacity – from the inherent faults of confused systems, to the petty bunglings of minor officials, from the inevitable ignorance of Cabinet Ministers to the fatal exactitudes of narrow routine.” I notice Sir Keir Starmer has chosen his words carefully in saying he will work with Boris Johnson; this does not imply unconditional support.

2020-04-05T16:19:09Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer gives Lisa Nandy foreign brief on new Labour frontbench,"Keir Starmer has made Lisa Nandy, one of the candidates he defeated to become Labour leader, his shadow foreign secretary, and Anneliese Dodds, who became an MP only in 2017, his shadow chancellor. Speaking before the first tranche of top appointments, the new Labour leader promised he would create a shadow cabinet balanced between the various wings of the party. However, MPs still loyal to Jeremy Corbyn will note there was no immediate role for Rebecca Long-Bailey, the former leader’s perceived favourite in the leadership race, and no senior job yet for other figures associated with his camp. Starmer’s top team was completed by Nick Thomas-Symonds, a barrister, who takes over from Diane Abbott as shadow home secretary. Thomas-Symonds, the MP for the Welsh seat of Torfaen since 2015, was previously a security minister in the shadow home affairs team. Dodds, the Oxford East MP, is a former MEP and has spent nearly three years as a shadow Treasury minister. Among the other appointments, Angela Rayner, the newly elected deputy leader, was also made the Labour party chair. There was a return to the shadow cabinet for Rachel Reeves, the Leeds West MP who was shadow work and pensions minister under Ed Miliband but who spent the entire Corbyn period on the backbenches. She was made shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Jonathan Ashworth remains in the health brief, as was widely expected given the coronavirus pandemic, with Nick Brown staying as chief whip and Angela Smith as shadow Lords leader. Barry Gardiner, Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery were confirmed as having left the shadow cabinet, having served as shadow international trade secretary, shadow Cabinet Office minister and party chair respectively. Trickett tweeted to say Starmer had “politely asked me to stand down”. Emily Thornberry, previously shadow foreign secretary, will stay in the shadow cabinet in a new position to be announced on Monday. Nandy’s elevation was the one surprise amid the most senior appointments, with a series of newspapers having tipped the Cardiff MP Jo Stevens as being lined up for the post. While Nandy, the MP for Wigan since 2010, came a third in the leadership race, she emerged during the campaign as a leading voice in promoting Labour efforts to reconnect with voters in struggling towns in the north and Midlands. Nandy’s mantra during the campaign was that Labour must “change or die”. On foreign affairs she was critical of what she said was the disinclination of Corbyn and his team to criticise Russia, and she called for a more positive defence of international values. In a tweet following the news, Nandy wrote: “It’s a real honour to be tasked with leading Labour’s foreign policy response in these difficult times.” Starmer said that under his leadership the priority would be to “act in the country’s interest to save lives and protect livelihoods” during the coronavirus pandemic. “We will be a responsible opposition that supports the government where we believe they are right and challenge them when we believe mistakes are being made,” he said. Asked about his plans earlier in the day, Starmer told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show that his shadow cabinet would be “balanced across the party, it will be balanced across the country – and of course it will be balanced in terms of diversity”. Asked if he would include some Blairites in his frontbench team, Starmer said he wanted to move on from such labels. “I will have in my shadow cabinet those that want to serve towards the future aim of winning that next general election. It’ll be a talented, balanced shadow cabinet,” he said. “We’re not looking back, we’re not badging people by the past. We’re going forward to the future, focusing on how we win the 2024 general election.” In his first media interview since winning the leadership, Starmer sought to stress party unity but made it plain he believed that Labour needed significant change. “We just lost four elections in a row and therefore of course we need to change. If we don’t change we will lose the next general election.” Playing down the idea of some form of national unity government, Starmer pledged to work constructively with the government over the response to coronavirus while asking “difficult questions” when needed. But he stressed the need for an equitable economic settlement once the crisis was over, saying there would be a need for richer people and corporations to pay more tax, rather than a return to austerity. “What we can’t do is go back to business as usual,” he said. “We now know who the key workers really are, and they very often have been overlooked and underpaid, and there has got to be a change. They were last and now they’ve got to be first.”"
2020-04-05T14:55:37Z,politics,Politics,Ministers and NHS deny reports of rift over coronavirus response,"Ministers and the NHS have pushed back strongly against a series of reports alleging splits within the government and between ministers and health bosses over the response to coronavirus, insisting talk of tensions is wildly overblown. Following claims of disagreements between the Department of Health and Social Care and both NHS England and Public Health England (PHE) over difficulties in rolling out more tests for the virus, the health service took the unusual step of calling the reports “factually wrong”. Meanwhile, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, dismissed the idea that he and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, had disagreed over when to end the lockdown. The reports capped a difficult week for the government after criticism over the slow pace of testing and the provision of protective equipment for NHS and care staff.
The nadir came on Wednesday when a stumbling performance by Alok Sharma, the business secretary, prompted even some loyal newspapers to lead their next day’s editions with talk of chaos. The following day Hancock emerged from seven days of isolation because of coronavirus symptoms to pledge that 100,000 tests a day would be carried out by the end of the month, a target he conceded on Sunday would be hard to achieve. In a story alleging widespread splits within government and between ministers and various agencies, the Sunday Times said ministers were blaming NHS England and PHE over the delays in supplying protective equipment and for taking an over-centralist, controlling attitude towards private laboratories helping with tests. NHS bosses are believed to be particularly annoyed at the claim they are unwilling to work with the private sector, pointing to a deal made last month to work with private hospitals to share the burden. An NHS England spokesman said the claims were “factually wrong”, saying NHS hospital labs had done the testing they had been asked to do, focused on patients and staff, and that mass testing would always have needed outside help.
NHS England “has itself rapidly engaged with the private sector in areas for which it has responsibility, as evidenced by a deal to redeploy almost all independent hospitals across England to help with the expected surge of coronavirus patients”, the spokesman said. “This means another 20,000 staff, 8,000 more beds and an extra 1,000 ventilators can all be used in this battle.” They added: “The NHS in partnership with the military has acted in record time to establish new Nightingale hospitals in London and now in four other regions across the country. Everyone across the NHS is completely focused on coming together to respond to the biggest global health emergency in a century.”
A separate report in the Mail on Sunday said Sunak had made “robust” arguments to Hancock about the economic need for a relatively swift return to normality, with unnamed critics telling the paper that the health secretary had misjudged the balance between the NHS coping with coronavirus and the wider needs of the economy. Asked on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show whether he had fallen out with the new chancellor, Hancock said: “No, we’re working very closely together and what matters is that we can get out of this as fast as possible.” Hancock added: “I think that Rishi is doing an absolutely brilliant job as chancellor, the measures that he’s put in place to support businesses, to support people, self-employed people and employed people are absolutely phenomenal, and in fact he has been lauded around the world for the first-class economic response we have got in this country.”"
2020-04-05T11:05:05Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer promises to name balanced shadow cabinet,"Keir Starmer has promised that the new shadow cabinet he is due to start naming on Sunday will be balanced between various wings of the party, while urging an end to factional fighting and the use of labels such as Blairite. A day after winning the contest to succeed Jeremy Corbyn, Starmer also said Labour must prepare to help reshape a very different political world after the coronavirus pandemic. His camp was expected to start unveiling senior shadow ministers on Sunday afternoon, with MPs including Anneliese Dodds, Jo Stevens and Nick Thomas-Symonds widely tipped for top jobs. Asked about possible candidates on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show, Starmer said: “I’m not going to go into individual names. But it will be balanced across the party, it will be balanced across the country. And of course it will be balanced in terms of diversity.” Asked if he would include some Blairites in his frontbench team, Starmer said he wanted to move on from such labels.
“I will have in my shadow cabinet those that want to serve towards the future aim of winning that next general election. It’ll be a talented, balanced shadow cabinet,” he said. “We’re not looking back, we’re not badging people by the past. We’re going forward to the future, focusing on how we win the 2024 general election.” The former shadow Brexit secretary, who was director of public prosecutions before entering parliament, faces a difficult first task of unifying Labour around a new shadow cabinet, including how to bring in MPs who felt shut out under Corbyn without alienating Corbyn’s remaining supporters. Starmer told Marr that significant change was needed. “We just lost four elections in a row and therefore of course we need to change. If we don’t change we will lose the next general election.” He has pledged to work constructively with the government over the response to the pandemic while asking “difficult questions” when needed. Noting that he was taking over Labour in a “completely different world” even from December’s general election due to coronavirus, Starmer pledged to battle for a fairer economic outcome, saying it appeared inevitable that richer people and corporations would need to pay more tax in the coming years. He said it would be unthinkable to respond in the way the government did after the banking crash, with renewed austerity focused disproportionately on poorer people. “What we can’t do is go back to business as usual,” he said. “We now know who the key workers really are, and they very often have been overlooked and underpaid, and there has got to be a change. They were last and now they’ve got to be first.” Starmer declined to say it was inevitable that the government needed to extend the Brexit transition period beyond the end of this year, saying only that ministers should “extend it if it’s necessary to do so”, but he said the hard deadline had been an error. “I’ve always said I think that 12 months is going to be very tight,” he said. “I think the government made a mistake putting dates into legislation. It’s nearly always a mistake to put a date into legislation, because you don’t know what’s going to happen.” As an example of changes he would make in Labour, Starmer singled out his pledges to remove antisemitism from the party, noting that this had been one of the first issues he discussed after being elected. “It’s going to be a long road, it’s going to take a lot of hard work, but I hope I put in at least the first steps yesterday,” he said. Success on the issue would be judged, he added, “by the return of Jewish members to our party”."
2020-04-05T10:33:55Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock warns of tougher UK lockdown if too many break rules,"The government could stop people leaving their homes for exercise if too many people flout existing social distancing rules, for example by sunbathing in parks, the health secretary has said. Warning about the possibility of moves towards a fuller lockdown as seen in places such as France and Italy, Matt Hancock confirmed that under current rules, sitting or lying in parks was not permitted. “Sunbathing is against the rules that have been set out for important public health reasons,” Hancock, who has himself recently emerged from isolation after contracting the virus, told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show. “I wish I didn’t have to say this but I do because the whole country wants to come through this crisis.” Lambeth council in south London said Brockwell park would be closed on Sunday because so many people had sunbathed there on Saturday. “Despite clear advice, over 3,000 people spent today in Brockwell Park, many of them sunbathing or in large groups,” it tweeted on Saturday.
With sunny weather again expected across large parts of the country on Sunday, Hancock told the BBC’s Andrew Marr that people should be leaving home only for the four prescribed reasons – work as needed, buying food, for health reasons or for exercise – and he said the latter could be withdrawn if physical distancing was not being properly followed. “I think this example of exercise is a really important one, because we’ve said because of the positive benefits to your physical and your mental health that it’s OK to exercise on your own or with members of your own household,” he said. “But if the result of that is that too many people go out and flout the other rules because they say, ‘Well, if I can exercise then it’s fine for me to do other things,’ then I’m afraid we will have to take action. “So my message is really clear. If you don’t want us to have to take the step to ban exercise of all forms outside of your own home then you’ve got to follow the rules, and the vast majority people are following the rules.”
On the target announced last week to massively increase testing for coronavirus to up to 100,000 per day by the end of April, Hancock said he was “absolutely determined that we get there” but urged caution. “It’s going to be hard, and it’s going to require an awful lot of people to put their shoulders to the wheel across the life sciences industry and the NHS,” he said. Hancock was backed by the newly elected Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who said his party would support either a ban on outdoor exercise or on non-essential work if it was needed to curb the spread of Covid-19. “Yes we would. We do have to take whatever steps are necessary,” said Starmer, who was announced as Jeremy Corbyn’s successor on Saturday after winning more than 56% of Labour members’ votes. “Social distancing, staying indoors, is really difficult for people. It’s particularly difficult if you don’t have a garden, if you’re in a flat. And I know there are a lot of people in overcrowded accommodation. But we’ve got to get through this,” he said.
However, Angela Rayner, who was elected as Labour’s deputy leader, sounded a more cautious note, telling the Sophy Ridge show: “It’s all right for people who’ve got big houses and huge back gardens to say that, but if you’re stuck in inadequate accommodation, you’ve got no back garden, nowhere to go, and you’re on top of each other, people should do social distancing, but also be reasonable and proportionate about that.” Starmer, who played down the idea of some form of national unity government, said he would “ask difficult questions” over coronavirus, but avoid “opposition for opposition’s sake”. Starmer said he had come to an arrangement with Boris Johnson to receive ministerial briefings on the virus, and wanted to be constructive. He added: “But asking those difficult questions matters. You can see that when difficult questions were asked on testing things began to move. The same thing with equipment on the frontline. Scrutiny is important here.”
Speaking earlier on the Marr show, Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, one of the scientists whose modelling of the virus helped prompt the lockdown, said it was difficult to know when the measures might be eased as it depended on how quickly case numbers fell. “There is no point, having gone through this effort, in releasing a lockdown at a point where case numbers are still high and will resurge even faster than we have seen before,” he said. “We want case numbers to get to a low point where we can start substituting other measures for the most intrusive and economically costly aspects of the current lockdown.” Ferguson said it was also hard to predict the death toll in the UK but he believed these could be “anywhere between 7,000 or so up to a little over 20,000”."
2020-04-05T08:05:22Z,politics,Politics,From Attlee to Blair: what Starmer can learn from four Labour leaders,"In the party’s long and often turbulent life, Labour has been led by men of diverse characters and approaches. Here are four who offer lessons from history for Keir Starmer.
Clement Attlee “A modest man with much to be modest about”. “A grey little mouse”. “An empty taxi pulled up in front of No 10 and Mr Attlee got out”. For much of his career, Clement Attlee was subject to unflattering comparisons with more obviously talented rivals within his party, while being up against Winston Churchill, the flamboyant genius at wielding the English language. Yet Attlee won a landslide for Labour in 1945 and then presided over one of the great reforming governments. He is a prime example of how a reputation for dullness can become a virtue when it is reinterpreted as reliable decency and steady competence. That may be an inspiration to Starmer. During the 1945 election, the Tories played up Churchill as the glorious war leader by having their chief conveyed around the country in regal style by limousine and special train. Attlee went about in a modest Hillman helmed by his wife, Vi, a notoriously erratic driver. The contrast worked to the Labour leader’s advantage. After the privations of a conflict which had demanded a supreme collective effort, Britain was in a mood to embrace a more egalitarian postwar society. We can only guess whether the coronavirus crisis will have a similar effect on the national psyche, but it is possible. Harold Wilson Asked to name the Labour leader he most admired, Starmer made the unfashionable pick of Harold Wilson. He brought the party back to power in 1964 after a 13-year stretch in opposition, and it is instructive to recall how he went about it. One key component was relentless ridicule of the Tories as a party out of touch, out of time and hideously sleazy, an attack which was given a tailwind by the Profumo affair. Wilson was a very clever economics don who had not done a day of manual labour in his life, but he cultivated a “man of the people” image. In public, he puffed a pipe and claimed to like brown sauce. In private, he drank brandy and smoked cigars. The other key to Wilson’s success was to present Labour as the party of the future with a plan to modernise the country. He promised a “new Britain” which would be “forged in the white heat of the technological revolution”. It didn’t exactly work out like that in office, but the power of the idea helped Labour return to power. Neil Kinnock Labour was at rock bottom when Neil Kinnock was chosen to succeed Michael Foot in the wake of the 1983 “suicide note” election, which was about as calamitous for the party as its 2019 defeat. Kinnock was energetic, charismatic and mocked by his opponents as the “Welsh windbag”. Elected to the leadership from the “soft left”, he steadily junked policies, such as unilateral nuclear disarmament, which had repelled swing voters and traditional working-class supporters. It was a tough struggle often accompanied by cries of betrayal. He purged the far left extremists of the Militant tendency, famously condemning them in an electrifying speech to the Bournemouth conference in 1985. With the help of Peter Mandelson, party presentation and communications were transformed from hopeless amateurism into a slick professionalism which impressed the media and alarmed the Tories. Despite his best efforts, Kinnock never convinced the country to make him prime minister. He lost to Margaret Thatcher during a boom in 1987, and lost again, albeit more narrowly, to John Major in 1992, despite a recession. That said, it can be persuasively argued that Kinnock saved his party from existential danger and put it on the road to a recovery which culminated in New Labour’s 1997 landslide. Tony Blair There are plenty of lessons to learn from Labour’s most electorally successful leader. Tony Blair is the only one among them to win a back-to-back hat-trick of elections. Blair triumphed in 1997 by convincing the country that Labour had changed and changed for good, and could be trusted to change Britain for the better as well. The Conservatives were excluded from power for the next 13 years, their longest stretch in opposition in modern history. Even if he has absorbed things that Blair got right, Starmer will probably be very cautious about saying so. One poll asking Labour members to rate past leaders had Blair very near the bottom, below even Foot and Jim Callaghan. Polls of the public, by contrast, have Blair at or near the top of tables of most admired Labour leaders. Labour has not done its brand or morale much good by relentlessly running down its last period in power. This process of self-rubbishing began with Ed Miliband and intensified under Jeremy Corbyn. Starmer has suggested that he will cease the denigration of the Blair era. Labour will have a more promising future if it has a more mature and balanced understanding of how it won in the past."
2020-04-05T06:03:20Z,politics,Politics,'Labour must restore trust as a force for good and a force for change',"From Keir Starmer’s address on the day that his victory was announced “Coronavirus has brought normal life to a halt. Our cities, our towns and our villages are silent, our roads deserted. Public life has all but come to a standstill, and we’re missing each other. People are frightened by the strangeness, anxious about what will happen next. And we have to remember that every number is a family shaken to its foundation. It reminds us of what really matters: our family, our friends, our relationships. The love we have for one another. Our health. Our connections with those that we don’t know. A greeting from a stranger, a kind word from a neighbour. These make up society. They remind us that we share our lives together. We have to trust one another and look after one another. And I can see this happening, people coming together to help the isolated and the vulnerable, checking on their neighbours. Our willingness to come together like this as a nation has been lying dormant for too long. When millions of us stepped out on to our doorsteps to applaud the carers, visibly moved, there was hope of a better future. In times like this, we need good government, a government that saves lives and protects our country. It’s a huge responsibility and whether we voted for this government or not, we all rely on it to get this right. That’s why in the national interest the Labour party will play its full part. We will engage constructively with the government, not opposition for opposition’s sake. But we will test the arguments that are put forward. We will shine a torch on critical issues, and where we see mistakes, or faltering government, or things not happening as quickly as they should, we’ll challenge that and call that out. We will get through this. But when we do get through this we cannot go back to business as usual. This virus has exposed the fragility of our society. It’s lifted a curtain. Too many will have given too much. Some of us will have lost too much. We know in our hearts, things are going to have to change. We can see so clearly now who the key workers really are. When we get through this it’ll be because of our NHS staff, our care workers, our ambulance drivers, our emergency services, our cleaners, our porters. For too long they’ve been taken for granted and poorly paid. They were last and now they should be first. We must go forward with a vision of a better society built on that resilience and built on that human spirit. That will require bravery and change in our party as well… We have to face the future with honesty. Antisemitism has been a stain on our party. I have seen the grief that it’s brought to so many Jewish communities. On behalf of the Labour party, I am sorry. And I will tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us. The Labour party is an incredible and powerful force for good. But we’ve just lost four elections in a row. We’re failing in our historic purpose. We’ve got a mountain to climb. But we will climb it, and I will do my utmost to reconnect us across the country, to re-engage with our communities and voters, to establish a coalition across our towns and our cities and our regions with all creeds and communities, to speak for the whole of the country. Our mission has to be to restore trust in our party as a force for good and a force for change.”"
2020-04-05T06:03:20Z,politics,Politics,"The Corbyn project is over, but Keir Starmer still needs the left","Keir Starmer’s election as Labour leader marks the end of the Corbyn project and its domination of Labour’s internal politics. Having barely lost an internal election in four years, the alliance that elevated Jeremy Corbyn to the leadership is now shredded – in equal parts defeated, disillusioned and defected. But the hundreds of thousands of people who took part in the left’s re-emergence into British public life must not retreat into the shadows. The lessons of what went wrong must be learned – and the new leader must be pushed to understand that now is the time for bold ideas and opposition in response to the government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis.
The arithmetic of Starmer’s victory is relatively straightforward. In the summer of 2016, at the height of Corbyn’s popularity, Owen Smith still scored 38% of the vote. All that Corbyn-sceptics had to do was get behind a candidate who could win over a small part of Corbyn’s support base in the wake of a historic election defeat. Starmer’s team knew that they could afford to run a boring, low-risk campaign – and that is exactly what they did. Corbyn’s internal coalition was always very broad. It included much of the soft left of the party, and a large number of members who wanted to end austerity and break decisively from New Labour but whose politics didn’t go much further. The big majority opposed Brexit, and most of them get their perspective on internal party politics in broad brushstrokes from reading the news, not in granular detail from attending meetings. Starmer was an ideal candidate to appeal to this base: authentically soft left, and having played a high-profile and relatively loyal role in the shadow cabinet. But the most crucial factor at play was mass disillusionment within the Labour left, and the failure to deliver on the promise of 2015, despite Corbyn’s own instincts. After some early moments of hope, Corbyn’s leadership came to be run not by “a new kind of politics” but by the left wing of the old politics. Momentum’s role as a brilliantly effective mobilising tool masked a lack of internal democracy that rotted its grassroots potential. The party management machine, familiar to long-suffering party activists of any era, shut down attempts to bring in open selections for MPs and ensured that key decisions were taken by professionals behind closed doors, not by members. This time it was staffed by people who read the Morning Star rather than Progress magazine. Rebecca Long-Bailey was the continuity candidate for the outgoing leader’s office, and inherited all of its baggage – including its ambiguous Brexit position and the attempt by some of her prominent supporters to “blame Remain” for the 2019 election result, when the vast majority of Labour members always opposed Brexit. This meant that the grassroots energy on which the left always relies simply was not there. In 2016, I worked 12-hour days on the campaign to get Corbyn re-elected. In 2020, I grudgingly, passively, lent Long-Bailey my vote in order to increase the left’s perceived strength after the result. I don’t think I was alone. Keir Starmer enters the leadership at a pivotal moment, and he will need the left in more ways than one. With the left out of power, Starmer must be held to his commitment to honour Corbyn’s radical and popular economic policies. And with a failing government coronavirus strategy likely to leave people destitute and cause thousands of unnecessary deaths, Starmer’s response has so far been too cautious and lacking in bite. We badly need an opposition that can pull no punches in holding the government to account, breaking with any false idea of national unity and putting unprecedented progressive social measures on the table. In that task, the spirit of Corbynism may well be kept alive. Michael Chessum was a former member of the Momentum steering committee"
2020-04-05T06:00:20Z,politics,Politics,Plagues and wars alter economic policies: but not for ever | William Keegan,"As a classical scholar, our prime minister will be all too aware of some uncanny parallels between the onset of coronavirus and the plague that beset Athens in 430BC. The immortal historian Thucydides wrote: “At the beginning the doctors were quite incapable of treating the disease because of their ignorance of the right methods … In fact, mortality among the doctors was the highest of all since they came more frequently in contact with the sick.” Again: “Among the symptoms were sneezing and hoarseness of voice, and before long the pain settled on the chest and was accompanied by coughing.” Sound familiar? The plague struck just after the Athenians’ leader, Pericles, delivered his great funeral oration over the dead from the war against Sparta. Alas, Pericles himself died of the plague, and not long after Athens’s glory was in decline. Most historians would no doubt say that Britain’s glory days began their decline after the second world war. But one of the lessons from that war was that, well before it ended, the coalition government under Conservative prime minister Winston Churchill and Labour deputy prime minister Clement Attlee was planning for the aftermath. One of the main things on Attlee’s mind was that the poor social conditions of the interwar years should not be experienced again. Central to postwar planning was the formation of the NHS under the first Attlee administration of 1945-50, which was set up, amid fierce resistance from the medical profession, by Aneurin Bevan in 1948. There was no NHS in ancient Athens, and there is no NHS in the United States. To put it another way: we have a health service, they have a health sector. That is an important reason why, for all the well-publicised mishandling of this crisis in the UK, the US, still the mightiest economy in the world, seems to be in for an even bigger shock from the virus than we are experiencing. At this point – as one who was born a year before the outbreak of the 1939-45 war – I hope readers will forgive me if I point to an important difference in the dangers to the general public between then and now. Thus I confess that my initial inclination when asked what I felt personally about the virus – as opposed to thoughts about the disturbing political and economic implications – was to say something like: “This is nothing like watching flying bombs overhead, listening as their engines switched off, and hoping they didn’t land on you.” In fact one did land on the church at the end of our road and shattered our windows while we were safe in the Anderson shelter in the garden.
The awful thing about this plague is that it is more like the Athenian one 2,500 years ago or the Spanish flu of 1918. It doesn’t fly in or explode, it just hits people unawares – that is to say, we are aware of the danger, but don’t know if or when it will hit. A timely reminder of the horrors of germ warfare. In common with most of the population, I feel as if I am under house arrest. But when I hear and read so many comments about “draconian” conditions, my classical background comes back to me. There is a breed of historians who say that the common understanding of the epithet “draconian” is a misrepresentation, and that Draco wasn’t that bad: he merely codified existing civic practices. On the other hand, let’s face it: in ancient Athens, Draco prescribed the death penalty for petty theft – even of cabbages, if you please. According to Plutarch, this produced the memorable comment that “his laws were written not in ink but in blood”. So frankly, in the circumstances, I do not regard being asked to take precautions about the threat to my own and other people’s health – indeed, lives – as draconian. But back to the economy. The unemployment and bankruptcy news is horrendous, and likely to get worse before it gets better. There will be plenty of time in the coming months to examine the implications. But at this stage I should just issue a health warning (sorry) against taking some of the instant conclusions too seriously. The end of capitalism? I doubt it. The Conservative and Brexit party suddenly repenting of 10 years of austerity and becoming fully paid-up Keynesians? For how long, I wonder. Finally, why are we in this mess? Could it possibly be anything to do with the fact that during 10 years of austerity, public spending on health was budgeted to rise by 1% a year at most (in real terms – that is, after inflation) whereas all the professionals knew that it needed to rise by 4% a year merely to cope with the pressures of an ageing population and, especially, the cost of technological advance? And could it also possibly be because this government’s crazed obsession with Brexit means that it shut itself out of the joint ordering of vital medical supplies with the 27 members of the European Union? I merely ask."
2020-04-05T05:34:19Z,politics,Politics,"How ‘tenacious, diligent’ Keir Starmer won over a shell-shocked party","A few days before Keir Starmer was crowned leader of the Labour party, one of his shadow cabinet colleagues, Jon Trickett, made this observation about the way he operates. “He just has this inner drive. I get this impression that he thinks he has been driven by fate.” This quiet sense of destiny and “innate hunger”, Trickett said, seemed to affect much that Starmer did, and how he behaved. “One of the things I have noticed about Keir is that you can be walking through the Commons, or wherever it is, with him in a reasonably comradely way and then, suddenly, he would end up two strides ahead. It is just how he is.” Yesterday the Surrey-raised 57-year-old son of a toolmaker and a nurse, who named their son after the party’s first parliamentary leader, Keir Hardie, emerged not just strides but miles in front of his two rivals, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy, from the long contest to succeed Jeremy Corbyn.
The brilliant human rights lawyer who rose to become director of public prosecutions aged 45 in 2008 has only been an MP since 2015. But in a deeply divided party he managed to sweep up 56.2% of the vote, leaving Long-Bailey and Nandy way behind, on 27.6% and 16.2% respectively. Importantly, Starmer won a mandate across the board, winning the biggest share of the vote among MPs, members and affiliates. Many among Starmer’s own supporters and within his campaign team, who tied him ruthlessly and repetitively to messages about unity during more than 40 hustings, had thought early on that it would be a much closer fight. Some believed he would appear too “lawyerly” and wooden, while others feared that the left’s candidate Long-Bailey, MP for Salford and Eccles, would be propelled to victory by the pro-Corbyn organisation Momentum, which had the vital data on many of the 500,000 party members from the last two contests in 2015 and 2016. Another danger, his backers believed, was that Starmer, a London MP and star barrister with a square jaw and smart suits, would be seen in the Labour heartlands as another Blairite in left-wing clothing. But as it turned out, the left who had wanted Long-Bailey to win, including her union backers, fell out among themselves about how to carry Corbynism forward amid the post-general election acrimony, and her campaign never really took off. It was also not entirely clear how much she wanted the job and whether she felt forced against her better instincts to carry the torch for the Corbynistas.
“She went missing for the first four weeks of the campaign, which made everyone think she was wobbling, and when it started it was pretty much a disaster. By that time Starmer was miles ahead,” said one of her early backers. While Nandy impressed and won admirers, the MP for Wigan started too far behind, and was viewed as less tried and tested than Starmer. With the party shattered by its worst defeat since 1935, when the rebuilding process began, it was not ideological purity, flamboyance, or someone young and new that members across the Labour divide wanted – but someone reassuring and competent who they could see taking on and outshining Boris Johnson. And Starmer fitted the bill. Prominent names on the left such as Laura Parker, a former senior official in Corbyn’s office and a former national organiser of Momentum, chose Starmer and was followed by many other Momentumites. Parker, who had seen him operate in Labour’s Brexit sub-committee, said Starmer was “tenacious, forensic, diligent, intelligent”. His focus, determination and mastery of detail is something everyone who knows him observes. Importantly for Parker he had also, since the election, put forward a left-wing programme that for her was entirely credible, allowing her to feel it was a natural switch.
“He can seem cautious but the other side of that is that you feel you can believe the words that come out of his mouth,” Parker said. “He has said there will be no rolling back from a radical programme – and I, like others who supported Corbyn, backed him on the basis of the policy commitments he had in his 10 pledges.” One of Starmer’s supporters who manned phone banks for him said Momentum members came over in droves. “You could just hear them peeling off on the phone. They wanted someone who could win, people wanted someone professional – this came up a lot – and capable of governing as well as leading an effective opposition. They trusted him to do both. There is only a relatively small hardcore of the membership who think that ideological purity is more important than winning.” Starmer’s supporters deny that his campaign had been long in the planning. But he has been very careful in his five years in parliament not to make political enemies either at Westminster or in his Holborn and St Pancras constituency party – and to shore up support against potential challenges from the local left. Trickett, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, suggests Starmer deliberately avoided being associated with trouble-making factions in the parliamentary party, even when it was riven by disagreements over Brexit policy, which he was in charge of from 2016 until the election. “I am not aware that he had allegiances really, other than ones for temporary convenience.”
In fact his energy seems to have been spent on avoiding factionalism at every turn. In local Labour politics it was the same. Sally Gimson, an activist in Holborn and St Pancras, says that even when he was handling the Brexit brief in the shadow cabinet, Starmer had “never been too grand to come to the smallest fundraiser or support a tiny community group”. Lawyer Patrick Stevens, who was international director at the Crown Prosecution Service when Starmer was there, noticed the same approach when working with him before he entered politics: “He made sure he knew every person in my team from me to the most junior official and they all felt able to call him Keir. It was how he worked. In his first year at the DPP he went to every single one of its offices around the country and made sure he talked to everyone.” Starmer’s upbringing in Oxted no doubt shaped his views from a very early age. His mother was disabled and had to give up work because of a rare auto-immune disorder. He remembers spending many long nights with her at the local hospital. The young Keir was the only one of the four Starmer siblings to pass the 11-plus, which meant he could go on to Reigate grammar school. One of his contemporaries was Andrew Cooper, founder of the Populus polling organisation, who has memories of him as a popular and clubbable boy. “He was not brilliant in class, but near the top. What I remember of him does not quite fit with his public image now as slightly dull. He was very popular. He was often the one at the centre of the crowd telling the jokes.” Starmer’s more recent friends support Cooper’s view, insisting he can be the life and soul of a party. “He has got lots of friends. He is a huge Arsenal fan,” says Patrick Stevens. “He goes with the same group of his mates to a pub off the Holloway Road before every match. Keir also organises five-a-side games every Sunday and Monday. He sends out the texts and collects the subs.” Asked about his playing abilities Stevens added: “He is a midfield general ... with a silky left foot.”
Starmer studied law at Leeds University, where he took a first before graduating from St Edmund Hall, Oxford, as a bachelor of law. He was called to the bar in 1987. As a barrister at Doughty Street chambers, he took on a string of high-profile human rights cases, including the defendants in the “McLibel” case in 1997, which he worked on “pro bono” for 11 years. Mark Stephens, a lawyer who instructed him on many such cases before Starmer was appointed DPP, said: “He had a Rolls-Royce mind and a way to apply that mind that was wonderful to watch. There was never anything showy about him. He quietly got on with cases because he believed in what he was doing. If he had gone to the commercial bar, he would I think already be on the court of appeal and knocking at the door of the supreme court, if not already a shoo-in.” After becoming an MP in 2015 Starmer was appointed to the front bench by Corbyn to be in charge of immigration before resigning over Corbyn’s leadership in 2016. Despite this he was reappointed to the front bench as shadow Brexit secretary in 2016. While the eventual Brexit position which the party put to voters in December last year was a messy compromise, it was not for lack of effort on Starmer’s part. He had wanted a clearer commitment to Remain and a second referendum but had been unable to win the day with those around Corbyn. As he embarks on his leadership and begins to appoint his shadow cabinet today, it will not be Brexit that will preoccupy Starmer but rather Labour’s approach to the coronavirus pandemic. The new leader has won a handsome mandate from a party that has placed its trust in his forensic, tenacious approach to politics and the crises it throws up. The current crisis could hardly be bigger. In his statement yesterday, Starmer said: “Whether we voted for this government or not, we all rely on it to get this right. That’s why in the national interest the Labour party will play its full part.” The coming weeks will be a test like no other in his hitherto glittering career."
2020-04-05T05:32:19Z,politics,Politics,"Covid-19, party factions, antisemitism: the key issues for Keir Starmer","
Covid-19 The coronavirus crisis is all all-consuming and will be Starmer’s immediate focus. When to criticise the government, and how hard, will be a delicate political judgment – calls for a change of course, or an inquiry, will need to be carefully timed. The Brexit debate showed Starmer was at his lawyerly best when putting ministers under pressure over the fine detail of their plans – a quality now greatly needed. Yet there are competing pressures. Elsewhere in the world, opposition figures have struggled to make any impact as the outbreak has developed, which will create pressure for bolder interventions. A balancing act. The economy After years of disagreements since 2010, most in Labour had become united on a broad rejection of austerity and a demand on the rich to pay more tax. Starmer had accepted key Corbyn tax pledges from the 2019 manifesto. However, the costs of the coronavirus will shake up the debate and force Starmer into difficult decisions. How to pay for the fallout is not a topic of great discussion now, but it will cause problems for both main parties. The degree and speed with which Starmer proposes to repair the public finances will be highly contentious and risks opening up tensions with Labour’s left. Party machinery During the current leader’s reign, the party’s left has been successful in occupying key posts and winning a majority on its powerful national executive committee. Control of the party machinery has always been critical in Labour’s internal politics, and many Labour MPs are keen to see Starmer clear out the party’s HQ, including the current general secretary Jennie Formby, a close ally of Corbyn and Unite union boss, Len McCluskey. However, any immediate clearout would be seen as an act of war by the left and undermine Starmer’s plea for unity. Antisemitism inquiry Starmer will need to work out a response to the antisemitism inquiry undertaken by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The issue has seriously damaged Labour’s reputation among Jewish voters and beyond. While it will be a difficult moment for the party, Starmer’s initial response will be quite simple – accept the report and its recommendations. He has already pledged to toughen party rules on antisemitism. The more difficult issue will be to what extent he reprimands anyone singled out in the inquiry and still employed by Labour. Shadow cabinet Starmer’s first shadow cabinet will be a key early decision and reveal the extent to which he wants to change course or carry on with Corbyn’s team. John McDonnell and Diana Abbott are both stepping down, but what of other Corbyn allies such as Ian Lavery and Richard Burgon? And will Starmer opt to bring back big hitters like Yvette Cooper and Rachel Reeves, or leave them overseeing select committees? Will Corbyn be offered a new post, perhaps party president? A demonstration of unity seems to be Starmer’s priority in appointing a team, so a clearout seems unlikely."
2020-04-04T21:06:09Z,politics,Politics,Starmer: Labour will work with PM to fight Covid-19 in national interest,"Keir Starmer has vowed to work with Boris Johnson “in the national interest” to guide Britain through the mounting coronavirus outbreak, after the prime minister published a letter urging leaders of opposition parties to “work together” with the government. In a phone call with the prime minister after being elected Labour leader, Starmer offered to work constructively with the prime minister and not provide “opposition for opposition’s sake”. However, with pandemic experts warning this weekend about the difficult route out of the lockdown, Starmer said he would “call out” the government over failings in its strategy. Starmer has agreed to meet the prime minister this week. Johnson remained in self-isolation on Saturday with a temperature after he contracted the virus. The pledge between the party leaders came as: • Numbers of daily new cases of Covid-19 dropped from 4,450 on Friday to a total of 3,735, leading to hopes that the disease’s spread could be levelling off. Total numbers of UK cases of the disease now stand at 41,903. An additional 708 people died. • It emerged that 212 patients in the Midlands have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the last 24 hours – more than London, which has been hit hardest so far, which had 127 deaths. • There were signs of a slight drop in public confidence in the government’s handling of the pandemic. An Opinium poll for the Observer found that approval of the government’s handling dropped from a net approval of +42% last week to +23% this week. • Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister, warned that there was evidence that the young were less compliant with social distancing orders, as he pleaded with the public to show “self-restraint” and follow the lockdown measures. • It was announced that the Queen will praise the nation for its “self-discipline” and “resolve” during the coronavirus pandemic in a rare televised address broadcast on Sunday.
The Cambridge University statistician, Sir David Speigelhalter, said the drop in the number of new cases gave grounds for optimism. “I am relieved. We should be seeing a flattening of the upward curve of new cases and these figures are entirely compatible with such a trend. It looks like we are beginning to see a levelling off of the disease’s spread,” he said. But as ministers plead with the public to stay home, there are concerns in Whitehall over maintaining the lockdown in the weeks ahead. One source said: “If numbers turn, front pages saying we’re winning the war, that will be tough. Broadly at the moment, no one is going outside. If that changes, it could change quickly.” There was also a warning from a leading pandemic expert that failings “ranging from lack of preparedness to complacency” meant that there was now no alternative to building immunity in the population, either through gradual infection or vaccination – which could be more than a year away. Francois Balloux, professor of computational systems biology and the director of the University College London genetics institute, said: “I personally, cannot see any viable alternative to ensuring immunity builds up in the population, through infection or vaccination. What is critical is to minimise hospital overload, to ensure mortality is kept as low as possible. There was a window of opportunity earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic, where it could have been controlled. We missed it, for various reasons, ranging from lack of preparedness to complacency. We should analyse our failings in the future, but now is not the time for blame.”
A No 10 spokesperson responded: “As set out by the prime minister, we are working to a scientifically-led, step-by-step action plan – taking the right measures at the right time.” However, there is now an open debate in Whitehall and the scientific community about the best route out of the lockdown measures, which government advisers have suggested may need to be in place until the end of May. Professor Martin Hibberd, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, pointed to successful strategies employed in other countries. These have involved very large-scale testing and as much contact tracing as possible, to identify people with the virus. “This strategy was difficult to achieve at the beginning of the outbreak, because of logistic problems in testing at such a large scale and our lack of experience at large scale contact tracing,” Hibberd added. “However, we should now be able to overcome these problems.” Mark Woolhouse at Edinburgh University highlighted three key strategies for dealing with the epidemic. “Once lockdown has driven down the virus to low enough levels in the community we can go back to chasing down individual cases. At the same time we build more ICU capacity in the NHS so we can relax the lockdown without the health service being overwhelmed. And thirdly, we place new emphasis in shielding the vulnerable.” By contrast, John Edmunds, also of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, argued that the only way to proceed was to continue with the lockdown policy for many months. “Testing on its own will not stop this epidemic,” he said. “If you want the NHS to cope then you will have to take extreme measures for a long time. There is no way out. We will have social distance for many months or hospitals will be overwhelmed. Mass testing, mass contact tracing and more technology are fine, but what we really need is a vaccine.”
Starmer used his acceptance address to vow that the country could not go “back to business as usual” once the pandemic was under control. “This virus has exposed the fragility of our society. It’s lifted a curtain. Too many will have given too much. Some of us will have lost too much. We know in our hearts, things are going to have to change,” he said. Yesterday, Carrie Symonds, the prime minister’s pregnant partner, revealed she had spent a week in bed with the main symptoms of Covid-19, but said she was “on the mend”. • This article was amended on 5 April 2020 to correct a quote from Sir David Spiegelhalter."
2020-04-04T18:22:44Z,politics,Politics,Victorious Keir Starmer pledges to restore trust in Labour,"Sir Keir Starmer has promised to rebuild the nation’s trust in the Labour party after winning a stunning victory to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as leader.
The 57-year-old former shadow Brexit secretary secured more than twice as many votes as the runner-up – Rebecca Long-Bailey, the candidate of the Corbyn camp – and over three times as many as third-placed Lisa Nandy, the MP for Wigan. By securing 56.2% of the votes of almost half a million Labour members and affiliates, he has emerged with a huge and powerful mandate to lead the party as he chooses, after four-and-a-half years of the Corbyn project, during which two general elections were lost. Angela Rayner won a clear victory to succeed Tom Watson as deputy leader, defeating Dr Rosena Allin-Khan and the left’s candidate, Richard Burgon, after three rounds of voting. In a pre-recorded acceptance speech, Starmer said becoming leader was the “honour and privilege” of his life – but one that had been bestowed upon him “at a moment like none other in our lifetime”. Coronavirus, he said, had left “our towns and villages deserted” and had reminded us of “what really matters, our family, our friends, our relationships. The love we have for one another. Our health.” Starmer will begin appointing his shadow cabinet on Sunday, announcing who will fill the roles of shadow chancellor, shadow foreign secretary, shadow home secretary and shadow health secretary. A spokesman said it would reflect all views and represent all wings of the party: “The team Keir supports will reflect the breadth of talent across the party and will be a team ready to take on the task of winning the next general election.” Supporters of Starmer hope his success will put pressure on some of the key individuals close to Corbyn, who have remain in senior posts after the disastrous general election defeat last December, to step down.
These include Karie Murphy, Corbyn’s former chief of staff, and Jennie Formby, the party’s general secretary, who is also close to the former Labour leader. In a scathing comment on the Labour’s failings of the last few years, Lord (Iain) McNicol, the party’s former general secretary under Starmer’s predecessor, told the Observer he was glad the Corbyn era was finally over. Starmer’s victory was, he said, a chance to recreate a “professional” party that could chart a route back to power. “Keir’s election provides the opportunity to rebuild a professional, election-focused party capable of leading the country, something that has been sorely missing over the past few years,” said McNicol. “Keir brings the energy, experience and political astuteness that we desperately need to reinvigorate our party. The sad fact that Labour has the lowest number of MP since the second world war tells you everything you need to know about the Corbyn experiment. I, like thousands in the Labour party, am thankful that that chapter is now closed.” Starmer made clear he would take whatever action was necessary to reform the party, including rooting out the “stain” of antisemitism. “I will tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us,” he said. He will begin discussions this week with Jewish leaders. Long-Bailey, Nandy and Corbyn all congratulated Starmer and said they looked forward to working with him. Long-Bailey said: “Keir Starmer will make a brilliant prime minister and I cannot wait to see him in No 10. I will do all I can to make that a reality.” Nandy said that the current coronavirus crisis meant that Labour could rebuild trust fast and become the next government. “The road back to power is steep, but it does not have to be long,” she said. “Our country is crying for fresh leadership. We start today.”"
2020-04-04T18:22:40Z,politics,Politics,A conference call with his defeated rivals – then Keir Starmer was straight down to business,"Keir Starmer was at home in north London at 10.30am on Saturday when he heard he had become leader of Labour party. The news was broken to him and the two defeated candidates, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy, in a conference call organised by Jenny Formby, the party’s general secretary.
After accepting everyone’s congratulations, Starmer composed himself, brushed himself down and headed straight off with two of his officials to the leader of the opposition’s office in Westminster. There his first task was to ring Boris Johnson at No 10 to accept the prime minister’s offer to work together on the coronavirus crisis. The suite of rooms in Portcullis House allotted to the opposition leader had been vacated by Jeremy Corbyn and his staff – or at least largely vacated – some days before. “It was a bit of a mess to be honest when we got there,” said a source close to Starmer. “There were boxes, clothes, papers everywhere.” Starmer must now start sorting out the mess that is the Labour party. But as if that were not challenge enough, a very large part of his focus must also be on the national emergency which forms an extraordinary backdrop to the start of his leadership. In his call with Johnson, the new Labour leader agreed to meet him in Downing Street next week to discuss what must be done to tackle coronavirus, and to hold further discussions at regular intervals on privy council terms . He said in his victory statement that with the pandemic wreaking havoc, Labour needed to be ready to behave differently to an opposition in normal times and to have “the courage to support where that’s the right thing to do”, while fully holding the Johnson government to account. Starmer will now begin the task of restoring unity and a sense of belief within a Labour party whose morale has been shattered by two general election defeats under Corbyn, the latter of which, last December, was the worst for Labour since 1935. He will start appointing his shadow cabinet on Sunday, providing key signals as to how inclusive he intends to be after years of factionalism. In the afterglow of his victory, he will have been gratified by signs that the party is ready to pull together. Congratulations and good wishes were showered on Starmer (who’s seen as on the soft left) from people on the left, right and centre of Labour. From the right, former cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw expressed relief at the result, tweeting: “So happy for my beloved Labour party & country. First time I’ve backed a winning candidate the public might make PM since TB.” But from the left, too, there was a recognition that Starmer had won a mandate that should command loyalty across the party. Sam Tarry, the new MP for Ilford South, who used to work for Corbyn, said both Starmer and the newly elected deputy leader, Angela Rayner, had been supported by people from across the party, and there was no alternative but to feel hope and come together. “There is a real mood in the party to unite,” said Tarry. In a further sign that the grip of the left had been weakened, three byelections to the national executive committee on Saturday all delivered “mainstream” candidates. Starmer faces huge challenges rebuilding a party all but destroyed in Scotland, and which imploded at the election in many of its heartlands in the north and Midlands. There is also the issue of antisemitism and the upcoming report of the Equality and Human Rights Commission on Labour’s handling of complaints into the issue. That hovers like a giant cloud. But there was a sense that, out of the disasters of coronavirus and its recent election losses, Labour can show again that it is the party of community, of public service, of working people who make the country function."
2020-04-04T12:42:31Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer elected Labour leader with 56% of vote on first round — as it happened,"Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has won a resounding victory in the Labour leadership contest. He got 56.2% of the first-preference votes, beating Rebecca Long-Bailey (on 27.6%) and Lisa Nandy (on 16.2%). See 11.17am. Angela Rayner was elected deputy leader, with Rosena Allin-Khan as runner-up but a long way behind. See 11.28am. The result marks a decisive break with the Jeremy Corbyn era. Although Starmer was reluctant to criticise Corbyn to any significant extent during the leadership contest, and although he has committed to keeping the key elements of the 2019 Labour manifesto, his background and political outlook make him a very different sort of leader. Corbynâ€™s enemies in the party have warmly welcomed the result (see 12.45pm), while Corbynâ€™s supporters have urged Starmer not to abandon Corbynâ€™s radicalism. (See 11.45am.) You can read the results in full on the Labour website here. Starmer has agreed to meet Boris Johnson next week to discuss the governmentâ€™s response to the coronavirus crisis. Johnson said in an open letter to opposition party leaders that all parties â€œhave a duty to work together at this moment of national emergencyâ€�. (See 10.19am.) But, in his victory speech, Starmer said that working constructively with the government would not mean avoiding being critical when that was deserved. He said: Under my leadership we will engage constructively with the government, not opposition for oppositionâ€™s sake. Not scoring party political points or making impossible demands. But with the courage to support where thatâ€™s the right thing to do. But we will test the arguments that are put forward. We will shine a torch on critical issues and where we see mistakes or faltering government or things not happening as quickly as they should weâ€™ll challenge that and call that out. Starmer said that there must be no return to â€œbusiness as usualâ€� after the coronavirus crisis is over. In his victory speech he said: When we do get through this we cannot go back to business as usual. This virus has exposed the fragility of our society. Itâ€™s lifted a curtain. Too many will have given too much. Some of us will have lost too much. We know in our hearts, things are going to have to change. We can see so clearly now who the key workers really are. When we get through this itâ€™ll be because of our NHS staff, our care workers, our ambulance drivers, our emergency services, our cleaners, our porters. It will be because of the hard work and bravery of every key worker as they took on this virus and kept our country going. For too long theyâ€™ve been taken for granted and poorly paid. They were last and now they should be first. In their courage and their sacrifice and their bravery, we can see a better future. This crisis has brought out the resilience and human spirit in all of us. He issued a fresh apology for antisemitism in the Labour party and promised to â€œtear out this poisonâ€�. In his victory speech he said: Antisemitism has been a stain on our party. I have seen the grief that itâ€™s brought to so many Jewish communities. On behalf of the Labour party, I am sorry. And I will tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments."
2020-04-04T10:49:33Z,politics,Politics,Labour gives Keir Starmer strong mandate to face battles ahead,"Sir Keir Starmer’s victory, winning 56.2% of the vote in the race to become Labour leader, is almost on a par with that of Tony Blair in 1994, when he won 57% of the vote, and Jeremy Corbyn in 2015, when he took 59.5%. It represents a clear internal mandate, after an interminable contest which began quite literally in another political era, for a candidate who ran an undramatic, error-free campaign that successfully emphasised his long experience as a lawyer involved in every major Labour cause for a generation. Winning the Labour contest, however, will quickly seem like the easy part. The political scale of the task facing Starmer is extraordinary. The three polls taken since Boris Johnson ordered a national coronavirus lockdown place the Conservatives at 54%, 54% and 52% respectively, miles ahead of Labour on 28%. David Cowling, a polling expert, said the Tories were recording “their highest voting intention figures since polling began in the UK in the late 1930s”, although there are stray polls that have had the party at similar levels in the late 1970s. In more recent memory, the governing party is hitting levels of support not seen since just after Blair won by a landslide in 1997. And this week YouGov reported that the British public had given the government a positive approval rating for the first time since May to October 2010, just after the election of the coalition. Some of this is lingering post-election honeymoon period, the normal popularity of a newly elected government. Some of it is because Labour has simply been absent from the battlefield due, until now, to its lack of a leader with an internal mandate – although there has already been internal criticism that Starmer has been too quiet on coronavirus thus far. The numbers may be eye-catching, but in other ways the current polls need not be taken too seriously. The coronavirus crisis is a rare political reset moment, like the 2008 financial crisis, allowing Labour to speak up for what should be its core values: community, solidarity and public service, as embodied by the NHS. It also finally moves the national conversation away from Brexit – exploited, of course, so successfully by Johnson. Come 2024, the date of the next election, the issues facing the nation will probably be different: how we allowed so little margin of error in our health service, social care, food supply and economy that meant the country came to crisis within days. That, though, is a long way off. New leaders are always given a chance by the public to establish themselves, and if they do well, reset the image of their party. Even among Labour voters, according to YouGov, more think Jeremy Corbyn changed the party for the worse than not by 36% to 27%. Starmer’s forensic skills will undoubtedly help him pick apart the government’s problems over virus testing and long-term financial help for people left behind by the government’s various rescue packages – although his legal talents were not enough to defeat the government over Brexit. Conservative backbench MPs are jittery, fearful that there could be a swift backlash against the government if restrictions continue for long without an end in sight. The growing impatience in Italy shows that government support could evaporate quickly, although the early irritation as shown by some hostile Daily Telegraph front pages is coming largely from the right. Above all, Labour needs to present a positive picture – build a diverse, dynamic team; end the sectarian squabbling that made the party so unattractive to voters; deal once and for all with the issue of antisemitism – before looking beyond the current crisis to propose an alternative vision for a stronger, healthier Britain. Electing Starmer gives the party a chance to do that."
2020-04-04T10:13:58Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer wins Labour leadership election,"Sir Keir Starmer has won the Labour leadership election with more than 56% of the vote, bringing an end to Jeremy Corbyn’s tenure of almost five years at the top of the party. Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions, won in the first round as the top choice of members, affiliates and registered supporters, with 490,731 votes cast overall. His nearest rival, Rebecca Long-Bailey, got 28% of the vote, and Lisa Nandy 16% in the final leg of the race. Angela Rayner was elected deputy leader in the third round on 53%, with the doctor Rosena Allin-Khan in surprise second place on 26% and Richard Burgon on 21%.
Starmer’s immediate priority will be to respond to Boris Johnson’s call for all party leaders to work together to tackle the coronavirus crisis. Speaking after the result, Starmer said he would work constructively with the government and that his victory had come “at a moment like none other in our lifetime” as normal life had been brought to a halt. He also said he was aware of the scale of the task ahead of him, with the Conservatives enjoying near-record support. “We’ve just lost four elections in a row. We’re failing in our historic purpose,” he said in a video message. “Be in no doubt I understand the scale of the task, the gravity of the position that we’re in. “We’ve got a mountain to climb, but we will climb it, and I will do my utmost to reconnect us across the country, to re-engage with our communities and voters, to establish a coalition across our towns and our cities and our regions with all creeds and communities to speak for the whole of the country. “Where that requires change, we will change. Where that requires us to rethink, we will rethink.” Starmer’s victory marks the end of the Corbyn era, during which the party took a sharp turn to the left. The Corbynite left of the party had backed Long-Bailey for leader and Burgon for deputy, but neither came close to challenging the eventual winners, indicating appetite among the membership and supporters for a change of direction following Labour’s election defeat in December. The former shadow Brexit secretary is consideredsofter-left than Corbyn, but he has promised the former leader’s supporters not to steer too far away from his predecessor’s radical policy programme of nationalisation and fighting austerity. The MP for Holborn and St Pancras will now start to put together a shadow cabinet and a team of advisers that is expected to draw from all wings of the party in an effort to draw a line under the factionalism that has dogged Labour in recent years. He has suggested he will give shadow cabinet roles to Long-Bailey and Nandy. Starmer, who was instrumental in the party’s pro-second referendum position, will find his time dominated not by Brexit, but how Labour should respond as an opposition to the coronavirus crisis and its impact. Just before the announcement of the result, the prime minister wrote to all opposition leaders saying: “As party leaders, we have a duty to work together at this time of national emergency. Therefore, I would like to invite all opposition leaders to a briefing with myself, the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser next week.” In his acceptance statement, Starmer said Labour would “engage constructively with the government, not opposition for opposition’s sake” during the crisis. “Not scoring party political points or making impossible demands. But with the courage to support where that’s the right thing to do. “But we will test the arguments that are put forward. We will shine a torch on critical issues and where we see mistakes or faltering government or things not happening as quickly as they should we’ll challenge that and call that out.” Rayner said it would be a “long and difficult road ahead but we must unite, both in the face of this crisis and to offer the better future that the citizens of our country deserve”.
“Things have dramatically changed in our country in recent months but our values remain the same, and more important than ever,” she said. “Those are the values we will reflect in our actions as an opposition and a movement – standing up for our public services, for our workers and carers, and for a society in which people work together and look after one another.” Starmer and Rayner were congratulated by a wide range of trade unions and affiliated groups, including former Corbyn supporters. Unite, which had backed Long-Bailey and is Labour’s biggest donor, highlighted their pledges to “build upon our party’s radicalism”. Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, said: “It is the job now of our movement to support them in this as they move forward to ensure our party plays its full part in our national political life in these unprecedented times.” Momentum, the grassroots group of Corbyn supporters, released a statement signalling its intent to hold Starmer to account in terms of keeping support for public ownership of national services, a green new deal, scrapping tuition fees, closing immigration detention centres and taxing the top 5% of earners. “His mandate is to build on Jeremy’s transformative vision, and this means appointing a broad shadow cabinet who believe in the policies and will work with members to make them a reality,” a spokesman said. “In this new era Momentum will play a new role. We’ll hold Keir to account and make sure he keeps his promises, champion big ideas like the green new deal, build the power of Labour members and do everything we can to get a Labour government elected.”"
2020-04-03T17:50:04Z,politics,Politics,"Public inquiry into No 10's Covid-19 response inevitable, peer says","The scale of the coronavirus outbreak and the response it has required from government means a large-scale public inquiry is now inevitable, a former head of the civil service has said. Sir Bob Kerslake said the scope of the decision-making undertaken by politicians and officials had been vast, and, as some of it had already been challenged, there would need to be a chance to reflect upon the UK’s response in case of another pandemic. “There will need to be some sort of inquiry after we get through this to learn lessons,” said Lord Kerslake, who is a crossbench peer. “This is one where we might face the same situation again. “I hope that even during this clear crisis moment there is a proper record being kept of who made decisions and why, because that will be very, very important. Not to lay blame – though clearly there will be a bit of that – but to plan for the future. We could face this again and it could be even worse.” Kerslake also warned Downing Street against appointing people with election skills and backgrounds in political messaging over those with the exact skills for the task in hand. His intervention echoes repeated acknowledgments by ministers that their decisions are likely to be scrutinised at a future inquiry and No 10 accepts that this is likely to be on the horizon. A senior Tory source said questions over testing, the government’s initial consideration of herd immunity, ventilator stocks, the way ideas have been briefed to the press, and the delivery of personal protective equipment would all be issues any inquiry might want to look at. They said: “There has to be a public inquiry about how decisions were taken and what was happening beforehand while the virus was still in Wuhan in China. What was the planning, what was flagged to who and when?” An ex-No 10 staffer said no one working on coronavirus from within Downing Street would be overly concerned about a forthcoming inquiry, but they would always have “one eye” on what would be subject to a freedom of information request and any leaks of information, particularly when they involved worst-case scenario planning. Downing Street is said to be urgently bringing trusted people back on board to help deal with the crisis, including Isaac Levido, the head of the Tories’ successful 2019 general election campaign. He has been tasked with improving the party’s public health communications campaign. Tom Shinner, a civil servant who was formerly head of no-deal Brexit planning, has been drafted back into Downing Street to coordinate Whitehall’s response to Covid-19.
Kerslake said Shinner had clearly impressed the government over Brexit and that Levido was known for his skills with election communications, but that the job now required a firm grasp of data and science. He said: “This is more about how do you keep the public on side because this requires massive voluntary effort. People have to choose to follow the rules and how do you keep confidence with the public. “The communication task goes beyond producing messaging. If that’s all Levido does, I’m not sure he will add a lot, but if he can recognise the … task that’s needed now and how different it is to an election campaign, then he might bring something to it. If he does a rerun of the election, he’s got it wrong.” A No 10 insider said Shinner was a brilliant civil servant and exactly the right person to work on Covid-19. The senior Tory source said they were worried about the new appointees – particularly Levido – because of their political background. They said: “You need people who understand the logistical challenges. Experts in disaster relief. A lot of these people already exist within government who look after crisis briefs. Winning elections is good but undoubtedly this is different.”"
2020-04-03T17:25:11Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock calls for more volunteers to take part in 'essential' clinical trials – as it happened,"With warm weather forecast this weekend, in a moving moment during the daily news conference the chief nurse Ruth May pleaded with people to remember Aimee Oâ€™Rourke and Areema Nasreen, two nurses who died after contracting Covid-19. â€œPlease stay at home, for themâ€�.
The health secretary Matt Hancock issued a call for more volunteers to take part in â€œessentialâ€� clinical trials. He said the bigger the trials, the greater the data, the faster treatments can be rolled out. UK hospital deaths saw a record daily rise of 684, bringing the total to 3,605 patients who have died after testing positive for Covid-19. The NHS Nightingale Hospital in London was opened by the health secretary and the Prince of Wales (via video link). In addition to ones in Birmingham and Manchester, two more temporary hospitals were announced in Bristol and Harrogate. The Welsh government is to make it a legal obligation for companies to ensure employees stay 2 metres apart. The law will come into effect on either Monday or Tuesday next week. The Premier League will ask footballers to take a 30% wage cut and it is committing Â£20m to the NHS and Â£125m to lower leagues. It also confirmed the league would not resume at the end of May. Confirmed cases among inmates rose by 20% in the last 24 hours to 88 across 29 prisons in England and Wales. The prime minister Boris Johnson remained in self-isolation as he continued to have a high temperature. Road travel fell to levels not seen since 1955 as all forms of travel plunged in urban areas. The exam regulator unveiled plans for how GCSE and A-level students will get their grades: a combination of teacher assessment, class rank and school performance will determine grades. And finally, the Queen has recorded a special coronavirus broadcast, which will be aired on Sunday. It will be only the fourth time she has issued a televised address to the nation in troubled periods."
2020-04-03T17:16:32Z,politics,Politics,What is in the new Labour leader's in-tray?,"Labour’s new leader will be faced with a full in-tray. At the top of the pile is likely to be: 1 Brexit transition Should Labour argue that UK’s exit from the single market be delayed because businesses are too busy dealing with the fallout from the coronavirus crisis to prepare for new trading arrangements? If the new leader argues for a pause in talks, that risks looking like a refusal to accept the referendum result and would give Boris Johnson and new Tory MPs in traditional Labour seats an enormous stick to beat the party with. However, if the party argues against a postponement, this could alienate Labour’s predominantly pro-EU base and many in the business community.
2 Coronavirus criticism of the government Some Labour MPs believe Keir Starmer, the leadership frontrunner, has been missing in the current debate, leaving the floor open to unlikely critics such as Jeremy Hunt and the Daily Telegraph. But despite criticisms, the government is riding high in the polls and the public appears to be demanding a united front during a national crisis. The new leader will have to decide when it is appropriate to criticise the government … and when to hold back. 3 Antisemitism in the party Jeremy Corbyn’s critics wish to see his successor take swift action against anyone who has been found to have made antisemitic comments or implicated in covering up the extent of antisemitism in the party. An inquiry by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) into Labour is ongoing. Jewish community groups have asked that the new leader begins a clear out of those who failed to act swiftly against antisemites. Should the leader wait for a conclusion of the EHRC inquiry, or make a move?
4 Absorbing Corbynism Some Corbyn supporters are calling for the new shadow cabinet to be a “broad church” and offer roles to the departing leader’s supporters. Starmer has already said he would offer a job to his opponent Rebecca Long-Bailey, a Corbyn follower, in a future shadow cabinet. Corbynites will want to ensure it is a significant job and not an effort to sideline her. 5 Party finances Labour under Corbyn had become reliant on the deep pockets of Len McCluskey’s Unite the union, a source of cash that may well dry up if Starmer wins and pushes out McCluskey’s allies Karie Murphy and Jennie Formby. If Starmer is victorious, would Unison step in? Would he be able to rely on members’ donations or might Labour seek corporate donors once again?"
2020-04-03T15:41:45Z,politics,Politics,Next Labour leader will have to rise to challenge of coronavirus crisis,"If anyone needs reminding how much the political world has changed in a few weeks, it is useful to recall that Labour’s leadership campaign was timed to finish this weekend so that a new leader could carry the contest’s momentum into May’s local elections. Those elections, usually seen as an important marker in the political calendar, have instead been postponed along with parliament and most of the UK economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. The leadership contest has gained little coverage as the NHS struggles with demand for intensive care beds. With Labour’s support, civil liberties have been curtailed as Boris Johnson’s government tries to eradicate the coronavirus and stem the spiralling number of deaths.
If, as expected, Keir Starmer wins the contest on Saturday, he will lead the party in a world where he will be expected to hold ministers to account as they make momentous decisions about Treasury spending, NHS services, logistics, mass surveillance and food supplies. Far from being cowed by the challenge, Starmer’s supporters believe his background as a former director of public prosecutions makes him an ideal potential leader at a time of national crisis. Angela Eagle, the MP for Wallasey and a former minister, said this was a moment made for a serious politician such as Starmer. “There are pivot points in history where leaders can remake the political weather and set the agenda. This is one of them. And I think Keir has the personal and moral authority and a strategic vision to rise to the occasion,” she said.
Andrew Fisher, a former head of policy for Jeremy Corbyn, said the next Labour leader would have to keep their focus on who the government will expect to pay for the £350bn of support for the economy in the face of the pandemic. “Whenever this coronavirus crisis ends, the country is going to be in huge debt, spending will have gone up, there will be a lot more people claiming benefits, the Tories’ economic plans will be ripped up and they will be looking for someone to pay,” he said. “Labour has got to be very strong at making sure it’s not the most vulnerable who pay the price. We were quite weak on that in the five years after the financial crash.” Fisher said it was important that if Starmer won he ensured the shadow cabinet reflected views across the party and not within a single faction. “He is obviously going to change the shadow cabinet ... but he does need to find a balance, a broad church in a Wilsonian way, so he does have a range of opinion in there,” he said. He added that a new leader would have to react to the Conservatives’ recent conversion to approving the partial nationalisation of transport. “The new leader will have to look at the measures put in place temporarily and work out which they want to continue and campaigning for those where appropriate.” Society will have changed after the coronavirus, Fisher said, which may increase a Labour government’s appeal as long as the party sets a radical economic agenda. “People’s values, people’s experiences have shifted. We don’t know what the level of unemployment will be or the level of people on reduced hours will be at the end of this crisis but it’s clearly going to be substantially up,” he said. “Labour can tap into that at the right time. Trying to be too sharply political at this time when people are very anxious about their security, housing and income and their health would be wrong and I think Labour has got the tone right.”"
2020-04-03T15:17:54Z,politics,Politics,Wales to introduce 2-metre coronavirus law to protect workers,"Employers in Wales will be breaking the law from next week if they do not make sure that staff are able to maintain the 2-metre physical distancing rule.
The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, made it clear he did not want companies to be shut down but said it was vital that they put the welfare of their employees first. Employees across the UK in workplaces including call centres, factories and building sites have expressed concern that they are unable to stay a safe distance from colleagues. Drakeford said the Welsh government had listened to workers’ fears and would be the first in the UK to bring in a new law requiring employers to take “all reasonable actions” to comply with the 2-metre rule. The first minister said the regulations would come into force on Monday or Tuesday next week and fresh guidance would be issued to make sure that employers understood what was being expected of them. He said: “It is simply saying to employers they must put the needs of their workforce first. Their health and well-being must be top of the agenda.
“We’ve heard the messages coming from some people saying they are fearful at the way their health is being compromised in the workplace.” The GMB union welcomed the move and called on the UK government to follow suit. Dan Shears, GMB health, safety and environment director, said many employers had so far ignored the rule. “Those companies will now need to fall into line or fear the consequences.”
He added: “Where the job of work does mean being closer than 2 metres – nursing, care, education, undertaking to name a few – the guidance will need to give clear principles on how this can be safely done by employers carrying out full risk assessments, identifying the correct PPE [protective personal equipment] and ensuring that it’s given.” Robert Lloyd Griffiths, of the Institute of Directors Wales, said: “Employers should be doing what they can to help stop the spread of the virus.” But he added: “It’s important firms have the support and clear guidance in place to put these rules into practice.”
The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, was among those who has highlighted concerns, saying companies are “nowhere near observing” distancing rules. He said he had been contacted by more than 300 members of the public, highlighting concerns at about 150 companies. The online fashion chain Asos has been criticised by staff who say they are scared to attend work at its distribution centre because they are not being sufficiently protected. The TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “We welcome the action from the Welsh government to improve protection of workers through social distancing. The UK national government must make sure that all UK workers have proper protection, if businesses remain open they must apply the guidelines that have been issued by Public Health England.”"
2020-04-03T14:32:38Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer poised to be announced new Labour leader,"Keir Starmer’s plans to transform the Labour party will be dictated by the scale of his anticipated victory on Saturday, key supporters have said, as senior Jeremy Corbyn supporters expressed concerns they could be purged from key positions. Allies of the former director of public prosecutions say they will be watching to see whether he can achieve an emphatic win before assessing how quickly he can remake the party in his own image, with a clearout of those responsible for the damaging 2019 election defeat. MPs who support Starmer, 57, are hoping that a resounding victory will put pressure on some of the key individuals close to Corbyn to step down. They are said to include Karie Murphy, Corbyn’s chief of staff and one of the election’s directors, and Jennie Formby, the party’s general secretary. One Starmer supporter said: “If Keir wins comfortably among the membership and affiliates on Saturday, the pressure on Murphy and Formby to stand down will be huge. It might not be within the rules, but sometimes the politics overtake the rules.
“We are a democratic, slow-moving organisation and we cannot just throw people out, but one would hope that a big victory would mean they get the message and step down.” The shadow Brexit secretary is favourite to beat Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy to become Labour’s leader, with a decision to be announced at 10.45am on Saturday. Nearly 785,000 party members and affiliated members have voted, according to official figures. Each of the candidates has recorded a victory video to be played if they win. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, is favourite to become deputy leader. The contest comes after a devastating 80-seat general election defeat to Boris Johnson’s Conservatives in December, and an ongoing inquiry into antisemitism within the party conducted by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. In the event of a victory, Starmer’s associates say he will want to get hold of the party’s central structures in Southside, central London, to ensure that staff work with the leader’s office, which is based in parliament. Only the party’s national executive committee (NEC) can remove the party’s general secretary, and it is controlled by Corbyn supporters and their allies. Any attempt to remove Formby, an ally of the Unite leader, Len McCluskey, could result in months of internal wrangles. “If Jennie wishes to stay in post, she can. The last general secretary, Iain McNicol, stuck around for years under Jeremy Corbyn and was accused of undermining him,” said one former Corbyn aide.
A sub-plot to Saturday’s leadership election will be the election of three new members to the NEC. Starmer’s allies are hoping that his supporters will win those posts. If Starmer wins, he will also be able to remove three Corbyn appointees to the NEC - Long-Bailey, Jon Trickett and Diane Abbott - and appoint three new shadow frontbench members, which may edge him closer to a majority on the party’s ruling body. It is understood that Labour’s director of communications and strategy, Seumas Milne, a former Guardian columnist, has already informed the party of his plans to stand down. Milne and Murphy, a former aide to Tom Watson and a close friend of McCluskey, are on permanent contracts with the party. Most of those who work for the leader of the opposition are on time-limited contracts that end at the same time as Corbyn’s leadership. Among those tipped for promotion to shadow ministerial positions if Starmer wins are the MP for Tottenham, David Lammy; the Oxford East MP, Anneliese Dodds; and the Birmingham Edgbaston MP, Preet Gill. He would also be expected to keep Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, in position during the coronavirus crisis, and may also keep the shadow leader of the house, Valerie Vaz, and the shadow communities secretary, Andrew Gwynne, on the frontbench. Starmer and his team have held a series of video conferences with up to 50 MPs in recent weeks as his team seeks to bring together different wings of the party. Those who have participated have included Kate Hollern, Corbyn’s former parliamentary private secretary, and the former ministers Angela and Maria Eagle. Tulip Siddiq, the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn and a Starmer ally, said they had been brought together by a desire to win elections, eradicate anti-semitism within the party and stop the in-fighting. “We have to change the structures, drop the factionalism and focus on winning. I don’t think he has an easy task on his hands. Uniting the party will be difficult, making Labour relevant again will be difficult. Winning back the Jewish community will be difficult,” she said. “He’s not the messiah, but it is so important to have a good leader. If we elect him, it will be a start in the right direction.” An associate of Long-Bailey, a Corbyn supporter, said she had run a hard campaign, but conceded that Starmer’s had successfully targeted many of Labour’s “paper” members, who rarely attend meetings. “If we can push the contest to second preferences, that would be a reasonable achievement,” the associate said. Starmer’s personal team would be likely to include Morgan McSweeney as chief of staff. Ben Nunn, his current spokesman, would become director of communications. Claire Ainsley of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, who used to work for Unite, would serve as director of policy. Starmer has also approached Helene Reardon Bond, Corbyn’s office manager and a former senior civil servant. She could serve as deputy chief of staff. Murphy and Formby were approached via Labour for a comment. Starmer’s spokesperson declined to comment."
2020-04-03T13:57:46Z,politics,Politics,Britain’s coronavirus testing scandal: a timeline of mixed messages,"Three weeks ago, the World Health Organization told countries battling Covid-19 to “test, test, test” for the virus. Since then, the UK government has been accused of issuing mixed messages, of over-promising and under-delivering – the UK’s daily testing rate has only just passed 10,000. 11 March: Tests to be expanded The health secretary, Matt Hancock, insists the government is “rolling out a big expansion of testing” but declines to give a specific timetable. NHS England says there are plans to increase coronavirus testing to 10,000. The UK-wide death toll stands at eight – 1,215 people have been tested for coronavirus in the UK. 12 March: Tests to be restricted The UK moves from the “contain” to the “delay” phase of its plan to tackle coronavirus. Boris Johnson announces that health workers will no longer test people for the virus in their homes, but will continue to test people already in hospitals. 16 March: WHO says ‘test, test, test’ The WHO urges countries to “test, test, test”. 3,826 people have been tested for coronavirus in the UK. 18 March: ‘Test 25,000 a day’ – but no timetable Boris Johnson announces the ambition of carrying out 25,000 tests a day, but provides no detail. 5,779 tests are carried out that day. 19 March: ‘Antibody tests coming soon’ – but no timetable The prime minister says mass testing to see if people have already contracted the virus, and are probably therefore immune, will take place relatively soon, which he says would be a game-changer. The UK death toll from coronavirus stands at 144. 24 March: ‘UK has 3.5m antibody tests’ – but no timetable Matt Hancock announces the government has bought 3.5m antibody tests, which can determine if someone has had coronavirus. He repeats that general testing will be ramped up, but with no timeframe for deployment. 6,491 tests are performed. 25 March: ‘UK aiming for 250,000 tests a day’ – but no timetable Johnson tells the daily Downing Street press conference: “We are going up from 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day, to 25,000, hopefully very soon up to 250,000 per day.” 6,583 tests are carried out. 25 March: ‘Antibody tests within days’ – then denied Earlier that day, Prof Sharon Peacock, the director of the national infection service at PHE, says mass antibody testing in the UK will be possible within days. The government later takes a more cautious line, saying the tests will not be available so quickly. 27 March: ‘Dramatic increase planned’ – but no timetable Michael Gove announces that a “new alliance” of businesses, research institutes and universities will boost antigen testing capacity (which checks if someone has the virus) for frontline workers. He says hundreds of people will receive the tests over the weekend and that there will be a “dramatic” increase in testing the following week. 31 March: ‘Testing hampered by chemical shortage’ Only 8,240 people are tested on this day. Gove says the availability of certain chemicals is limiting the ability to rapidly increase testing capacity. 1 April – Ministers admit only 0.4% of NHS staff have been tested Despite its 27 March announcement, Downing Street confirms that only 2,000 people out of 500,000 frontline NHS England workers had been tested for coronavirus so far. Public Health England’s Prof Yvonne Doyle appears to confirm that the UK’s strategy is now to increase testing for the virus in the general population. A total of 9,793 tests are carried out. 2 April: Government sets new target – and admits 3.5m antibody tests don’t work Testing passes 10,000 a day for the first time since the start of the crisis, with 10,215 carried out. Hancock sets a new government target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April – including both antibody and antigen tests. He says the UK wants to buy 17.5m antibody tests, “subject to them working”, and that early tests had been “poor”. None of the 3.5m tests bought by the government – and announced on 24 March – have been found to work so far. 3 April: 100,000 target clarified Hancock tells broadcasters that the prime minister’s 25 March commitment to get to 250,000 tests a day “still stands”, but that he wanted to “put a very clear timeline” on the goal to get to 100,000 by the end of the month. He says it is “frustrating” that the first antibody tests have not worked. The prime minister’s spokesman is forced to clarify that the 100,000 target is for England only."
2020-04-03T13:44:13Z,politics,Politics,Coronavirus symptoms force Boris Johnson to stay in self-isolation,"Boris Johnson is continuing his self-isolation inside Downing Street after the initial seven-day period because he is still showing symptoms of coronavirus. The UK prime minister has a temperature, and in a video clip released on his Twitter account said he would continue to stay inside his flat at No 11 until it disappears.
The health secretary, Matt Hancock, who announced last Friday that he also had the illness, is now out of isolation. Johnson said: “Although I’m feeling better and I’ve done my seven days of isolation alas I still have one of the minor symptoms, I still have a temperature. “So in accordance with government advice I must continue my isolation until that symptom itself goes. But we’re working clearly the whole time on our programme to defeat the virus.”
Johnson announced last Friday that he had tested positive for coronavirus. He had felt unwell the day before and took a test in the afternoon. On Thursday 26 March, he had appeared alongside the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in Downing Street to take part in the first clap for carers at 8pm. He got the test result at midnight and went into isolation, with the doorways between No 10 and No 12 sealed off. Hancock is assumed to have self-isolated a full 24 hours before he made his positive diagnosis public on the same day as the PM, meaning he got back to work publicly on Thursday – taking the daily press conference. The prime minister’s official spokesman said Johnson had only mild symptoms of the illness and that he chaired the morning coronavirus meeting with ministers and officials. “He does continue to have mild symptoms, in particular a temperature,” he said. “The guidance is clear that if you still have a high temperature you keep self-isolating until it returns to normal.”
He did not give details on how high his temperature was or whether he had been checked over by a doctor. The UK guidance to isolate for seven days is produced by the chief medical officer and Public Health England. The World Health Organization has said someone could be infectious beyond their symptoms so should isolate for a full two weeks. “Our guidance … is very clear on what you need to do and the PM is following it,” the spokesman said. On Friday, the government reinforced its warnings that people should stay at home this weekend even if they are tempted to go further afield because of the forecasted warmer weather, particularly on Sunday. Johnson said in his video on Twitter: “I reckon people will be starting to think that this is going on for quite a long time and they would rather be getting out there, particularly if they’ve got kids in the household. Everybody may be getting a bit stir crazy.
“There maybe just a temptation to get out there, hang out and start to break the regulations. I just urge you not to do that. Please, please stick with the guidance now.”"
2020-04-03T13:17:30Z,politics,Politics,John McDonnell calls for wealth tax to pay for coronavirus measures,"John McDonnell has called for a wealth tax on the richest in society and a windfall levy on the banking industry to fund the government’s emergency response to the coronavirus crisis, as the social and economic costs of the outbreak rapidly mount. In his final act as shadow chancellor before Labour elects a new leader on Saturday, McDonnell said the rebuilding job for Britain after Covid-19 should prioritise fully funded, publicly owned and democratically controlled public services. Writing exclusively in the Guardian before he is expected to retire to the back benches of the Commons, McDonnell said the rapidly rising cost to the public purse of the escalating global health pandemic needed to be borne by those with the broadest shoulders. “We pay for it by introducing an immediate windfall tax on the banks and finance sector we bailed out when they brought about the crisis a decade ago,” he said, adding that it should be combined with a wealth tax on the richest within our society, and a tax on multinationals. “We can demonstrate, just as the current government has demonstrated, that when we need the resources they can always be found.” With Britain on the brink of the deepest global recession since the second world war amid the coronavirus crisis, economists have warned that government borrowing is set to surge as the economy crashes. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned that public borrowing could balloon to more than £200bn, outstripping in cash terms the budget deficit Britain was left with after the 2008 financial crisis. The government has promised to pay 80% of the wages of workers and most of the self-employed, as well as offering billions of pounds of support to British companies, despite intense criticism that serious gaps remain in its plan. Warning against the use of austerity to balance the books once the dust settles on the Covid-19 outbreak, McDonnell said Britain needed to embark on a decade-long programme of intensive government investment to stage a fightback from the current crisis. Faced with the challenges of global heating and entrenched inequalities in Britain leading up to the pandemic, he said investment in infrastructure to end the country’s dependence on fossil fuels and greater steps to share wealth would be urgently needed. “If we are to build the resilience needed to cope with any further waves of this virus, or other future unknown threats, our new society needs to be built on fully funded, publicly owned and democratically controlled public services,” he said.
The shadow chancellor said the crisis had highlighted the vital importance of the public sector and the need for a stronger safety net to safeguard people’s lives and livelihoods – shown by the way the political dogma of the Conservatives had been ditched as the crisis intensified. “As we enter possibly a longer and more distressing period of this pandemic, we must give people hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel and that together we can make it a bright one. We will never let our eyes become accustomed to the dark,” he added."
2020-04-03T12:58:28Z,politics,Politics,Jeremy Corbyn's wife Laura Alvarez hits out at critics on his last day,"Laura Alvarez, the wife of Jeremy Corbyn, has said she regrets Labour failed to “pull together” to win elections, condemning the media and his opponents in the party on his last day as leader of the party. In a rare public statement, Alvarez said it had been “incredibly hard” for her to watch her husband vilified by the media and even harder to watch him be attacked by his own party.
“The brutal irony is that if we had pulled together, we would have been ready to lead the country rather than suffer more austerity under the Tories,” she wrote in the Mirror. “My greatest wish ahead of the 2017 general election was that the party would stay together so that we could beat them. Unfortunately, my wish was not granted and I will forever think of that lost moment when we were so close to winning for the people of the United Kingdom.” Corbyn is due to step down after five years as Labour leader on Saturday. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, is widely expected to win the race to replace him, which started – unofficially – after December’s general election, in which the party won its lowest number of seats since 1935. Voting opened in the competition on 24 February and closed on Thursday. The three candidates – Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy – have been asked to pre-record victory speeches to be issued as soon as the result is announced. Alvarez said: “It has been incredibly hard for me to watch my husband vilified and to hear his words twisted by his political opponents and some in the media. It has been even harder to watch him be attacked by his own party.” The human rights lawyer said Corbyn had told her the first thing he would do if he became prime minister after the 2019 election was to spend more money on the NHS. “I read about the work that our amazing heroes in the NHS are doing during the coronavirus outbreak and only wish that the investment our health service needs had been offered long before now,” she said. Alvarez said it had been the privilege of her life to meet people across the country as part of Corbyn’s work as Labour leader. “We are all part of the cosmos and we all have a part to play in rebuilding our movement.” She thanked people who voted for Labour and supported her husband, and urged the party not to lose sight of its “commitment to socialism and the policies of the manifesto”. “We know you shared our values. If equality, humanity, honesty and kindness is called Corbynism, then that’s all right with me,” she said."
2020-04-03T05:00:10Z,politics,Politics,"Next Labour leader should back sweeping electoral reforms, Greens say","Labour’s leadership candidates should back sweeping reforms of the UK’s electoral system and pledge to bring in proportional representation if elected, the Green party has urged. Siân Berry and Jonathan Bartley, co-leaders of the Green party, have written to the three candidates offering support and dialogue “in the collegiate spirit these times demand” and asking each of them to endorse a shift to a form of PR voting. “We cannot continue to allow our democracy to be warped by a system where many are excluded, policy is not led by those whose voices should be heard, and where votes do not match seats,” they say. Three-quarters of Labour party members support proportional representation, according to a YouGov poll conducted shortly after last December’s general election, which produced Labour’s worst showing since 1935. But the party has fought shy of wholeheartedly adopting the policy. The Labour leadership campaign, muted in its final weeks by the coronavirus crisis, closed on Thursday and the winner among the final three candidates – frontrunner Sir Keir Starmer, the pro-Corbyn Rebecca Long-Bailey and outsider Lisa Nandy – will be announced on Saturday. Berry told the Guardian the Covid-19 emergency had highlighted the problems with the first-past-the-post system, which is predicated on two-party dominance. She said the crisis meant voters wanted their elected representatives to work together, but the system discourages cooperation. “Fairer political systems force politicians to move away from point-scoring rivalries and tribalism, and leads to better outcomes,” she said. “The evidence on this spans health, income inequality, quality of life, environmental protections and education, and even shows countries [with fairer electoral systems] tend to have lower levels of national debt and lower deficits.” The climate crisis, which all three Labour candidates have promised to prioritise, was a key example of a vital issue that cut across traditional party lines, but on which cooperation had been stifled by the current system, she said. “Just like coronavirus, there is no way we are going to be able to tackle the climate emergency without working together, and the outdated first-past-the-post system is seriously hindering our ability to do that.” All three Labour candidates have indicated support for electoral reform, without giving detailed plans. Starmer has called for a new constitutional convention to address issues including “the fact that millions of people vote in safe seats and feel their voice doesn’t count”. Long-Bailey has also backed a constitutional convention without explicitly recommending PR for the House of Commons, and Nandy has voiced some support but stopped short of full backing. Labour voters would win as well as the Green party from a new voting system, according to Berry. Despite a 2.7% share of the vote at the last election, the Greens still managed only one MP, Caroline Lucas, in Brighton Pavilion. Under the form of proportional representation used in European parliament elections, the Greens would have taken 12 seats. Labour, with 32% of the vote, would have taken 14 more seats than its 202 tally and the Conservatives’ 80-seat majority would have evaporated. “All voters benefit from a fairer electoral system, no matter which party they support, because if votes match seats then people’s views really matter and our democracy is strengthened,” said Berry. Support for smaller parties is artificially suppressed under first-past-the-post, as voters choose the least-worst option if they feel their preferred candidate has little chance of winning. The experience of the coronavirus crisis will increase people’s appetite for a fairer electoral system, Berry believes, giving the next Labour leader the opportunity to make sweeping changes to the party’s approach. She drew a parallel between workers who have often been undervalued in pay and by governments, and voters who do not feel they have much influence on politicians. “The huge change in attitude about which workers do the jobs that really keep our society going – not just NHS staff but the teachers, supermarket workers, delivery drivers, care workers and many other jobs that were undervalued before – is a new perspective we must not forget. I hope people will keep these values in mind [after the crisis wanes],” she said. “It is vital that the public trust their votes count and their voices will be heard.”"
2020-04-02T21:30:01Z,politics,Politics,UK banks banned from requesting personal guarantees for loans,"The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has banned banks from requesting personal guarantees for emergency loans to small businesses amid growing government concern that lenders have been slow in meeting demands for help. With the rapid increase in the number of universal credit claims suggesting many small companies have already collapsed since the economy was locked down, Sunak combined a new package of support for business with a warning to banks that they had to move more quickly. Sunak announced his £330bn coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) – under which the government underwrites loans to companies – just over two weeks ago, but has now been forced to admit that support was not arriving quickly enough and was failing to reach all the companies that required it. The chancellor said that under the revised plan: Lenders would be banned from requesting personal guarantees – which mean borrowers often have to put their homes on the line – on loans under £250,000. The loan scheme would be extended so that it covered all small companies affected by Covid-19 and not just those unable to get commercial funding. There would be a new scheme to bolster support for larger firms not currently eligible for loans, under which the government would provide a guarantee of 80% so that banks could make loans of up to £25m to firms with an annual turnover of between £45m and £500m. The Treasury said the chancellor would be speaking to bank chief executives next week to discuss how the schemes are working and “ensure everybody is playing their part”. Sunak, the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, and the interim head of the Financial Conduct Authority, Christopher Woolard, told UK banking chiefs last month to take “all action necessary” to make sure government-backed loans were benefiting households and businesses as planned. The chancellor said: “This is a national effort and we’ll continue to work with the financial services sector to ensure that the £330bn of government support, through loans and guarantees, reaches as many businesses in need as possible.” While the government’s official line is that great progress is being made in providing much-needed support to businesses that have been badly affected by the closure of large chunks of the economy, the chancellor has listened to the employers’ bodies calling for the scheme to be more comprehensive, less bureaucratic and speedier. Adam Marshall, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “We’re pleased that the chancellor is listening and responding to the real-world concerns posed by firms across the UK who are urgently trying to access financial support.” Mike Cherry, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “The most immediate issue threatening the survival of millions of small businesses and the self-employed is severely depleted cash flow. Time is of the essence and therefore we welcome government action in ensuring that any viable small business that has been negatively impacted by the coronavirus can now directly access CBILS rather first being offered a bank’s own standard commercial lending product. “Removing personal guarantees for all commercial loans below £250k is also very welcome. Taking on debt at the current time is a daunting prospect for many small businesses and the self-employed.” Sunak said that since the CBILS had been announced £90m of business interruption loans had been approved for nearly 1,000 firms and £1.9bn corporate finance provided to firms hit by Covid-19. “We are making great progress on getting much-needed support out to businesses to help manage their cashflows during this difficult time – with millions of pounds of loans and finance being provided to hundreds of firms across the country,” the chancellor said. “And now I am taking further action by extending our generous loan scheme so even more businesses can benefit. We have also listened to the concerns of some larger businesses affected by Covid-19 and are announcing new support so they can benefit too.” Gerard Lyons, senior fellow at the Policy Exchange thinktank and a policy adviser to Boris Johnson when he was London’s mayor, said: “In a fast-moving environment it should be no surprise that policy has to continue to evolve. Speed, scale and simplicity are of the utmost importance to follow through on the measures to date. In particular banks either must engage 100% in the process or be bypassed with the government giving grants to firms to ensure they survive.”"
2020-04-02T20:14:27Z,politics,Politics,No 10 seeks to end coronavirus lockdown with 'immunity passports',"No 10 is facing fresh questions over its coronavirus testing plan, as it emerged that the government is hoping to exit the lockdown through controversial “immunity passports” and antibody tests that are still not proven to work. In the face of intense criticism, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, on Thursday admitted for the first time that mistakes had been made. “There will be criticisms made, and some of them will be justified,” he told the daily press briefing. Hancock revealed that certificates to prove someone is immune to the virus could allow some of the population to go back to work, as he made a new pledge to complete 100,000 tests a day in England by the end of the month. He attempted to relaunch the government’s strategy while Boris Johnson remains unwell in self-isolation, after a week of pressure about why so few tests are being carried out, especially on NHS workers. Hancock promised that tests would be expanded from hospital patients and medics to more NHS staff, key workers and finally more people in the community. These will be a combination of tests for live cases of the virus and antibody tests to determine whether someone has previously been infected. Germany is carrying out around 70,000 tests a day, all for live cases of Covid-19. However, the government was also forced to acknowledge it was not likely to have the capacity to embark on a programme of mass testing for live cases in the general public, as advocated by the World Health Organization and public experts.
Instead, No 10 and health department sources confirmed the general public would primarily have to rely on the potential for an antibody test – but these are “ideally” done 28 days after an infection, to give the clearest indication of whether someone has already had the virus, according to Prof John Newton, a senior Public Health England official. Newton said the idea of testing all those that have symptoms in the country was “unrealistic” and the as yet unproven antibody test was more likely to be used by people at home. Hancock said work was progressing with the antibody tests but that the results of many of the early tests had been “poor” and he was more hopeful about later ones that have been acquired. The government has bought options on up to 17.5m antibody tests of different types that are currently being tested, but cannot say definitively when they will be safe to use. When the antibody tests are available, Hancock said, the government was looking at the possibility of issuing immunity certificates, so that some of the population “can get back to work as much as possible”. However, some critics fear that this could lead to resentment in the population who have not had the virus, and that people might even deliberately try to get infected in order to obtain an immunity certificate. Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, told the Guardian that immunity certificates for frontline medical workers would be crucial for allowing staff to return to work and allowing personal protective equipment to be rationed in the safest way. However, in the wider population, fraud could be an issue, which could rule out home-based testing, and there were concerns about unintended consequences. “People going out to deliberately get infected so they could get back to work is a concern and I don’t know how you’d avoid that,” he said. “Those are big issues.” After a week spent in isolation with coronavirus himself, Hancock was forced to defend the government on numerous fronts. He told the press briefing: Johnson’s ultimate target of 250,000 tests a day – first made on March 18 - was still valid. Premiership footballers should take a pay cut in solidarity with NHS workers who are putting their lives on the line. Shortages of swabs had been rectified, but the UK was “still tackling the reagents issue, which is a global challenge”. The UK was having to build its capacity from a “lower base” than the likes of Germany, which is testing around 70,000 people per day. More commercial laboratories, including universities and private businesses, would be used to accelerate testing after criticism that this “Dunkirk” approach had initially been ignored. The NHS will have £13.4bn of debt written off, as previously confirmed. Tensions have bubbled in Whitehall over who is to blame for low testing numbers in the UK, with some political sources blaming Public Health England (PHE) for not placing enough emphasis on the issue in recent weeks. However, PHE rejected criticism that it had been trying to do all the testing itself and was too inflexible in which chemicals were allowed to be used, suggesting that it was the responsibility of ministers to find private capacity for more tests. Prof Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director of the public health body, said PHE’s role was to “make sure our labs are doing what they need to do” in terms of testing hospital patients with a clinical need, with NHS staff a second priority. Conservative backbenchers voiced concern in private about the government’s failure to roll out testing faster, saying there was anxiety that the public mood could turn against the government if it appeared there was no end to the lockdown as a result. A former supporter Johnson in the leadership contest said they were worried sentiment could turn rapidly: “I think the government could get blown away if people are still inside after Easter and there is no progress on testing.” Concerns were voiced that Johnson and other ministers had appeared to allow PHE to lead on testing, without asking the independent researchers and the private sector to get involved until Hancock’s announcement. “The fact that there’s not mass testing now is inexcusable,” another Conservative MP complained. One senior MP said the party would be watching the polls closely and that he was “frankly amazed” that Johnson’s popularity was holding up. A bit like the virus, there might be a two-week lag before the public comes to fully realise that the government is failing to get the testing issue under control, they said. “There are some in my party who are trying to blame PHE, but ultimately, it will be the politicians who get the blame if the economy collapses because we can’t test NHS workers. “The death toll will become totemic. If we get thousands of people dying every day for several days, who knows where this will go. It is frightening, and the prime minister looks like he doesn’t know what to do.” Jeremy Corbyn, the outgoing Labour leader, said: “The fact that we are not yet even testing 10,000 people a day is very, very serious indeed. There are almost half a million [frontline] people working in the NHS and the care sector. Even they have not yet been tested. It is ludicrous. We have got to get on top of testing.”"
2020-04-02T20:01:22Z,politics,Politics,'A glimmer of hope but little detail': experts react to Hancock's test plan,"Anthony Costello, former WHO director and professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London On virus testing, it is good that they are solving the swabs and reagents issues. It’s good that they are galvanising the scientific community to help and it’s good that they are setting a target for 25,000 tests [antigen tests that show if people have the virus] per day by the end of April [Hancock aspires to reach 100,000 a day in England for all types of tests, including antibody tests] that will hopefully help to cover health workers and patients. If the blood tests for immunity come online, that will be a very valuable tool for looking at the scale of immunity in the population, as will their surveillance plan from Porton Down, to look at the rates of infection and spread in a sample survey. Whether or not the immunity blood tests will be sufficiently specific for Covid-19 is a big issue, because if they give out false positives, it will be dangerous for people believing themselves to be immune to go back into the front line and infect patients. Nonetheless, none of these strategies address the fundamental problem of stopping the spread of the virus. Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh Under normal circumstances, Public Health England (PHE) (and Health Protection Scotland) have extremely strict testing protocols, all validated to the highest certification standards. This has many benefits: providing robust results in which clinicians have complete faith, aligning to standard criteria that allow national and international comparison, and regular revalidation of individual laboratories. On a normal day this works. It is clinically robust and allows the NHS to benefit by bulk-ordering reagents from a single supplier at a competitive price. But these are not normal times. There is an urgent need to scale up testing. This might require that we adapt protocols to use whichever reagents and equipment are available. Research labs, which tend to operate in a less regimented manner, have the skills, equipment and (quite possibly) sufficient reagents to contribute to this effort. They won’t be exactly the same items that PHE use, but they will work just as well. Crucially, almost all academic research that is not related to Covid-19 has been put on hold; the labs have been mothballed and the staff sent home. This represents a tremendous available resource for outsourcing and scaling up the testing. The academic community has the skills, resources and willingness to contribute if only someone would take the sensible, pragmatic decision to cede a little control. There is a glimmer of hope in Matt Hancock’s “5 pillar programme” presented at the press briefing today, but still precious little detail. Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health, University of Southampton It is good to finally hear the explanation from the minister of health about the difficulties in scaling up testing. This is down to a lack of preparedness in advance of a pandemic, which then impacts upon the ability to greatly and rapidly increase a national response, as we have seen in Germany. These are issues also being faced in other countries – for example, France has carried out fewer tests than the UK. The minister has promised 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. We shall see if this level is delivered. But throughout the coming weeks, we need to remember the lessons learned and realise that spare capacity in a health service or public health infrastructure is not “a waste of money”. It’s vital in times of urgent need, and there will be a “next time”. Mark Harris, professor of virology at the University of Leeds [Hancock’s five pillars] seems like the right approach. I am a little bit concerned about the timescale, that we are having to wait to the end of April [for high levels of testing]. We would hope that within the next few weeks we would start to see some effects of the social distancing and the lockdown, so it would be nicer if we could be testing quicker than that. But I understand what [Hancock] said about the fact that we didn’t have a big diagnostic industry, unlike some other countries, so we are having to build up from scratch – I think that is quite honest and open of him. [Population sampling] is an excellent way forward. The challenge will be: what population do you sample? Also, what is the statistical analysis will you apply to the data you get from that? If you went into London, you’d probably find there is a much higher proportion [of infection] than other parts of the country – maybe that is information that we need to know. I think we can always be critical of what has happened in the past, but I don’t think that is appropriate at this stage. This is a crisis and we are where we are. We need to try to make sure that going forward we are doing the right things; the time for recrimination and looking back and learning the lessons will be in the future. For now I think [Hancock] is doing everything he can. Let’s hope those words that were spoken today are actually translated into actions over the coming few days. Charlie Swanton, chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, who is setting up a testing lab in the Francis Crick Institute It all sounds very sensible. Testing is absolutely essential to get healthcare workers back to the front line, when they don’t present a risk to those around them and to patients. With a significant proportion of the workforce off right now with presumed coronavirus infection, having tests will be vital to frontline services already stretched because of the crisis. The sensible thing would be to staff coronavirus units with doctors and nurses who have had exposure to coronavirus, and that’s why the antibody test is so important. We’re obviously delighted to be playing a part. We will make a small but significant contribution, we hope. It is going to require collaboration on a national scale. We will be sharing our operating procedures, our assays [investigative procedures] and the development of those assays with other labs upon request very happily and providing training to get people up and running relatively quickly. On building a new British diagnostic industry, this pandemic has exposed the extreme vulnerability of every country. We are so dependent on a globalised diagnostic and clinical network. When the barriers come down and our supply lines fail, it is clear very rapidly how vulnerable we are. We need some way of being able to secure our pipelines to access vital diagnostic reagents and kits and if we can’t, we need some way of manufacturing them ourselves from scratch very quickly. All of this is possible because the technology is not complex. Finding approaches to rapidly validate and qualify a diagnostic test for clinical use is challenging, but solvable with the right networks of collaborators and established diagnostic labs."

2020-04-02T14:00:52Z,politics,Politics,"Ease rules on research into psychedelic drugs, urges David Nutt","Restrictions on the use of psychedelic drugs in research should be relaxed to help find new treatments for conditions including mental health disorders, the former government adviser Prof David Nutt has said. Nutt was sacked as chair of the advisory committee on the misuse of drugs in October 2009 over his views that ecstasy and LSD are less dangerous than alcohol. He said the potential benefits of psychedelics – first suggested from research in the 1950s and 60s – were failing to be properly explored because of draconian regulations imposed for political reasons. While heroin and psilocybin (the active compound in magic mushrooms) are both class A drugs, only the latter is a “schedule 1” controlled drug – a category of drugs deemed to have no medical value.
“The implication is if you want to use [psychedelics] you must be doing something naughty, even though it is research,” said Nutt. He said the upshot was that research into drugs such as psilocybin involved an expensive and lengthy bureaucratic process to gain licences, and it was also difficult to gain ethical approval. “You’ve got to get permissions, multiple permissions from the Home Office, and they include inspections,” he told the Guardian, adding that transporting such drugs required special couriers and extensive documentation, and higher levels of security were required than for other drugs that are more harmful. “A lot of research isn’t done because people just can’t be arsed to go through the rigmarole of getting the licence,” he added. Despite the tight restrictions, some new research is being conducted, including by Nutt and his team who have conducted brain scans on people who are tripping on LSD. Writing in the journal Cell, Nutt and colleagues outline evidence suggesting that psilocybin could be a powerful form of therapy for conditions ranging from depression to anorexia. “Both the depression and tobacco smoking trials have shown that in some people psilocybin can produce clinical remission, in some cases persisting for years,” the team write, adding that they are now working on a trial comparing psilocybin with the antidepressant escitalopram in major depressive disorder. Nutt and colleagues say psychedelics are thought to produce such results by disrupting activity in the brain involved in habits of thought and behaviour, possibly by interacting with a receptor predominately found in the cerebral cortex of the brain called 5-HT2A. They say that disruption can not only help individuals gain insights into their conditions during the trip but also provide a window of opportunity in the days that follow, while the participant is experiencing an “afterglow” and thinking differently, for them to engage better with psychotherapy. However, the team note many questions remain, including how long a trip needs to last for benefits to be seen, whether so-called “microdosing” with the drugs – where levels are so low that there is no trip – could be beneficial, and why some patients relapse after psychedelic therapy. In the meantime, with psychedelics legal in some parts of the world, the team are hoping to collect data on people’s experiences through an online survey.
Nutt cautioned against people using psychedelics for self-medication, noting that participants in trials were prepared for the trip, and the psychedelics were administered in the presence of therapists. “Our depressed patients almost always have a very tough trip and we don’t think they’d be safe having a trip like that in the middle of a field or in their own bedroom without professional care,” he said, adding the psychotherapy afterwards was also important to gain benefits. Ultimately, said Nutt, the schedule 1 restrictions on psychedelics need to change. “We have been arguing for years there should be exemption for research,” he said. “That magic mushrooms can be alongside crack cocaine in [class A] is absurd, but even worse is the putting it in schedule 1 so you can’t use [psychedelics] for research.”"
2020-04-02T13:48:58Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson still has Covid-19 symptoms and may stay in isolation,"Boris Johnson is still displaying coronavirus symptoms, meaning he may not be able to leave No 11 Downing Street on Friday, where he is self-isolating. The prime minister’s official spokesman said Johnson was still symptomatic, six days after he first came down with signs of the illness. If he still has a temperature on Friday, he will not be able to leave quarantine as planned, despite having observed a recommended seven days in isolation. The spokesman said: “What the guidelines say is that if you still have a high temperature, for example, you should keep self-isolating until your temperature returns to normal. The guidance is that you should stay at home for seven days or for longer if a high temperature persists.”
When asked if the prime minister had a temperature, the spokesman said only that he continued to have “mild symptoms”. Johnson has been leading the response to coronavirus from No 11 by video conference with other key ministers and officials for almost a week. His chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, also continues to work from self-isolation and did not provide an update on his condition. However, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, will leave self-isolation on Thursday after seven days of being in quarantine. He is expected to give a press conference in No 10 setting out a new “action plan” for testing for coronavirus, after a backlash against the government’s poor testing numbers. A No 10 spokesman said the government “acknowledges that more needs to be done and we need to make progress quickly” in relation to testing NHS staff, with 2,800 undergoing tests so far out of 500,000 frontline workers.
Downing Street also confirmed the government was looking at the idea of “immunity passports” to allow some people who have had coronavirus to leave the lockdown. The spokesman said: “That’s something other countries have done. We are always watching what other countries are doing and looking to learn.”"
2020-04-02T12:45:20Z,politics,Politics,UK government in row with EU over proposed office in Belfast,"The British government has rejected an EU request to open an office in Belfast, in the first major row over the implementation of the post-Brexit Irish border protocol. The EU closed its offices across the UK when the country left the bloc on 31 January, but its officials have a right to be present to monitor the checks and controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea. The Foreign Office has rejected Brussels’ request for a permanent physical presence in Belfast on the grounds this would go beyond what is stipulated in the withdrawal agreement. There are concerns it would be seen by some as a step towards joint policing of the customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The British government fought during negotiations over the withdrawal agreement to ensure that checks and controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea would not be jointly carried out. The row highlights the potential for the protocol on Northern Ireland to be a cause of contention between the EU and UK in the months to come.
Under the withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland effectively stays in the single market. It also remains within the UK’s customs territory to allow it to benefit from any future trade deals secured by the British government. But the full EU customs code has to be enforced on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. All goods deemed at risk of travelling from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland would attract tariffs. The messy compromise allowed for the avoidance of a border on the island of Ireland but brings with it a host of potential flash points. The issue of a Belfast office was raised on Monday during the first teleconference meeting of the EU-UK joint committee, set up to supervise the operation of the withdrawal agreement. The chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, is the UK’s senior figure on the committee. Under article 12 of the Northern Ireland protocol, the UK government is “responsible for implementing and applying the provisions of [EU] law” but EU officials “shall have the right to be present during any activities” relating to checks and controls. The UK is obliged to “facilitate such presence of representatives and shall provide them with the information requested”. The EU wants a base for its customs and veterinary experts. A European commission spokesman said: “We can confirm that we have sent letters to the UK regarding a proposal to open a technical office in Belfast with specific technical capabilities to ensure the implementation of the protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland. This issue was raised in the joint committee on Monday. We remain in contact with the UK on this point.” A cross-party group of members of the Northern Ireland assembly has written to the prime minister backing the commission’s proposal. Michelle O’Neill of Sinn Féin, who is the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, along with the leaders of the Greens, the Social Democratic and Labour party and the Northern Ireland Alliance, wrote: “As party leaders representing a majority of citizens who voted to remain within the EU, we feel strongly that an office in Belfast is necessary to ensure the implementation of the protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland which you negotiated with the EU … “To oppose the opening of such an office by the EU in Belfast represents an act of bad faith by your government and a breach of trust at this critical stage of the process.” A spokesman for the UK government said it was considering the issue. He said: “We received an initial request from the EU and responded to decline the proposal in February. We have since received a follow-up letter to which we will respond in due course.”"
2020-04-02T08:54:03Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson restates pledge to boost UK coronavirus testing capacity,"Boris Johnson has promised again to ramp up capacity to test for coronavirus, amid a blame game over why small private laboratories across the country have not been enlisted in a “Dunkirk” approach. The prime minister said more testing was “the way through” the crisis, as Whitehall sources described frustration within the government that Public Health England (PHE) had not placed enough emphasis on the issue in recent weeks. However, PHE rejected criticism that it had been trying to do all the testing itself and was too inflexible in which chemicals were allowed to be used, suggesting it was the responsibility of ministers to find private capacity for more tests. Prof Paul Cosford, the emeritus medical director of the public health body, said PHE’s role was to “make sure what our labs are doing what they need to do” in terms of testing hospital patients with a clinical need, with NHS staff a second priority. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme it was the Office for Life Sciences – part of the Department of Health and Social Care under Matt Hancock – that was working on private-sector capacity to test more widely, and this could boost capacity to “at least 100,000 tests a day, hopefully more”. The UK has been testing fewer than 10,000 people a day, lagging far behind other nations such as Germany, and the prime minister has had to address mounting anger about the situation. Ministers have consistently failed to explain fully why testing has not been not higher and are facing questions about why they are not planning to roll out mass testing for the virus beyond hospital patients and NHS workers. There are some signs of a split emerging within the government over whether testing on a huge scale should be the ultimate goal to help suppress the virus and end the lockdown. Jonathan Van Tam, a deputy chief medical officer at Public Health England, told ITV’s Peston programme on Wednesday that testing was “a bit of a side issue”. He said: “What’s important is the social distancing, stopping people coming into contact, so that the rate of new cases slows.”
But in a video message posted on Twitter on Wednesday evening, Johnson said the UK needed to “massively ramp up” capacity for the two separate tests that show whether people have or have had the disease. He said testing was “how we unlock the coronavirus puzzle”. Johnson said: “It’s crucial people who do have the disease are able to be tested positive and to take the necessary steps to isolate at home in the way that I am doing and many, many others are doing.” Private facilities at universities, charities and businesses have offered to help increase the numbers of tests being carried out. Sir Paul Nurse, the chief executive of the Francis Crick Institute, said its research laboratory had been repurposed so it could carry out Covid-19 tests at a rate of 500 a day by next week, rising to 2,000 a day in future. He told the Today programme: “We hope that we can roll this out to other research institutes so that everybody can contribute.” Nurse added: “A metaphor here is Dunkirk: we are a lot of little boats and the little boats can be effective. The government has put some big boats – destroyers – in place. That’s a bit more cumbersome to get working and we wish them all the luck to do that, but we little boats can contribute as well.” He said tests could be turned around in less than 24 hours, which could help get NHS staff back on the frontline. Scientists have called on health officials to abandon strict production rules that are hampering the introduction of mass testing for coronavirus, after the government admitted that just 2,000 out of half a million frontline NHS staff had been tested to date.
Guidelines drawn up by PHE describe the chemicals and equipment that must be used to test patients. But with some reagents in short supply, senior researchers told the Guardian that the UK must find alternatives to avoid more delays. Prof Nicola Stonehouse, a molecular virologist at Leeds University, said efforts to scale up testing were being frustrated by over-reliance on specified reagents, enzymes and other chemicals. “If we could get over this, we could get the testing centres up and running so much faster, and that’s got to be a good thing,” she said. “The NHS have very specific requirements, and there is good reason for that. It makes sure that standards are maintained. But there are alternatives. They need to be optimised and validated, but you can fast-track that if you have enough people. It wouldn’t take a lot of time.”"
2020-04-01T19:07:15Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus testing: what ministers said and what has happened,"Over the past fortnight, ministers and their scientific advisers have made a series of claims over testing. Which of them stand up to scrutiny? Claim: UK coronavirus testing will reach 100,000 per day Reality: Amid criticism that the UK was lagging badly behind other countries, Boris Johnson declared in March that coronavirus testing would increase to 25,000 tests a day, with NHS frontline staff being among the first to benefit. At the start of April, testing was well short of the interim goal of 10,000 tests a day, with only 2,000 of about half a million NHS frontline workers having been tested. As a result, scores of NHS staff have been self-isolating without knowing if it is safe for them to return to work. On Thursday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, set out a goal of moving from 10,000 tests a day to 100,000 by the end of April. This would include swab testing in Public Health England and NHS labs, using commercial partners including universities and private businesses, and introducing antibody blood tests.
Claim: testing is being held up by a shortage of reagents Reality: As nations scramble to scale up testing, the global suppliers of key chemicals called reagents are struggling to meet demand. According to the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, companies are working flat out to boost their supply but are having to prioritise where the mixtures are sent. The reagents needed are specific, and different ones are required for different PCR machines – the equipment used to test for the virus by detecting its genetic material. Smaller companies are being consulted about other virus testing strategies. A better pandemic preparedness plan might have foreseen the surge in demand for testing materials and arranged to act swiftly, critics say. To add to the confusion, the Chemical Industries Association, which represents the UK’s very substantial chemicals industry, told ITV News on Tuesday that its members said there was no shortage of the relevant reagents. On Thursday during the daily government briefing, Hancock explained that demand for materials had led to a shortage of both swabs and reagents. The swabs issue had been fixed, he said, but they were still tackling the reagents issue, which is a global challenge.
Claim: home test kits will soon be available Reality: The government has bought millions of home test kits that can show if someone has had the virus and so, hopefully, developed some immunity. But no one has been able to say when the kits will be in circulation. At the end of March, Prof Sharon Peacock, the director of the national infection service at Public Health England, told MPs on the science and technology committee that the finger-prick tests would be evaluated within the week, and that mass testing could start days after. The government later backtracked, saying it would be some time before the tests were available and that blood samples would need to be posted to a laboratory for analysis. The tests look for antibodies to the virus, not the virus itself, so cannot pick up new infections. Hancock said on Thursday that large-scale antibody testing – to see if someone has been infected with the virus and recovered – would be rolled out only when clinicians were confident it was a valid test.
Claim: a bad test is worse than no test Reality: Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, said it was crucial for coronavirus tests to be evaluated carefully because “one thing worse than no test is a bad test”. The reason is simple: a bad test could give an infected doctor the all-clear, sending them back into hospital to spread the virus to colleagues and patients. But some scientists argue that in the crisis, the NHS needs to be more creative and relax its normally stringent rules. NHS test protocols demand specific equipment, enzymes and other chemicals known to produce reliable test results. But with those chemicals and other items in short supply, alternatives can be used to get around the bottleneck and get tests out more quickly. These tests will not be the gold standard the NHS prefers, but with proper evaluation, scientists believe they would be as good."
2020-04-01T19:03:22Z,politics,Politics,UK to set up virtual parliament during coronavirus shutdown,"The government is to set up a virtual parliament to allow MPs to scrutinise its response to the coronavirus crisis following demands from the Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, and opposition parties. The move was announced on Wednesday night amid mounting concerns that the government has failed to get a grip on the crisis, with claims that health workers’ lives are at risk because of a lack of protective equipment and a shortage of tests for the virus. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, announced the move in a statement that said the government and parliament hoped appropriate technology would be in place by 21 April, when MPs are due to return to Westminster. He said: “Parliament’s role of scrutinising government, authorising spending and making laws must be fulfilled and in these unprecedented times that means considering every technological solution available. We are exploring options with the parliamentary authorities in readiness for parliament’s return.”
A source said the plan would be in place by the end of the month. There have been calls from across the political spectrum for MPs to be allowed to scrutinise the government remotely at a time of enormous social upheaval and as freedom of movement is being curtailed by new laws to encourage physical distancing and self-isolation. The government came under pressure to set up a virtual parliament after an unusual intervention by Hoyle on Wednesday. In a letter to Rees-Mogg, the Speaker said MPs should still be able to take part in prime minister’s questions, and put questions to government departments and ministers even if they could not return to Westminster as scheduled on 21 April. Hoyle argued that a trial of virtual select committee hearings had already been successful and he had asked officials to investigate how they would apply similar technology for use in the Commons chamber. Hoyle wrote: “Once the house returns, if we are still in the grip of the crisis where the physical presence of members, or too many members, in the palace is not appropriate, I am keen that they should be able to participate in key parliamentary proceedings virtually, for example oral questions, urgent questions, statements. “The House Service has already trialled some virtual select committee evidence sessions with witnesses, and I have asked officials to investigate how they would apply similar technology to the types of business listed above.”
The Speaker also asked if it would be possible for the government to set up a forum of MPs during the recess, possibly via select committee chairs, who could quiz senior government representatives at set times on different days. “MPs are being swamped right now with questions and casework from distressed constituents who need answers,” he said. “Responses cannot wait for the house to sit again.” A hundred MPs from Labour, the Scottish National party and the Green party wrote a letter last week to the Commons clerk, John Benger, asking for his support in setting up a form of digital parliament. Parliament broke for recess a week early as the number of cases of Covid-19 around Westminster increased. MPs are due back on 21 April."
2020-04-01T18:12:40Z,politics,Politics,Alok Sharma draws the short straw and makes an April fool of himself | John Crace,"Well, it could have gone worse. Just. In a parallel universe Chris Grayling could have spent his birthday – yup, Failing Grayling’s birthday really is April Fools’ Day – to be the government’s frontman at the Downing Street daily coronavirus briefing. Just imagine Grayling’s excitement at awarding a ventilator contract to a company that has no prospect of ever making a ventilator. Still, that’s not much worse than the reality of the government having done sod all during January and February when it could have awarded contracts to companies that actually do make ventilators. Back in No 10, there must be an inquest going on into whose bright idea it was to have a daily coronavirus press conference. What must have seemed like a show of strength and leadership when Boris Johnson and Classic Dom came up with the plan a week or so ago, now merely exposes the government’s lack of preparations and complete cluelessness every 24 hours. What’s more, almost everyone in government knows it’s a disaster. Which is why most cabinet ministers switch their phones off for several hours every morning: because they don’t want to be the mug who winds up having to front the 45-minute embarrassment live on TV at 5pm. So today’s press conference was fronted by Alok Sharma, who not even everyone in the cabinet knows is the current business secretary. Though he is a huge improvement on both Dominic “Psycho” Raab and Michael Gove, simply because he doesn’t have any of their associated instability and lack of trust issues. Put simply, Sharma is a man in whom the public can have complete confidence. The downside is that the confidence they have is that he can be guaranteed to know next to nothing about anything. After stating the latest alarming death figures, Sharma lapsed into a whole range of generalities and platitudes. It’s come to something when even Donald Trump can see that the original “herd immunity” plan had been a disaster waiting to happen. Imagine being out-thought by the US Sun Bed God. Sharma then handed over to Yvonne Doyle, the director of Public Health England, who raced through her four slides at breakneck speed. Largely because they were all so thoroughly depressing. Believe it or not, that was actually the high point. The summit of gravitas and disinformation. Because from there on it was downhill all the way. Often these video press conferences can become atavistic with journalists asking a range of different questions that can easily be ignored. Either by merely answering the easiest question or one they wish had been asked. But now the lobby hunted as a pack, repeatedly pressing both Sharma and Doyle on the question of medical provision and testing. And Sharma and Doyle had nothing. Not even blanks to fire. Sharma kept trying to palm off the difficult questions on to Doyle, who then did her best to refer them back to the business secretary. The medical is now political and the political is medical and neither side wants to take the blame. To really regain the public’s trust, someone in government has to admit it basically did nothing for several months as it totally underestimated the crisis and was more interested in Boris’s sixth or seventh baby. But no one is prepared to do that so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. Why had Michael Gove insisted that thousands of ventilators were on their way next week when the actual figure is 30? Both Sharma and Doyle shrugged. Why were the Germans so far ahead of us on testing? Were we really so Little England that we thought we could learn nothing from Jerry? How come we only had tested 2,000 NHS staff out of about 1 million frontline workers? Again Sharma and Doyle just looked a little sheepish. Above their pay grades. “Have you got anything more than warm words and good intentions?” one reporter asked. Sharma nodded earnestly. His words were going to get a lot, lot warmer – red-hot, even – and his intentions were going to be the best ever. You ain’t seen nothing yet. B-b-baby. You ain’t seen nothing yet."
2020-04-01T17:14:48Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Johnson 'to review lockdown after Easter' as pressure grows over lack of testing - as it happened,"As Downing St confirmed at lunchtime that only 2,000 people out of 500,000 frontline NHS England workers had been tested for coronavirus, the government lifted its 15% cap on NHS staff testing. Effective today, chief executives of trusts have been instructed to make sure full capacity is used every day. At the daily news conference, Public Health Englandâ€™s Prof Yvonne Doyle also appeared to confirm that the UKâ€™s strategy will be to increase testing for the virus in the general population. It would be completely unacceptable if any banks were unfairly refusing funds to good businesses in financial difficulty, the business secretary, Alok Sharma, said. He said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will be saying more on helping businesses access the support they need in the coming days. Almost one million small firms could collapse within the next month (that is a fifth of small UK businesses) as they struggle to secure emergency cash meant to support them through the coronavirus lockdown, a report suggests. There were more cultural and sporting casualties of the pandemic as Edinburgh Festivals â€“ including the fringe â€“ and the Wimbledon tennis championships were all cancelled over public health concerns. For the latter, it is the first time it has been cancelled since WW2. The number of UK deaths in hospitals rose to 2,352 â€“ an increase of 563 (31%), by far the highest day-on-day rise so far. Police were told to use â€œjudgement and common senseâ€� in swiftly updated guidance, following reports of heavy handedness including the use of checkpoints and drones to enforce physical distancing. The lockdown could be driving down the number of people one person who has coronavirus infects, a study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggests. Prof John Edmunds, who led the research, said this should provide motivation to continue following government instructions on physical distancing: â€œWe must not take our foot off the pedalâ€�. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, became the fourth cabinet member to announce he had been self-isolating after developing coronavirus symptoms. Thatâ€™s all from us here on the UK side. If you would like to continue to follow the latest updates on the coronavirus pandemic, head over to the global live blog here."
2020-04-01T06:00:14Z,politics,Politics,What are Labour leadership candidates' green policies?,"These questions were put to the candidates before the coronavirus crisis 1. Is the climate crisis the biggest issue the UK faces as a nation and will you commit to making it Labour’s priority for the duration of this parliament? Rebecca Long-Bailey The climate crisis is the greatest challenge we face as a nation and as a globe, not just for this parliament but in the decades and century to come. The inactions of previous governments have escalated the urgency of the challenge we face; and it is a challenge we can only meet by addressing the crisis in our living standards and the crisis of faith in our democracy. As leader I will continue the work I’ve been doing with trade unions, Labour activists and technical experts to develop a plan on how we do this, for example, developing our policies such as insulating 27m homes, using public ownership to transition to a green, affordable energy system, creating an industrial strategy to deliver high-quality, unionised jobs across the country and developing a detailed, properly funded plan to make sure no one loses out from this transition. As a Labour party we need to work with communities about what policies they want to see that would transform their lives and meet the climate crisis. We need to continue to harness the energy and enthusiasm of campaigners and young climate strikers who have helped push the climate crisis to the top of the political agenda through their actions, and work with them to show the world we are opposed to Trump’s climate crisis denial when our country hosts Cop26 this year. Lisa Nandy Yes. As prime minister I would make reaching climate safety the top priority for the whole of my government. I know it is not beyond us not only to build a zero-carbon economy but also to lead the global effort required to reach climate safety. I know that solving the climate crisis means integrating the solutions into every part of what the government does and that means hard-wiring the answers into the very foundations of our country’s economic and foreign policies. One of the first things I did on becoming Labour’s shadow energy secretary back in 2015 was to read Elizabeth Kolbert’s book, Field Notes From A Catastrophe. It brought home to me the scale of the risks from the climate emergency. Climate breakdown isn’t just a far-off threat to other people in other places in some distant future. You can already see the impact that even the warming to date is having in terms of the horrific fires raging across Australia and California, the shifting rain patterns damaging livelihoods for millions of people across Asia and Africa, and the unprecedented flooding we’ve seen here in Britain in recent years. We don’t have the luxury of time so yes it would be a top priority for me during this parliament too.
Kier Starmer Yes – and for the next parliament when we are in government. We all have a common interest in rapid decarbonisation, so it needs to be a guiding thread across all policy areas: from foreign policy to local government, from transport to housing. 2. As Labour leader, how will you tackle the climate crisis between now and the next general election [ie what can be done while you are in opposition?]. Can you give three specific examples? RLB As leader I will continue my record of forcing the Tories to U-turn and back down on some of their most destructive policies, such as their support for fracking. It was Labour that meant parliament declared a climate and environmental emergency, work that I led. In parliament we need to keep piling the political pressure on the Tories, for example, using our presence there to bring an end to the ban on onshore wind in England and fighting any attempt to water down our environmental commitments in any trade deals we strike, particularly with the US. At the Cop26 later this year as Labour leader I will be stood shoulder to shoulder with campaigners and activists fighting for a landmark series of commitments and agreements. The eyes of the world will be on us when Trump, the climate breakdown denier, arrives and our prime minister gives him a warm welcome. Moves to curb the civil liberties of, or label peaceful activists as extremists, must be resisted. As Labour leader I also want to give prominence to what Labour can do in power. Many Labour local councils and mayors are declaring climate emergencies and developing their own Green New Deals with their local communities. The Labour councillors and community activists taking this lead are examples of how we can reach into local communities, organise and campaign – lessons we need to learn ahead of the next general election.
LN As shadow energy and climate secretary, before the Paris summit, I initiated a collaboration between more than 60 Labour councils across Britain to cut the UK’s carbon footprint by 10% through action in the places where Labour is in power. Before the next election there is the opportunity to build on this with more on-the-ground activism to deliver on the Paris agreement through everything from solar energy coops to community tree-planting schemes and investment in bus services. By showcasing the solutions in our communities, and seizing on the opportunity for good new jobs in every town, Labour can help build out the climate movement into the more broad-based, society-wide force that we need it to be. Only through a movement will we stop a reckless Trump trade deal, which would threaten decades of hard-won rights and protections, and pave our way back to No 10 Downing Street. KS The climate crisis cannot wait until 2024. So, I will work with Labour administrations wherever they are in power – from councils, city mayors to devolved governments – as they involve communities, trade unions and businesses, to design their own pathways to zero net carbon by 2030. We need to encourage bottom-up solutions through supporting climate assemblies and green cooperatives. We must also be an effective opposition in parliament, holding the government to account on the basis of the pace of decarbonisation our planet needs – not the unambitious targets they have set themselves. 3. Will Labour under your leadership commit to: • Retrofitting all UK homes [27m] and buildings by 2030 and fight to ensure all new buildings are zero carbon by the end of this parliament? • Producing 90% of the UK’s electricity from renewable sources [through 7,000 offshore, 2,000 onshore turbines and 3x expansion of solar] by 2030? • Producing 50% renewable heating through 8m heat pumps and investment in hydrogen? RLB Yes, I commissioned the expert report, Thirty by 2030 (pdf), these recommendations are based on. It gives us a real plan to not only hold the government to account on what they are failing to do – but also helps turn what can be abstract targets to most people into real, everyday changes for the better. Insulating homes will end fuel poverty. An active industrial strategy will make sure that Britain is the producer of the wind turbines and other technologies we need for the future, creating good jobs and apprenticeships in our towns, cities and regions. The opportunities for large-scale renewal are endless – we just need to be ambitious and creative. It is a central part of how I believe Labour can sell our aspirational socialism to people across the country. LN I know we need a wholesale transformation in the way we power and heat our homes and businesses but that this is possible and necessary and offers huge economic opportunities. As a windswept nation we can be the Saudi Arabia of clean energy, but all too often we are losing out on the jobs and factories to other countries with a different approach to industrial strategy and that has to change. KS I fully support Labour’s Green New Deal and the proposals for a Green Transformation Fund (pdf) and a National Investment Bank (pdf). The proposals offer a pathway to a greener economy married to social justice, which our country badly needs. It should be hardwired into everything we do as a country and as a party. 4. If yes, how should this work be financed and organised? RLB These are huge challenges and it requires bold and ambitious thinking. We already have deepening wealth inequality in this country and a crisis in living standards. The Conservative approach has been to load costs on to households that are already struggling, while letting energy companies profiteer. We can’t have this approach if we are going to turn this into an opportunity to deliver better lives and a better Britain. It’s why the proposal I set out at the 2019 election had public ownership and public investment in our energy system as a central plank, so we can be strategic and make sure that extra costs are not loaded on to homes that can’t afford it. For example, when it comes to insulating homes, it makes sense for the government to pay for the work upfront, and for the costs to be repaid by households who can afford it over time through savings on their energy bills. Lower-income households should not have to repay the cost of the works, so they can benefit from all the bill savings immediately. Delivering such a large programme in partnership with local communities, with local councils and public bodies playing a central role, can guarantee the quality of work to people’s homes and the quality of jobs we create. When it comes to developing the renewable energy sector and where the public is helping to provide the investment, the public should also get a long-term stake in what are profitable enterprises. The UK, as the world’s largest offshore wind market, should have a far greater role in manufacturing the technology, creating good, skilled jobs here, rather than relying on imports, as is currently the case. We should use our public stake to make sure these projects benefit communities, with local procurement boosting local supply chains. LN I would like to see a bigger role for people in every part of the country to influence and shape the transition so I’m fascinated to see what ideas will emerge from the first national citizens assembly on climate change. What’s clear is that the transition to date has not been funded fairly because low-income households have paid a disproportionately high contribution and the debate so far has been too technocratic and too driven from Brussels and Westminster. For the transition to work the solutions in the next phase must have broad support and benefit communities across the country and that’s more likely to happen if everyone can get involved. KS (see previous answer) 5. How will you ensure the poorest people in the UK and around the world are not made to pay disproportionately for the climate crisis? RLB For too long in this country, too many of our communities have been ignored and seen the erosion of their local public services. We cannot tackle the climate crisis by loading the costs on to the shoulders of those just making ends meet. As leader I will continue to pursue progressive mechanisms, such as public ownership and strategic public investment in the infrastructure we need for the future, in a way that delivers our broader goals of aspirational socialism. For example, expanding our bus networks and creating a public transport system that is integrated, accessible and affordable will improve our air quality and cut emissions, while improving regional connectivity, making life more convenient for millions. Internationally, we need to make sure the UK is a world leader not a world lagger – as the first in the world to industrialise and one of the wealthiest, we need to reduce our emissions at a rate that takes our fair share of the global responsibility to avoid more than 1.5 degrees of warming, as well as ensuring we are doing it in a way that is just and equitable at home. Social justice and aspiration go hand in hand with global justice. When Trump comes to this country for Cop26 Labour needs to join the voices from around the globe calling for urgent action. The poorest parts of the globe are already experiencing the worst impacts of climate breakdown, which they are least responsible for creating. That is why I support increasing the amount of international public climate finance the UK provides for mitigation and adaptation, and channelling these funds through the UN’s green climate fund, and away from the World Bank. Rather than welcome Trump to our country, we should be leading international efforts to establish a new fund to compensate countries in the global south for loss and damage suffered due to climate impacts. We can ensure the technologies developed in the UK and create jobs here through our green industrial revolution are also made available at reduced cost in the global south. LN It’s a tragedy and an injustice that it is the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world who are most exposed to the impacts of the climate crisis around the world. Their voice must be heard as we debate the solutions to the crisis, not just because it’s the right thing to do but also because it will help unlock the answers to a just transition. It was Europe’s approach of working together with the small island states of the South Pacific and the vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which built the global alliances that unlocked the Paris agreement. Britain’s leadership in international development helped to build these special relationships and shows why social justice and environmental justice go hand in hand. We should never see offsets as a cheap alternative to reducing pollution here at home and we must pay for the investments needed by ensuring the wealthiest who did most to cause the problem invest the most in fixing it, and by exploring the role that well-designed pollution taxes could play to ensure the fossil fuel industry helps clean up the mess it caused. KS The Green New Deal needs to be married to social justice both domestically and internationally. Domestically we need a just transition which provides good unionised green jobs, addresses regional inequalities and does not leave workers behind. The UK has profited from burning fossil fuels in the past, so we must assist developing countries in their leap forward, skipping our bad habits, building renewables rather than coal power stations. We should use our development budget – and work for greater international financial assistance – to help developing countries grow their own low-carbon economies. 6. Do you support more new nuclear power stations after Hinkley C is completed and, if so, how will they be funded? RLB I support new nuclear power where it is needed for the UK’s future energy security. We need to find the right funding model that will guarantee value for money for the taxpayer and ensure any public stake is used in a way that benefits local communities. Lisa Nandy I’m not writing my manifesto for the next general election just yet but I have argued consistently and for many years that now – right in the middle of a climate emergency – is not the time we should rule out a role for nuclear power or any other low-emission technology. The biggest challenges for the nuclear industry are the high costs associated with new nuclear stations, and their lack of a long-term sustainable solution to deal with the harmful waste they produce, but we will have to weigh these problems against the contribution nuclear power can make to meeting our energy demands in a way that creates good jobs and is consistent with building a zero-carbon economy and it is most important that we are guided by the science and the evidence on this. KS I support the Labour position that nuclear power is part of the mix of moving away from fossil fuels. But our overwhelming focus must be on increasing the energy share of renewables including solar, wind and tidal energy, and with decentralised energy. 7. Do you support HS2? RLB Yes. The government’s mismanagement of the cost and delivery date is a national scandal, and much more needs to be done to manage the local environmental impacts. However, HS2 is needed to increase the UK’s rail capacity, reducing reliance on our roads for passengers and freeing up capacity for more freight travel. This should be part of a more ambitious programme for public transport. For example, we should be building high-speed rail down from Scotland, projects like Crossrail for the north, connections between our towns and reopening branch closures. LN The government has completely mishandled the HS2 project. They have let costs spiral and failed to make the argument for the merits of the scheme. HS2 should never be allowed to justify any failure to invest in the bus networks and other clean public transport projects, which should be a higher priority than this single railway, but it should be possible to both improve the capacity of the existing rail and bus network and expand it too so yes, it should go ahead. KS If we are serious about the climate emergency, we must invest in green public transport. For that to work effectively there has to be a national plan for an integrated public transport network, and HS2 should have been a part of that. I voted against HS2 because of the social and environmental impact it will have on Euston in my constituency. But the project is now inevitably going ahead, and my focus is compensation and mitigation locally. I recognise the need for connectivity in the north and Midlands but the project should have started there, not from London. HS2 should not proceed at the expense of other really important rail upgrades like Crossrail for the north. 8. Do you support or oppose the third runway at Heathrow and/or all airport expansion? RLB Labour was clear in our manifesto that any expansion of airports must pass our tests on air quality, noise pollution, climate change obligations and countrywide benefits, including the current proposals for Heathrow expansion. We need to be rigorous in upholding these tests; as leading scientists have again pointed out the proposals do not meet Labour’s tests, particularly on climate change and as such I do not support them. LN I voted against a third runway at Heathrow because of the extraordinary environmental damage it would clearly cause, not just to our climate but to Londoners’ air quality too. I was a councillor in west London and the experiences I witnessed of people suffering from asthma was already shocking many years ago, and it absolutely can’t be allowed to get so much worse because of a failure of imagination in fixing our transport system. On airport expansion elsewhere in the country, we must be guided by the expert advice of the Committee on Climate Change in terms of what level of aviation growth could be consistent with our climate change laws and international commitments. KS I voted against Heathrow expansion because of the impact on climate change. We need to be serious about the climate emergency and our commitments under the Paris agreement. I personally don’t think that’s consistent with approving airport expansion but, of course, I’ll look at any proposals and measure them against climate tests. 9. Do you back financial support specifically for rewilding projects and commit to Labour’s existing policy to create 10 new national nature parks; rewild the 10 existing national parks and create “natural corridors” in the form of local parks, walking pathways, cycling lanes and canals? RLB Yes. These are examples of actions we need to take to tackle the climate crisis, but will also make our cities, towns and local communities nicer and healthier places to live, bringing public luxury to the spaces and services we care about. LN Tackling the climate emergency needs to go hand-in-hand with restoring our natural environment. Our country is one of the least wooded in the whole of Europe, and yet we know that trees lock up carbon, provide vital habitat for wildlife, and improve air quality in towns and cities. I also believe that every child deserves to have access to trees and green spaces as they grow up, wherever they live and whatever their parents’ income. So I would absolutely create 10 new national nature parks and back natural corridors. I would also enable more people to take control of the management of their local parks, and ensure that local government had the powers and funding to maintain them. Rewilding is something I think we need to explore with local communities in the places where schemes like this might go forward. I am convinced we can find the right mixture of natural regeneration, new tree-planting and support for sustainable farming in this country, but to do so we first need to see off the risks of a Trump trade deal that would sacrifice environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards and throw many UK farmers on the scrapheap. KS Rewilding is an essential part of the fightback against the climate and environmental emergency. I support ambitious tree-planting schemes and new nature parks to halt the devastating loss of biodiversity and to help in the fight against air pollution which plagues our streets. Our children are breathing toxic air in 71% of UK towns and cities - this is a national scandal and more green spaces must be part of the solution. 10. Do you support a post-Brexit agricultural subsidy regime to support environmental schemes such as tree planting, soil and peat restoration and flood protection? Should that funding be at least £1bn a year, ie a third of the current EU CAP scheme? RLB I support maintaining the current level of funding support to British farming and farmland management. However, I will pursue a “public money for public goods” approach, and would want to see agricultural subsidies conditioned on sustainable land use practices like tree planting, soil and peat restoration, flood protection and biodiversity promotion. Under my leadership, Labour would invest in forestation and landscape restoration, for example, our commitment to invest £3.7bn over a decade in tree planting, but this funding would be additional to payments in the agricultural subsidy regime. LN It’s bonkers that millionaires on the rich list are still raking in vast subsidies of taxpayers’ cash from farm subsidies. Investing public money should always be about securing public goods, not offering backdoor handouts to wealthy Tory donors. Our farmers will need to play a crucial role in restoring nature, storing carbon to cut emissions, and growing healthy and sustainable food, and these are public goods our subsidy regime should be helping us to meet. With Boris Johnson pursuing such a hard Brexit, there is a real risk that these goals could be undermined in the pursuit of a low-standards, reckless trade deal with Trump and we must fight that every step of the way. KS Trees, soil, and peat are natural carbon sinks so restoring and replanting them will be key to our aims of net zero carbon emissions. As the recent floods across much of England and Wales demonstrate, the UK’s flood protections are already insufficient, and the worsening climate crisis promises even more violent weather and rising sea levels. Significant investment in flood defences is therefore a priority to mitigate the worse effects of climate change. 11. Do you support the implementation of policies to reduce red meat consumption in the UK? If so what form might that take? RLB Growing numbers of people are cutting down on red meat, or becoming vegetarian and vegan, as people think about the environment and their health. It’s been really positive how we’ve seen businesses respond to that growing demand in producing substitutes for old favourites like the sausage roll. Too often the green movement has been painted as telling people what they can and can’t do. We need to find a different way of having discussions as a country on these issues while not losing focus on the most urgent questions facing us. Fighting climate change is about key players across the world coming together to collectively address the challenge we face, and working out in this country how we can restructure our economy so that it is both sustainable and able to support a high quality of life for everyone. LN The priority for governments must be to focus on the biggest driver of emissions, which is the global fossil fuel industry; but the Committee on Climate Change has made it clear that we also need to think about how we manage our land and produce our food. In my view this is not about telling people what to eat – it’s about tackling food waste, working with farmers to reduce pollution from things like artificial fertilisers and pesticides, and protecting high-quality food production in the UK from the impacts of reckless trade deals. I also think we have to have a much stronger focus on food poverty. Children going to school hungry in one of the richest countries in the world is both heart-breaking and shameful. KS After fossil fuels, the food industry – particularly the meat and dairy sector – is one of the most significant contributors to climate change and, in many countries, to deforestation. All of us should therefore think about how we might reduce our consumption of red meat. But changes in behaviour, important as they are, should not distract us from the systemic nature of the problem of climate change. That’s why I support Labour’s plans for a radical Green New Deal to combat the climate and environmental emergency. 12. Do you support a frequent flyer tax to reduce air travel? RLB At the moment the vast majority of the population fly once a year or less – they shouldn’t be unfairly taxed. We don’t want to penalise or make it harder for people to go on holiday. But it is right to consider how we ask wealthy frequent flyers to shoulder more responsibility, or reduce the frequency of their flights. In government as Labour leader I would ensure we review aviation taxation and consider and consult on the development and implementation of proposals recommended by the Committee on Climate Change. LN It cannot be right that when 70% of flights are taken by just 15% of the public, the wealthiest people who are polluting the most do not pay a level of tax to reflect this and instead pay the same as the family taking their hard-earned rest once a year, so yes as prime minister I would look to make the system fairer and greener. KS Air travel is a particularly fossil fuel-intensive form of travel so, especially while we do not have the technology for green flights, we should encourage people to use alternative forms of transport where possible. We need to make sure that our tax system encourages that. 13. Will you commit to greater funding for public transport, cycling and walking than for road building? RLB Yes. We need greater funding for and an expansion of public transport, cycling and walking for all sorts of reasons – not just in tackling the climate crisis, but to improve our economy, the connections between cities and towns, and rural areas, making our public transport more accessible and to encourage healthier lives and cleaner air. LN It is absolutely scandalous that when 60% of journeys are by bus, literally thousands of local bus routes have been cut since the Tories came back to power, hundreds just in the last year, and fares have been allowed to rocket too. I would invest properly in public transport – and yes nationalise the railways, but also give councils the power to run bus routes for people not profit so they can set the fares and the routes and ensure all the buses in the fleet are zero carbon by 2025. I know that where Labour is in power, our mayors and councils are paving the way on cycling and as a result the number of cyclists is going up, so I would work with them to ensure communities get the investment they need to build on these successes. KS The government has made a political choice to spend transport budgets on roads rather than greener and cheaper forms of transport. I would lead a Labour government with different priorities: building a more sustainable, affordable, accessible and integrated transport system – with investment in bus services, renationalisation of our railways, and support for cycling and pedestrians. 14. Do you back clean air zones that charge or ban polluting vehicles in urban areas, which government research shows are the most effective policy to reduce air pollution? RLB Yes, I support a new Clean Air Act enshrining the World Health Organization’s advisory air quality standards into domestic law. This would include clean air zones around schools. I was proud to announce Labour’s electric car revolution at Labour conference last year, setting out how an industrial strategy can support the sector to transition to manufacturing electric vehicles and batteries, and proposing creative measures such as electric community car clubs. So alongside an expansion in public transport we are also ensuring that we are transitioning over to zero emission vehicles, and that transition supports jobs and industries here in Britain. LN It is truly shocking that one in 19 deaths in our largest cities and towns are linked to air pollution when we can and should do much more to prevent this. In London, Oxford, Reading and most of the south-east, levels are above the limits recognised as safe by the World Health Organization and on some days many kids can’t even play outside in their school playgrounds without a high risk of suffering an asthma attack caused by the toxic state of the air. Labour in local government is leading the way on tackling this through schemes like [London mayor Sadiq Khan’s] Ulez [ultra-low emission zone] and [Bristol mayor Marvin Rees’s] diesel ban in Bristol. We need the new clean air legislation expected this year to ensure our air is healthy to breathe, in line with WHO advice, and to bolster the strong local government action Labour is leading. KS Air pollution already contributes to over 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK, and is particularly damaging to the health of our children, who are breathing unsafe levels of air pollution in 71% of our towns and cities. That’s why I’ve called for an immediate Clean Air Act to tackle air pollution by creating clean air zones. 15. The Committee on Climate Change says the UK is unprepared for the impacts of climate change. Will you increase funding for adaptation and what policies do you support to prepare for the inevitable increases in flooding, heatwaves and summer water shortages? RLB Yes. I stand by Labour’s 2019 commitment to invest an additional £5.6bn to level up flood defences over 10 years, paid for through public capital investment. The new fund will prioritise areas of need, particularly in regions such as the north-west, Yorkshire and the east Midlands that have been neglected under the Tories. Climate change will place huge pressures on our freshwater resources. But the UK’s privatised water companies have done a terrible job managing that resource, with only 14% of rivers safe for swimming, record fines issued for sewage leaks, and 20-25% of our water wasted before it even reaches our taps. That is why managing our water security in a warming climate will require publicly owned, democratically accountable water companies. Better insulated homes, delivered through Labour’s mass retrofitting programme, will be better adapted to extreme summer heat as well as keeping us warm in winter. LN Short-term Tory cuts to flood budgets left scars on communities across the country and are one of the worst impacts of their damaging austerity programme. We’re lucky to have some of the foremost experts in the entire world in the Met Office, the Committee on Climate Change, and in many of our universities, to advise us on what we should do to prepare for climate change and so we should heed their advice about what dangerous impacts we must prepare for to ensure we are limiting the damage from worsening extreme weather wherever we can and that means properly investing in flood defences. KS As demonstrated by the recent flooding of much of England and Wales and the fact that the last five years have been the hottest five years on record, the effects of climate breakdown have already begun. Mitigating those effects will be essential and funding needs to match our new needs – but it should not distract from our absolute commitment to prevention through urgent emission reductions and a Green New Deal. 16. What direct diplomacy should Labour undertake with international partners to help make Cop26 a success? RLB The eyes of the world will be on us at Cop26; we need to show them we reject those who deny the climate crisis or continue to fail to act on its urgency. World leaders have to heed the warnings of young climate activists whose future is at stake; the world is increasingly in flames as we have seen in the Amazon, California, Australia and in Scotland last spring. As Labour leader I will work directly with our sister parties in Europe and across the world, both in power and in opposition, to help make sure an ambitious set of demands and commitments are agreed at Cop26. LN I was proud to lead Labour’s international delegation to the historic Paris summit and to meet the civil society leaders and diplomats who worked so tirelessly to secure that deal. So I know how precious and hard-won it was and is and why it is essential we now defend it and see it implemented in full. Across the world it is gutsy, young women like the prime ministers of Finland and New Zealand, who are carrying the hopes and dreams of Greta and the youth movement into the global diplomatic arena and making strides forward and if I am prime minister I promise to join them. Ahead of the Cop26 summit in Scotland later this year, there is an opportunity for Labour to build on the initiative I kick-started five years ago to showcase climate solutions where we are in power in local government, city halls and the Welsh assembly and to share the learning from these experiences internationally, as I know Sadiq has been doing with London’s experiences through the C40 network of cities who helped secure the Paris agreement. KS We know that climate change is an unavoidably international problem. So we must match our efforts for a Green New Deal at home with our efforts abroad. The UK should use our Cop26 presidency to build and lead an international net-zero coalition. On 8 March 2020, I’m meeting with activists and experts in Birmingham to begin co-designing the demands that we think the Labour party should make of our government and of governments around the world at Cop26. We will be there in Glasgow alongside our European sister parties to hold governments to account for future generations. 17. Would you support a progressive alliance with the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Greens and Plaid Cymru around climate action and backing for a green new deal? RLB Labour’s green industrial revolution is one of the most ambitious policy platforms in the world for how a country can decarbonise and be sustainable. It can be a rallying call for the concrete demands we need to implement to meet our climate targets, and put the achievement of social justice and the creation of good, unionised jobs at its heart. I will work with anyone who supports those demands in parliament, across our trade unions, the labour movement, civil society and activists. As Labour leader I will make sure that Labour is part of the coalition keeping this issue high on the political agenda and will resist any moves to restrict the civil liberties of peaceful activists and campaigners ahead of Cop26. At Cop26 I think Labour should push for the UK to adopt more ambitious national targets on climate change, to provide increased levels of public climate finance, and to lead international efforts to establish a new fund for loss and damage. LN I have seen the leadership [Green party MP] Caroline Lucas has brought to the climate debate, and I know that like me she has championed a Green New Deal so yes of course I would work with her and MPs from all parties to make it a reality. KS We need a Labour government to implement a Green New Deal, hardwired into all our policies to mitigate the damage of climate and environmental breakdown, while empowering communities and creating good, green jobs across the country. Every community deserves the right to vote for a Labour government. But we will work with other parties in parliament where they share our aims."
2020-03-31T19:12:27Z,politics,Politics,A Govester briefing is proof we're scraping the trustworthiness barrel | John Crace,"That sound you just heard? The barrel being scraped. When the main purpose of the Downing Street press conference is to convey the truly horrific death tolls from the coronavirus and to put the best gloss on the government’s – at best – belated response, the least you might hope for is a cabinet minister of some gravitas and sincerity. But with Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock both sidelined with the virus and Rishi Sunak – just about the only person who inspires confidence despite being only 12 – unwilling to make it a daily gig, the government is having to scrabble around for whoever they can get. And with some ministers – such as Priti Patel, Liz Truss, Grant Shapps and Jacob Rees-Mogg – being obvious non-starters both on the intellect and empathy counts, the gene pool of talent is remarkably thin. And after Dominic Raab’s less than convincing, finger-licking performance the day before, he’s unlikely to get a call back any time soon. So this time we got Michael Gove as front of house. A man who has almost become a dictionary definition of someone who cannot be trusted. A politician who was twice rejected as leader by the Tory MPs who knew him best on the grounds he could not be relied on not to stab himself in the back. On the plus side, he had remembered to replace the pyjama bottoms that he had worn for the Zoom cabinet meeting in the morning with his suit trousers – though everyone in the entire cabinet now has it in for Liz T after she upstaged them all by posing in front of a Union Jack. On the downside, he began by insisting on mentioning “the Facts”. The Facts and the Govester are uneasy bedfellows. And after listing the recent mortality rates, Mikey swiftly went off piste. Rather than getting to grips with any details of the levels of testing, he went headlong into obfuscation and wish fulfilment. Yes, we were doing a few more tests than the day before – about 17 – and we needed to do a lot more. The problem was getting the necessary reagents to make them. The Govester rather skirted over the reason we were short of reagents was that his government was totally asleep on the job back in January and February – the scandal of the Big Ben bongs and the necessity of the 10-day half-term break for Boris were far more important – at a time when the chemicals were more widely available. Now every country that makes them is predictably keen to hang on to them for themselves. But the Govester did have better news on ventilators as we would now be buying some from EU countries. He said that through gritted teeth. Stephen Powis, the national medical director of the NHS, looked equally uneasy when called on to make his presentation. Though mainly because he had clearly been designated to find a few graphs that showed the crisis in a more positive light, when he clearly believes the shit has yet to really hit the fan. So he started off with a slide showing that fewer people were using public transport. That was his best lead off shot. He then moved on to another slide which apparently showed the UK mortality rate stabilising. Even though the curve appeared alarmingly steep. Powis also – clearly under instructions – chose to ignore why the German and South Korean death figures were so much lower. Eventually, though, his integrity won through. “These are just green shoots,” he repeated several times. And winter could return at any time to snuff them out. The partial lockdown was essential and here to stay for a while. And the alt-right libertarian half-wits who were demanding the right to do what they wanted would just have to suck it up. It wasn’t that Powis objected to them killing themselves. It was them taking out the rest of us at the same time with which he had problems. Inevitably most of the questions focused on the UK’s inadequate testing systems – both for NHS workers and the general public – and the capacity for hospitals to cope with more patients. Here Gove showed himself to be something of a new man. Normally, Mikey reckons that experts have nothing more of value to say than anything that happens to pop into his head. But under a sustained grilling from journalists, he now chose to answer as few questions as possible. “I think that’s one for either Stephen or Jenny,” he said. Trying to make it look like courtesy rather than cowardice. Both Powis and the deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, did their best to level with the country. Things were critical but so far the NHS was building capacity and was coping under the strain. Harries did sound a little optimistic about the possibility of home, postal tests – in my neck of the woods we haven’t had a mail delivery for more than a week – but that was her only slight mis-step. We were where we were and she and Powis would be back tomorrow or the next day to provide further updates. Just who the government would find to front – leadership is asking way too much these days – the roadshow was anyone’s guess."
2020-03-31T18:29:41Z,politics,Politics,MPs call for 'virtual Commons' amid Covid-19 early recess,"MPs from across the political spectrum are calling for a virtual House of Commons to be established to scrutinise the government’s response to coronavirus. Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the UK should also look to New Zealand and create a select committee to question the government’s Covid-19 strategy. He wants a weekly PMQs with Boris Johnson through video-conferencing and an end to the rule that stops MPs from tabling written questions during recess so that the public can get more information from government. Parliament broke for recess a week early as the number of cases of the virus around Westminster increased. MPs are not due back in the Commons until 21 April. One hundred MPs from Labour, the SNP and the Green party have written a letter to the clerk of the House of Commons, John Benger, asking for his support in setting up a form of digital parliament. Davey said: “If it wasn’t a dangerous infectious virus but a major emergency, parliament would have been recalled. We wouldn’t have gone on recess. “We think scrutiny is good for government policy. We’ve shown opposition parties are prepared to behave responsibly. I think we can find a way to get things cracking and get an online virtual parliament to serve the nation.” He said a specialist select committee focusing on Covid-19 could mirror the one set up in New Zealand in March, named the epidemic response committee, which is chaired by the leader of the opposition. The letter to the Commons’ clerk was initiated by Labour’s shadow minister for innovation, Chi Onwurah, who said: “People up and down the country have made huge behavioural changes in a matter of days and we must show we are capable of it too.” Darren Hughes, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said: “Ministers and public officials must be held to account by those with a full suite of powers to call evidence, witnesses and use the full clout of parliament. “Cabinet is showing that politics can continue to function during this crisis. Parliament must show the same, with the Speaker leading the way in providing accountability at this urgent hour.”"
2020-03-31T18:13:20Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus live: NHS to get thousands of new ventilators 'next week', as death toll rises to 1,789 - as it happened","A total of 1,789 patients have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK, as of 5pm on Monday. This represents a 27% day-on-day increase â€“ by far the biggest so far. Covid-19 was mentioned on 210 death certificates in England and Wales by 20 March, according to new stats released this morning by the ONS. This was the first time non-hospital deaths (in the community and in care homes) were included in the death figures. Thousands of new ventilators are to be delivered to the NHS next week, Michael Gove told the daily news conference. He said that as well as buying more from abroad, the UK was developing new sources of supply at home, which would roll off the production line this weekend to NHS hospitals. There are some signs that physical distancing measures are working to flatten the spread of infection, but this is no time to become complacent, said Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England. He said while there was a â€œbit of a plateauâ€� in the number of new cases testing positive, â€œwe must not take our foot off the pedalâ€�. Gove added that â€œthis is absolutely not the timeâ€� to be relaxing physical distancing measures: â€œPeopleâ€™s sacrifices are worth it, they are making a difference, but we must not let up.â€� Nearly 3,000 migrant doctors, nurses and paramedics plus their family members are to have their visas extended for a year to assist the fight against coronavirus, the Home Office announced. The extension, which is free of charge, will apply to about 2,800 NHS workers whose visas are due to expire before 1 October. You can follow our global liveblog here. Thatâ€™s all for from the UK for today."
2020-03-30T20:02:22Z,politics,Politics,"Extend Brexit transition by years over coronavirus, UK told","The largest group in the European parliament has urged the UK government to do the “responsible thing” and extend the Brexit transition period, as coronavirus plays havoc with the timetable for an EU-UK deal. The centre-right European People’s party (EPP), which unites the parties of 11 EU leaders, including Angela Merkel and Leo Varadkar, issued a statement on Monday calling on the government to extend the Brexit transition beyond the end of the year. Christophe Hansen, a MEP from Luxembourg who sits on the European parliament’s international trade committee, said: “Under these extraordinary circumstances, I cannot see how the UK government would choose to expose itself to the double whammy of the coronavirus and the exit from the EU single market, which will inevitably add to the disruption, deal or no deal. “I can only hope that common sense and substance will prevail over ideology. An extension of the transition period is the only responsible thing to do.” David McAllister, the German MEP who leads the European parliament’s work on the future relationship with the UK, said the pandemic complicated an “already very ambitious” schedule. “The ball is now clearly in the British court,” he added.
Under the withdrawal agreement, the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December 2020, terminating British membership of the EU single market and customs union. But it can be extended for one or two years if both sides agree by 1 July. The EU has made little secret it would back any extension request, but the British government continues to rule that out. Responding to the EPP statement, a UK government spokesperson said: “The transition period ends on 31 December 2020, as enshrined in UK law, which the prime minister has made clear he has no intention of changing.” The plea for extra time comes as British and EU politicians prepared to hold their first meeting to discuss putting in place the Irish Sea border. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, was due to hold a conference call with the European commission’s vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, on Monday to discuss how to implement the agreement on the Irish border. The pair were also due to discuss citizens’ rights, amid concern from campaigners that the coronavirus crisis would make it harder for European Union nationals in the UK to secure their status. Following the meeting, the two sides issued separate statements and each described talks as “constructive”. However, the EU struck a more insistent tone, saying there was an “urgent need” for a timetable on putting into place customs procedures and animal health checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. EU officials have been alarmed by repeated statements from the prime minister that there will not be controls on goods crossing this internal UK border – a statement that contradicts what he agreed in the withdrawal agreement. The British government stated it was committed “to upholding our obligations under the Northern Ireland protocol”. The latest talks were not intended to touch on the future relationship, amid rising doubts about the prospects for agreeing an unprecedented deal spanning trade, security and fishing rights by the end of the year. British and EU negotiators had concluded only three and a half days of formal talks before the coronavirus struck Europe heavily. A second round due to be held in London earlier this month was scrapped, while next week’s talks seem unlikely to go ahead, despite previous hopes of running them by video conference. British officials say they continue to explore video-conferencing. But it’s not a simple fix. At least 10 to 20 people can take part in just one thematic topic for each side, making virtual talks complicated to organise when individuals are working from home. Talks may cover about 10 different themes. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has the virus, while his UK opposite number, David Frost, has symptoms and has gone into self-isolation. Officials on both sides say they are in regular contact."
2020-03-30T19:42:54Z,politics,Politics,Ex-officials with experience of crises recalled to Whitehall,"Former civil servants with emergency planning experience have been asked to return to Whitehall to help the government response to coronavirus as Dominic Cummings developed symptoms, Downing Street confirmed on Monday. Boris Johnson’s key adviser, who was last spotted as he jogged through Downing Street on Friday, suffered mild symptoms over the weekend, Whitehall sources said. The prime minister, the health secretary and the chief medical officer are already self-isolating after developing symptoms towards the end of last week. Cummings, 48, a father of one, is believed to be recovering in his family home in north London with his wife, Mary Wakefield, an editor at the Spectator. A self-styled political disruptor who helped lead Britain’s pro-Brexit referendum campaign in 2016, he has been blamed for briefing journalists that the UK was seeking herd immunity against the coronavirus. The government and its scientific advisers deny that was ever their strategy. Last week, Downing Street rejected as “a highly defamatory fabrication” a claim that Cummings initially argued against strict measures to contain coronavirus in a view summarised as “if that means some pensioners die, too bad”. The former special adviser to Michael Gove and Vote Leave campaign director will now have to spend at least a week in quarantine, according to Public Health England guidelines. His absence from the centre of government comes as former senior civil servants with emergency planning experience were drafted in to No 10 to help with the government’s response.
Downing Street said that ex-senior civil servants have been asked to return to Whitehall as the government seeks to coordinate its response to the virus. “In No 10 and across government we have put in place contingency plans to ensure we can carry on working throughout this outbreak and to ensure we have all the capacity we need to lead the nationwide response,” Johnson’s spokesman said. A Whitehall source said there has been a “long-term problem” with staff retention in the senior civil service. “Staff shortages and absences through illness have led to a lack of experienced hands,” the source said. In a further development, the government announced that an experienced mandarin, Alex Chisholm, has been appointed second-in-command of the British civil service and given the task of overseeing Johnson’s reforms. Civil service reform has been a key objective of Cummings, who believes Whitehall is responsible for many policy failures. In a blog post earlier this year, Cummings called for “weirdos and misfits” to join the civil service but his approach backfired when one new contractor, Andrew Sabisky, soon quit after controversial previous comments over eugenics were unearthed. Chisholm, 52, will succeed John Manzoni, who was chief executive of the civil service and permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office, and will take the title of chief operating officer. Johnson tested positive on Friday for coronavirus and is self-isolating in Downing Street. He said he had experienced mild symptoms over the previous 24 hours, including a temperature and cough, but continues to lead the government. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said he had also tested positive, while England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has shown symptoms. The government has faced criticism from public health experts for failing to heed its own advice to the public on how to contain the coronavirus through physical distancing. The Scotland secretary, Alister Jack, who sat between Johnson and Hancock at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, confirmed at the weekend that he had a cough and a temperature – common symptoms of coronavirus – and would remain at home, making him the third cabinet minister to go into self isolation. Parliament has now closed for four weeks as the start of the planned Easter recess was brought forward because of concerns about the spread of the virus. MPs and peers will not return until 21 April at the earliest and even then it night not be business as usual. The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, said that “virtual parliament and virtual select committees” could be a possibility as he announced the extended recess on Wednesday evening."
2020-03-30T19:20:33Z,politics,Politics,"With Raab at the reins, things are really getting finger-lickin' bad | John Crace","Cast your mind back to the Tory leadership contest last June. Back then, Dominic Raab was voted out even before the last five Undateables of Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Rory Stewart got to appear in a live televised debate. This means Conservative MPs considered Raab to be a worse option than both someone as pathologically untrustworthy as the Govester, and a man, in Stewart, who would soon not even be a member of the party. Now take a deep breath, preferably not within two metres of a stranger: with Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock temporarily out of action, Raab has been the de facto leader of the country for the last five days. Or at least the politician tasked with doing all the front-of-house prime ministerial stuff. Not that we would have necessarily known, as no one can recall having seen the foreign secretary in person for more than a week. Rumour has it he had yet more unfinished body-disposal business to take care of first. Having a stand-in prime minister that looks like the serial killer in every Netflix miniseries is not altogether reassuring. Yet we are where we are, and shortly after 5pm, Raab, flanked by the UK’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, and the medical director for Public Health England, Yvonne Doyle, took centre stage for the daily Downing Street press conference. Complete with a new logo, on lecterns that looked like they had been knocked up out of police crime-scene tape. Presumably, Dom has picked up plenty of rolls on his travels. He did not get off to the best of starts. Just as Raab was going through the daily checklists of things not to do to spread the coronavirus, he repeatedly licked his fingers. The bloke who was doing the sign-language service for the BBC looked as if he was about to have a meltdown. Raab’s main message, delivered in a deliberate – if slightly sweaty – monotone, was about the help he was planning to provide for Brits stranded abroad. While promising to do his best to repatriate everyone who was unable to get flights home, he managed to imply that most of those stuck in South America, Morocco and Cyprus had been dawdling on the beach to get the best of the winter sun and had failed to follow the spread of the pandemic on the news. It didn’t quite square with reports of frantic tourists stuck abroad who had found their flights had been cancelled. But better late than never, I suppose. Neither were Vallance’s efforts to talk us through the science and the effects of the lockdown altogether successful – though the fault lay entirely with the IT team, rather than the chief scientific adviser. “Can we have the next slide please?” he snapped, somewhat impatiently. Which was the first that any of us knew he had actually been referring to previous slides up to this point, as none had appeared on screen. After that, we were rather playing catch-up. We were doing better than Italy and Spain, he observed, trying to be upbeat – something that clearly doesn’t come naturally to him – and were about on a par with France. He didn’t explain why Germany and South Korea were so far ahead of us in reducing their mortality rates. The questions from the media tried to pin things down a little, but Raab hasn’t spent years evading police custody without becoming a past master of the evasive answer. He couldn’t say if we were doing the right or wrong number of tests, and failed to explain why the UK had initially adopted a policy of coronavirus “no big deal” appeasement, which was why we were now right at the back of the queue for many of the medical supplies we needed. Raab was quick to support the police, however, in their attempts to enforce the partial lockdown. After all, if they were busy stopping people from buying Easter eggs, then they wouldn’t be out and about investigating more serious crimes. He remained ambivalent about the idea that Brexiter death-cult libertarians should be allowed to do what they want, providing they wore a badge saying: “In the event of me or one of my relatives contracting the virus, we wish to refuse all hospital treatment.”
The foreign secretary did, though, hint at a possible reckoning with China once the pandemic was over. Quite what shape that might take was left unsaid, though the Brexit party chairman, Richard Tice, was well ahead of him on this. He had made it clear he would decline any second-rate Chinese medical equipment, and would only accept ventilators that were British-made. Why else had we left the EU? Now was the time to take back control. Of our own deaths. Halfway through a sentence, Raab abruptly ended the press conference and headed for the exit. Perhaps no foreign secretary was better than a bad foreign secretary. There were so many surfaces to touch, fingers to lick. And he didn’t know when his next chance might come."
2020-03-30T18:01:51Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus live: Dominic Raab announces £75m plan to fly stranded Britons home – as it happened,"Evening summary The government has announced a Â£75m initiative to fly Britons who are stranded abroad home. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said charter flights would help repatriate Britons from â€œpriority countriesâ€�, and travellers in countries where commercial flights were running would be given subsidies for tickets. The UKâ€™s death toll from Covid-19 has risen to 1,408. The figures published by the Department of Health and Social Care relate to those that had died in hospitals as of 5pm on Sunday. From tomorrow, the ONS will begin producing weekly statistics which take in deaths in the community. The number of coronavirus-related admissions to hospitals is expected to continue to rise in coming weeks. Currently the NHS is seeing around 1,000 new patients a day, but the governmentâ€™s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, insisted this was â€œnot an accelerationâ€�. He added that though the number â€œmay go up a little bitâ€�, it could begin to stabilise and fall in two or three weeks time. London may be â€œtwo or four weeks awayâ€� from its peak of coronavirus cases, according to the cityâ€™s mayor. Sadiq Khan said his estimate was â€œnot an exact scienceâ€� but referred to when the largest number of people would have the virus, and when the highest number of deaths would be recorded. BrightHouse and Carluccioâ€™s have entered administration. The two UK companies said they had suffered a slump in customers since non-essential shops were shut as part of the lockdown. More than 4,000 jobs are at risk. The Prince of Wales has come out of self-isolation. Clarence House confirmed that Charles, 71, had consulted with his doctor after testing positive for coronavirus last week. Dominic Cummings, the prime ministerâ€™s chief adviser, is self-isolating with symptoms in line with those of the virus. The news comes after Boris Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, were confirmed as positive cases last week."
2020-03-30T10:05:27Z,politics,Politics,Dominic Cummings self-isolates after experiencing coronavirus symptoms,"Dominic Cummings has developed symptoms of coronavirus over the weekend and is self-isolating, a source has confirmed. Boris Johnson’s key adviser, who was last seen running through Downing Street on Friday, is believed to have experienced mild symptoms including a cough. The prime minister and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, are already self-isolating after developing symptoms towards the end of last week.
A Whitehall source confirmed a report by the Daily Mail’s Jason Groves that Cummings was still communicating with No 10. Last week, Downing Street rejected as “a highly defamatory fabrication” a claim that Cummings initially argued against strict measures to contain coronavirus in a view summarised as “if that means some pensioners die, too bad”. The claim, initially made in the Sunday Times, said that at one private event at the end of February, Cummings outlined the government’s strategy at the time in a way that was summarised by some present as “herd immunity, protect the economy, and if that means some pensioners die, too bad.” A Downing Street spokesman said last week: “This is a highly defamatory fabrication which was not put to No 10 by the Sunday Times before publication. The article also includes a series of apparent quotes from meetings which are invented.” Johnson tested positive on Friday for coronavirus and is self-isolating in Downing Street. He said he had experienced mild symptoms over the previous 24 hours, including a temperature and cough, but continues to lead the government. Hancock said he had also tested positive, while England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has shown symptoms. Cummings, 48, who is a father of one, is believed to be recovering in his family home in north London with his wife, Mary Wakefield, an editor at the Spectator. A controversial figure and a self-styled political disruptor who helped lead Britain’s pro-Brexit referendum campaign in 2016, he has been blamed for briefing journalists that the UK was seeking herd immunity against the coronavirus. The government and its scientific advisers deny that was ever their strategy. The government has faced criticism from public health experts for failing to heed their own advice to the public on how to contain the coronavirus through social distancing. The Scotland secretary, Alister Jack, who sat between Johnson and Hancock at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, confirmed at the weekend that he had a cough and a temperature – common symptoms of coronavirus – and would remain at home, making him the third cabinet minister to shut themselves away. Parliament has now closed for four weeks as the start of the planned Easter recess was brought forward over concerns about the spread of the virus. MPs and peers will not return until 21 April at the earliest and even then it night not be business as usual. The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, said that “virtual parliament and virtual select committees” could be a possibility as he announced the extended recess on Wednesday evening."
2020-03-29T17:53:39Z,politics,Politics,Threat from far right may be receding since Tory election victory,"The threat from the rise of far-right terrorism in Britain could be diminishing after Boris Johnson’s election victory because supporters of the ideology feel they are being listened to, according to a former head of MI5. Lord Evans of Weardale said “alienated” voters normally vulnerable to exploitation by far-right groups such as the British National party (BNP), English Defence League (EDL) and National Action might feel that their voices had been heard at the ballot box with the significant win for the Conservatives in December’s election. The former MI5 director general, who led Britain’s domestic security service between 2006 and 2013, said: “Whatever you think of the outcome of the recent election in the UK, the fact that some of the legitimate concerns that were being used as a pretext by English nationalists have now been formally acknowledged at the ballot box might be a good outcome, even though it is sort of disconcerting for southern liberals. “There was a significant alienated and disenfranchised group out there who didn’t think the system was taking any notice of them. And that’s where you need to be concerned about extremists exploiting legitimate concerns. “Disaffected English nationalists were manifesting themselves at the extremes in things like the British National party and National Action, which fed the undertone that articulated itself as extreme rightwing terrorism.” However, the crossbench peer warned that it remained to be seen whether potential far-right supporters would be wholly satisfied by Johnson’s administration. “Attention still needs to be paid to this group, as it is not clear that they will feel entirely assuaged as a result of the fact that people are paying wider attention to them now. Terrorist problems emerge when you have a significant population who feel alienated and nobody takes notice of them, causing frustration and anger,” he added. Evans, who was made a life peer in 2014, made the comments in an interview with the US-based Combat Terrorism Center. He has previously said the rise of far-right terrorism in Britain has been encouraged by years of austerity following the 2008 recession. “I suspect it is a reflection of the social pressures on communities as a result of austerity measures. There seems to be a constituency of disaffected males (for the most part, but not entirely) who find extreme rightwing beliefs attractive. And they have started to get their acts together to organise into groups and plot.” In the interview, he said some far-right terrorists had been “consciously and deliberately inspired by the perceived success of violent Islamists”. He added that the EDL was “mutually symbiotic” with Anjem Choudary’s al-Muhajiroun group and described the emergence of neo-Nazi terrorist organisation National Action and its successor groups, which have described their ideology as “white jihad”, as predictable. He added: “There is some evidence that they have been consciously and deliberately inspired by the perceived success of the violent Islamists in getting their grievances on the table as a result of violence and thought, ‘Well, we can do something like that.’” Last September the head of counterterror police, Neil Basu, vowed to thwart the rise of the far right, which the force has said is the fastest-growing terrorist threat in the UK. The number of white terror suspects being arrested in the UK has outstripped those of Asian background for two years in a row, and of the 25 attack plots that have been foiled since March 2017, 16 were Islamist, eight far right and one “other”. In 2018 MI5 took the lead in investigating the most dangerous extreme rightwing terrorists in a sign of how seriously the threat was being taken. Some terrorists were incited by extreme rightwing propaganda, such as Thomas Mair, who murdered the MP Jo Cox in 2016. But others, like Darren Osborne, who attacked Muslim worshippers with a van in north London, had acted after reading lawful material from groups such as the EDL and mainstream media."
2020-03-29T17:25:36Z,politics,Politics,"Stephen Kinnock targeted by police for visiting father, Neil","The MP son of Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, has been publicly shamed by police for â€œnon-essentialâ€� travel during the coronavirus lockdown after going to celebrate his fatherâ€™s 78th birthday. Stephen Kinnock, the MP for Aberavon in South Wales, posted a picture of himself sitting on a chair outside his parentsâ€™ London home, adhering to guidelines to stay two metres apart, as they marked the occasion with his wife, the former prime minister of Denmark, Helle Thorning-Schmidt.
But officers from South Wales police, 150 miles away, rounded on him for the decision to go to see his family. It was the latest example of lockdown enforcement tactics deployed by police across the country, who have broken up parties, deterred motorists and walkers with drones and dyed a lake black to put off swimmers under strict physical distancing rules. In the tweet, with his parents sitting on their doorstep in the background, Stephen Kinnock wrote:
South Wales police replied with: â€œHello @SKinnock we know celebrating your Dadâ€™s birthday is a lovely thing to do, however this is not essential travel. We all have our part to play in this, we urge you to comply with @GOVUK restrictions, they are in place to keep us all safe. Thank you.â€�
The MP then defended the move, saying he had been delivering â€œnecessary suppliesâ€� and only stayed â€œlong enough to sing â€˜happy birthdayâ€™ to Dadâ€�.
Critics said the police were overzealous in publicly criticising the MP, as others warned they could could lose the respect of the public. Don Morgan tweeted: â€œThis looks very wrong ....focus on the big stuff â€¦ not trivia ... this will lose you public support at a time when itâ€™s really going to be needed.â€� Walkies Cleo added: â€œLooking after vulnerable relatives is indeed essential so well done Stephen. You delivered essential supplies, checked they were ok, all from a safe distance. @SWpolice you should be disgusted with your post, doing your force no favours and will lose all respect with public!!â€� However, others agreed with South Wales police, saying the MP was setting a bad example to others. Bleddyn Dunn wrote: â€œWhatâ€™s the travel distance? Why didnâ€™t you leave these â€˜suppliesâ€™ at the door and leave. Thatâ€™s what most people are doing, including me for my Dad. I wished my Dad happy birthday over the phone on Thursday. â€œWhat youâ€™ve done is irresponsible and breaks the regulations set out by the government. Essential supplies can be left on the doorstep, you donâ€™t need to take chairs along and photograph yourself. You should just take the L on this oneâ€�, added Twitter user JC. The MPâ€™s sister, Rachel, could also face admonishment from police after she tweeted that she had visited her parents to deliver a â€œcake, a crumble and a lamb curry!â€�
It comes as a 13-year-old boy was arrested and his mother was â€œdealt withâ€� as police forces across the country were given new powers to detain people failing to comply with coronavirus lockdown rules. Ste Richardson, a senior section officer for West Yorkshire police, arrested the teenager under emergency legislation introduced on Thursday, which granted police powers to issue Â£60 on-the-spot fines or make arrests for breaches of the UKâ€™s coronavirus rules. The officer, who is based in Leeds, said on social media the boy had refused to give him any details and he had had â€œno choiceâ€� but to arrest him. It is unclear how the child had broken the lockdown rules. In a now-deleted tweet, Richardson wrote: â€œToday I arrested a 13 year old male under the new coronavirus powers. The male refused to give me any details so I could take him home under the Act. He was arrested and taken to custody. His mother was dealt with for being a responsible person failing to comply.â€� Ken Marsh, the head of the Metropolitan Police Federation, has previously said that the parents of older teenagers should be forced to pay fines if they were caught ignoring government guidance. Elsewhere, a motorist was stopped by a motorway patrol on a 224-mile round trip to buy an item from eBay â€“ with his wife in the boot, police said. The driver travelled from Coventry to collect the eBay purchase of windows in Salford, Greater Manchester, despite the public being warned only to make essential journeys due to the coronavirus pandemic. After they picked up his purchase in Salford, the driverâ€™s wife could not fit in the vehicle for the two-hour return journey south. She was travelling in the boot of the car when they were pulled over by a motorway patrol on the M6 in Cheshire, according to a tweet by the North West Motorway Police Twitter feed. Officers wrote out a traffic offence report for the driver. On Friday, Derbyshire police were criticised after releasing drone footage of walkers at a beauty spot along with the warning that such exercise did not constitute â€œessential travelâ€�. At the weekend the same force took the step of dying the normally clear waters of a picturesque quarry near Buxton black in an attempt to deter people from visiting.
In North Yorkshire police have been carrying out spot checks near Harrogate and said checkpoints could appear anywhere, any time. Roadblocks were also set up in Plymouth, Devon, while in Cornwall 150 vehicles were checked in Penzance, Hayle and St Ives. In Northern Ireland, police were preparing to target tourist sites and visitor locations, as they adopted new rules at 11pm on Saturday. Northern Ireland was the last part of the UK to develop regulations flowing from the new powers. Officers across the UK have issued fines less than 24 hours after new laws were brought into force, the National Police Chiefsâ€™ Council said. Those who ignore the tougher restrictions on movement could be hit with a Â£60 fine initially â€“ reduced to Â£30 if paid within 14 days â€“ and another for Â£120 for a second offence. Fines could reach Â£1,000-plus for repeat offenders. Derbyshire police said they broke up a â€œmassive partyâ€� on Saturday night involving 25 adults and children. The Derby West response section of the force tweeted: â€œOfficers have just attended an address in absolute shock to find 25 adults and children having a massive party with speakers and karaoke. Everyone dispersed and hosts dealt with. It is clear people are still having complete disregard for the Government advice and rules.â€� In Surrey, police broke up a house party in the Stanwell area, while in Cornwall walkers were criticised for ignoring lockdown advice and pouring into rural villages. A spokesperson for Devon and Cornwall police said they were receiving regular reports from people concerned about others flouting the lockdown rules with about five calls an hour since 10am on Saturday. Many forces have created hotlines to submit tip-offs about people allegedly flouting the social distancing rules, including gatherings of more than two people. West Midlands, Greater Manchester, and Avon and Somerset have also established online forums for those keen to report rule-breakers."

2020-03-29T14:06:40Z,politics,Politics,Alex Salmond’s QC to be investigated ‘after naming trial women’,"Scotland’s most senior lawyer, who defended Alex Salmond at his sexual assault trial, has referred himself to the country’s legal watchdog after footage emerged that appears to show him identifying the complainants on a busy commuter train. Last week a jury at the high court in Edinburgh found the former first minister not guilty of 12 sexual assaults, including one attempted rape. It also concluded that another charge of intent to rape was “not proven”, a Scottish legal formulation which stops short of a not guilty verdict but finds the accused innocent in the eyes of the law. During and since the trial, the nine women who alleged assaults by the former Scottish National party leader have faced an onslaught of abuse online and on Sunday morning released a joint statement in which they described their “devastation” at the verdict. It is understood that they have been issued with personal alarms and have been offered home security checks by police. Gordon Jackson QC was condemned for his “horrifying and completely unacceptable” comments after the Sunday Times reported he had been overheard making the remarks on board an Edinburgh to Glasgow train during the first week of the trial and that his conversation had been filmed by a passenger.
Jackson, who is dean of the Faculty of Advocates, appears to name two of the women who alleged sexual assaults by Salmond, in contravention of rules that protect the anonymity of complainers – as they are known in Scotland – in such cases. Sandy Brindley, the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, called for an investigation, saying: “Protecting the anonymity of all people who report sexual crimes is of critical importance and is one of few reassurances that can be offered as part of an otherwise daunting and intimidating process. “For this to be undermined by such a senior lawyer in a public place in such a high-profile trial is horrifying and completely unacceptable. Jackson is dean of the Faculty of Advocates and we cannot see how this behaviour – caught on film – is in keeping with the Faculty of Advocates’ own guidance on conduct. There should be an immediate investigation.” In the footage, Jackson can be heard saying: “This is hardly sexual … sex offenders register? Not for you. Inappropriate, arsehole, stupid … but sexual? Unfortunately, [names one complainer] and [names another complainer] say it’s sexual.” Jackson also says of Salmond: “I don’t know much about senior politicians but he was quite an objectionable bully to work with in a way I don’t think Nicola [Sturgeon] is. I think he was a nasty person to work for … a nightmare to work for.” Referring to one complainer, he says: “We thought that eventually people might think she’s a flake and not like her,” and goes on to discusses his defence tactics with another woman, saying: “All I need to do is put a smell on her.” Brindley said: “One of the most chilling aspects of this is Jackson’s statement about his strategy for the cross-examination of one of the women in the trial: ‘All I need to do is put a smell on her.’ This statement alone confirms the fears of many who do not report for fear of what would be done to them in court. We need an urgent overhaul of how these cases are dealt with.” In a statement released on Twitter, Jackson said: “I have decided that the proper course of action is to self-refer this matter to the Scottish Legal Complaints Commission, and that has been done. It will be for the Commission to consider this matter.
“I also deeply regret the distress and difficulties which have been caused, but given the reference to the SLCC it would not be appropriate to comment further.” A spokesperson for Salmond: “Mr Salmond … made a statement on the steps of the high court and said that he would make no further public comment on these matters until after the coronavirus crisis was over.”"
2020-03-29T11:21:11Z,politics,Politics,Michael Gove appears to blame China over lack of UK coronavirus testing,"Michael Gove has appeared to lay the blame for the UK’s lack of mass testing on China, raising the prospect of increased diplomatic tension between the two countries. Some of China’s reports on the virus were unclear about the “scale, nature and infectiousness” of the disease, the cabinet minister told the BBC. Asked on BBC One’s Andrew Marr show why Britain did not have sufficient testing, despite the first case in China being known about in December, Gove said: “We’ve been increasing the number of tests over the course of the last month. “It was the case … [that] the first case of coronavirus in China was established in December of last year, but it was also the case that some of the reporting from China was not clear about the scale, the nature, the infectiousness of this.” The Mail on Sunday reported that senior Downing Street officials and ministers expect a “reckoning” with China over misinformation in relation to the outbreak. It also claimed there was anger over perceived attempts by China to exploit the crisis for economic gain. Gove announced that the UK had reached its initial target of testing 10,000 people a day for coronavirus. The aim is to raise the rate to 25,000 a day, but he did not give a timeline. Asked why there was still no fixed date for the rollout of mass testing , he said only that the government was setting the NHS Nightingale field hospital to free up the capacity of the equivalent of 50 hospitals. It was put to Gove that Germany was carrying out half a million tests a week while NHS workers in the UK still did not know when they would get a test. He said: “It’s certainly the case that the Germans have had success in testing. The acceleration here in the UK is significant. If one looks at, and this is not the way to look at it, but if one looks at a league table then the UK is rising up it. “We’ve managed to test significantly more of our citizens as a percentage than some other countries but frankly the most important thing is not to look backwards but to look forwards and to do everything that we can to increase the number of tests.”
The UK lockdown was expected to continue for a “significant period”, Gove suggested in another interview, and he said he was unable to give a fixed date on when it would end. The expected date of the peak of the disease was also unknown, he said. Speaking to the Sophy Ridge on Sunday show on Sky News, he said: “As a result of the social distancing measures the government has implemented, we hope we can reduce the rate of infection, but at this stage we just need to make sure everyone observes those rules.”
Dame Donna Kinnair, the chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, told the same programme that up to 20% of health workers were out of the workforce because they were self-isolating, and testing was needed as soon as possible. She said: “I believe [testing] should have happened sooner but we are where we are and we need it now. So nurses are every day carrying out services to patients or care and treatment to patients and they will be less than one metre away, so they particularly need to know whether the person they are dealing with, whether they themselves, have been infected with Covid-19 so that they can take the appropriate time off but also protect themselves and their families.”"
2020-03-29T06:33:47Z,politics,Politics,Alex Salmond’s accusers urge other women to ‘be brave’,"Nine women who made complaints of sexual offences against Alex Salmond have urged other women to “be brave, be loud, be heard” in the face of bullying, sexual harassment and assault, in a powerful rebuke to those who have accused them of conspiring against the former Scottish National party leader. Last week a jury at the high court in Edinburgh found the former first minister not guilty of 12 sexual assaults, including one attempted rape. It also concluded that another charge of intent to rape was “not proven”, a Scottish legal formulation which stops short of a not guilty verdict, but finds the accused innocent in the eyes of the law. All verdicts were by majority, following an 11-day trial. Salmond was formally acquitted of one sexual assault charge midway through the court case after it was withdrawn by the prosecution. The nine different women, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and who included Scottish government officials and SNP employees, described in court alleged assaults, many of which they claimed took place late at night in the private rooms of the first minister’s official residence, Bute House. Salmond denied all their allegations, describing them variously as “reinterpretations”, “exaggerations”, and “deliberate fabrications for political purposes”. In a highly unusual move, reflecting the frustration the complainants feel at being characterised as co-conspirators, the women have set out their response to the verdicts, which they describe as “devastating”. In a joint statement signed jointly by all nine women who testified against Salmond, they write: “We remain firm in our belief that coming forward to report our experiences and concerns was the right thing to do.” The women insist that they are still not in direct contact with each other, and that they do not know the identities of all their fellow complainers. The statement was released by Rape Crisis Scotland. Describing the trial as “a traumatic process”, the statement continues: “As politicians, commentators and society reflect on this case, we would ask you to consider whether behaviour which is so often merely described as ‘inappropriate’ or is tolerated by society, is acceptable towards your daughters, granddaughters, sisters, wives, friends, and colleagues.” During and since the trial, the women have faced an onslaught of abuse online and have been issued with personal alarms by the police. They add: “We would also request that as you debate, you conduct it respectfully and stay mindful of the many women in Scotland who may have had traumatic experiences and are considering whether or not Scotland is a country in which they can come forward to seek help and support.” Immediately after the verdict, Salmond’s allies called for prominent officials in Nicola Sturgeon’s office and the Scottish National party to be fired after text messages and emails came to light that Salmond argues raises serious questions about their role in the case, and their handling of allegations against him, including the botched Scottish government internal inquiry into complaints of sexual misconduct brought against him by two civil servants in 2018. Salmond is now expected to sue the Scottish government and wants to put his case to the Holyrood inquiry into the handling of the initial allegations. Salmond’s defence was that the allegations had been orchestrated by one of the complainers, witness A, a senior official in the Scottish government, while others had been exaggerated. Giving evidence, Salmond admitted with hindsight he wished he had been “more careful with people’s personal space”, while his defence lawyer Gordon Jackson QC described his behaviour as “inappropriate” and “touchy-feely” during cross-examination. Since the verdict, Salmond’s own former speechwriter described his defence as “I’m sleazy but not criminal”. The women write: “In defending Alex Salmond, Gordon Jackson quoted Woman H and said his client should have been a ‘better man’. He said behaviour which others described as demeaning, intimidating and humiliating, was ‘trivial’. The behaviours that Alex Salmond and his defence team admitted to in evidence were not and are not trivial”. Today we want to send a strong and indisputable message that such behaviours should not be tolerated – by any person, in any position, under any circumstances.” Thanking Police Scotland, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service “for taking our experiences seriously and for allowing our voices to be heard”, they assert: “Many of us did speak up at the time of our incidents but were faced with procedures that could not deal with complaints against such a powerful figure. Others were silenced by fear of repercussions.” The trial raised serious questions about the way the civil service and the SNP dealt with complaints. In their evidence, some of the women said they feared making formal complaints would damage their careers or that the matter would be “swept under the carpet”. The court also heard from a number of witnesses who said that Salmond’s behaviour led to an unofficial ban on him working alone with female civil servants at Bute House late at night. After a junior official accused Salmond of forcing her on to a bed in December 2013 – a charge Salmond denied, stating instead that the pair had “a sleepy cuddle” – the jury heard that instead of an investigation, civil service officials and Salmond’s most senior aide brokered a private apology from the first minister. The women’s statement argues that “for too long, women have been let down by organisational structures which should exist to protect them”. “We should all seek to create an environment in which people can challenge and report behaviours without hesitation or fear of retribution.” Their statement concludes: “While we are devastated by the verdict, we will not let it define us. We hope through shining a light on our experiences, it will serve to protect and empower women in the future.”"

2020-03-28T16:04:29Z,politics,Politics,Labour asked leadership rivals to pre-record victory speeches,"Candidates for the roles of Labour leader and deputy leader reacted with disbelief after being told they all had to pre-record their own victory statements before the result is announced next weekend. The name of the next Labour leader and deputy leader will be revealed at 10.45am on Saturday in an emailed press release from the party, after plans for a grand coronation were abandoned as a result of the coronavirus crisis. Under plans hammered out by the party over recent days, the outcome of the three-month contest will be emailed to the media, and more than 500,000 party members who were eligible to vote, with a link to a recorded acceptance speech by the winner. It emerged, however, that all three candidates for leader – Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy – and the five contesting the role of deputy had all been asked to record speeches by this Wednesday, as if they had just heard they had won. One of those in the contest told the Observer: “The first thing they wanted to do was announce it with us all in a Zoom call which was never going to work. “Then they came up with the idea of us all recording victory speeches in advance which is just completely ridiculous. It is like the X Factor. Imagine what would happen if any one of these recordings got into the public domain, with us laying out our plans for the future and saying how wonderful it felt to have won. The unrealistic nature of it all just about sums up the last five years.” Another candidate said: “It is impossible to see how anyone can record something in advance like this with any conviction. It is not going to happen.” It is now expected that some other method will be found so that brief acceptance speeches can be made on the day of the announcement by the two winners. Under the current plans the candidates to succeed outgoing leader Jeremy Corbyn and his former deputy Tom Watson will be informed of the result a few minutes before it is made public. The deputy leadership is being contested by Angela Rayner, Rosena Allin-Khan, Richard Burgon, Ian Murray and Dawn Butler. The original plan had to been to gather at least 1,000 party members and senior figures at a special conference in London to announce the new leader. Starmer is the bookies’ favourite to win the contest for leader while Angela Rayner is regarded by many as frontrunner for the deputy post. On Friday Rayner announced she was “self-isolating” after suffering symptoms of coronavirus. She said on Twitter: “I am now in self isolation as I have the symptoms of #Coronavirus they started last night and have gradually got worse. I will be a bit quieter than usual but will still be keeping in touch with people as best as l can.” In an interview with the BBC’s Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg on Friday, Corbyn said the country had been “ill-prepared” for the coronavirus pandemic because of “10 years of austerity, of underfunding the National Health Service and underfunding our benefit system”."
2020-03-28T13:19:28Z,politics,Politics,Alister Jack is third UK cabinet member to self-isolate during Covid-19 outbreak,"A third member of Boris Johnson’s cabinet is self-isolating after developing coronavirus symptoms. Alister Jack, the secretary of state for Scotland, said he had not been tested for Covid-19 but had a temperature and a cough. “In the past 24 hours, I have developed mild symptoms associated with coronavirus. In line with medical guidance, I am self-isolating and working from home,” he said.
His announcement comes after the prime minister and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, confirmed on Friday that they had tested positive for Covid-19. England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, also revealed that he had symptoms. All three have said they will also continue in their roles while working from home. Johnson is likely to face further criticism after public health experts on Friday accused him of failing to heed his own advice to the public on how to contain the coronavirus.
Jack sat between Johnson and Hancock during prime minister’s questions on Wednesday. The government has recommended everyone keep two metres apart to prevent the spread of the virus. Dr John Ashton, a former regional director of Public Health England, said on Friday: “The government has been too slow to act on this, and they’ve been slow as individuals. I was surprised to see prime minister questions going ahead this week. It was clearly unnecessary. “It reinforces the view that lockdown measures taken earlier this week should have been taken sooner, and raises questions about the ability of people in power, including the prime minister, to discipline themselves. They should all have been more careful.” Parliament has now closed for four weeks after the planned Easter recess was brought forward over concerns about the spread of the virus. MPs and peers will not return to until 21 April at the earliest, in what may be a limited form. The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, said that “virtual parliament and virtual select committees” could be a possibility as he announced the extended recess on Wednesday evening. Johnson said in a video message that he would continue to lead efforts to slow the virus’s spread from his flat above No 11 Downing Street. Concerns are rife that other key government figures might be affected. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was with the PM shortly before he tested positive. The cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, was also with Johnson, Hancock and Whitty at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Neither had displayed symptoms by Friday night, so they had not been tested and were not in isolation."

Testing is to be extended to frontline NHS workers, with hundreds to be carried out this weekend, Michael Gove announced. This will be antigen testing â€“ testing whether people currently have the disease â€“ and will be increased â€œdramaticallyâ€� next week. Testing criteria is based on show symptoms and the centrality of oneâ€™s role to the coronavirus crisis. Two further NHS Nightingale hospitals will be built in Birmingham and Manchester. NHS England has also reconfigured hospital services so that 33,000 hospital beds are available to treat further patients. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, also tested positive for coronavirus after having mild symptoms. He will self-isolate until next Thursday. Englandâ€™s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, is self-isolating after experiencing symptoms compatible with Covid-19. He will continue to advise the governmentâ€™s medical response to coronavirus, supported by his deputies. The UK death toll rose by 181 to 759, the highest day-on-day increase so far, and the rate of infection has been doubling every three to four days. Michael Gove announced that 113,777 people have now been tested for Covid-19; of those 14,543 have tested positive, an increase in the last day of 2,885. There were 168 more deaths in England, a further three in Northern Ireland, six more recorded in Wales, and a further eight in Scotland. A temporary mortuary is to be opened at Birmingham Airport in preparation for a predicted rise in the number of fatalities from coronavirus in the region. Work has begun on the site, which will initially be able to hold 1,500 bodies, although it will be expanded to hold more. Thatâ€™s it for today from the UK side.

2020-03-27T17:52:20Z,politics,Politics,British firms to be given more protection from bankruptcy,"British companies struggling amid the coronavirus outbreak are to be given greater protection from bankruptcy under emergency changes to insolvency laws due to be unveiled by the government this weekend, the Guardian has learned. Ministers are preparing to announce measures to give firms greater leeway to continue trading, including offering them more protection from creditors in effort to prevent mass company failures and a sharp rise in unemployment. Sources said the government planned a rapid shakeup of insolvency laws to bring in rules similar to chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US, which give firms time to pay off their debts over time while remaining in business. The sources said the business secretary, Alok Sharma, would amend “wrongful trading” rules, which make it a criminal offence for a company director to keep on trading if they know the business is unable to repay its debts. The government has already announced a series of unprecedented policies to try to prevent the downturn created by the pandemic from turning into a slump, with Boris Johnson promising the nation would “put its arms around every worker”. News this week that 477,000 people had submitted new claims for universal credit sparked fears that unemployment is already rocketing, as businesses who have had to close their doors as a result of stringent social distancing measures have laid off staff. As growing numbers of companies come under financial stress, the fresh steps could help to prevent normally healthy companies from going bust. Experts said the measures could also include a moratorium on the ability of company creditors to force firms to wind up their operations. Roger Barker, head of corporate governance at the Institute of Directors, which has been pushing for changes, said: “A lot of companies will want to carry on and to maintain employment, take out emergency loans with government backing. But if at some future point they could be held personally liable for not putting their firms into insolvency, that may cause them not to carry on. “At the current time of emergency we need as many companies as possible to keep going, providing employment and providing goods and services keep the economy going.” The radical shakeup of the bankruptcy regime would require legislation and would be likely to require MPs to return to Westminster after recess, despite suggestions that the Easter break could be extended. The Liberal Democrat leadership contender Layla Moran, who has called for a more lenient bankruptcy regime during the crisis, said that would be the right thing if it allowed some firms to weather the storm. “This change would require legislation but we would have the political will to make it happen. We must do this, jobs are on the line,” she said. Some companies have been criticised for continuing to trade during the crisis, though there has also been widespread confusion about which economic activities must be curtailed as a result of the government’s rules. In his broadcast on Monday evening, the prime minister urged the public to stay at home but also said they could travel to work if their job was essential and they were unable to work from home. The government has so far declined to order construction work to halt, with Johnson insisting he does not want to “shut down the economy”."
2020-03-27T17:26:33Z,politics,Politics,How will the UK function with a sick prime minister?,"Cabinet government had for most of this week already been replaced by Zoom government, but the fact that Boris Johnson has contracted coronavirus, and so been forced to self-distance himself from the nation that he rules, raises awkward questions about how the government control room will operate at probably its most testing moment. No 10 has offered the reassurance that Johnson, rather than his deputy, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, will if possible remain in charge, making the vital decisions in physical isolation in his flat in No 11 for the next week, connected to colleagues only by technology. If so, it brings a new meaning to the oft-repeated dictum that it is lonely at the top. The promise that Johnson will remain in charge may be true, or just a holding operation designed to portray an air of serenity in these most abnormal and panicky times. This is an illness that can knock the fittest figure sideways, so it is too early to say how far he will be driven into his bunker. Johnson is also someone who thrives in direct personal contact with others, cheering up a room and instinctively reading the mood of the meeting or the audience before coming to a view. It is said he does his boxes, but values a discussion more.
Yet the political leader as recluse is something other countries have absorbed. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, has been in isolation for a week after his wife, Sophie, contracted the virus, leaving him in sole charge of three children and a country bordering Donald Trump. He works from his study and ventures out each day on to the doorstep of his home to hold a press conference. No one else enters except for a single technician with rubber gloves to fix up a G7 Zoom conference. No red boxes, but a box of Lego has been delivered. His children, his aides say, have occasionally been told to shush because “Daddy is on an important call right now.” But in Canada, it was only the prime minister’s wife who was incapacitated. In the UK, the virus has hit the bullseye. The civil service has experience of working its way round vacuums in power, and Johnson is not the first British leader to be incapacitated in government. Tony Blair needed time off for a heart operation, prompting Lord Levy’s wife, Gild, to send him chicken soup, and Clement Attlee’s knee joints became so rickety he could not broach stairs. While the Suez crisis cannot be blamed solely on a high fever, Anthony Eden, suffering from an infection of the liver ducts due to a botched operation, became excessively reliant on amphetamines during the autumn of 1956, which might go some way towards explaining his series of miscalculations. Theresa May struggled with diabetes as well as Brexit. Harold Wilson resigned prematurely, sensing that mental exhaustion had overtaken him. Johnson’s own great hero, Winston Churchill, suffered two serious illnesses during the second world war, first in February 1943 and then in August 1944. On the first occasion, after an eight-and-a-half-hour flight from Algiers, he came down with a cold and sore throat. It took two doctors – his personal physician, Sir Charles Wilson, and Geoffrey Marshall, a physician at Guy’s hospital – to persuade him of the seriousness of his illness. Churchill spent a fortnight battling with doctors, nurses and civil servants to ensure that they sent him a steady supply of decisions to make. Even as far away as the US, he developed a reputation as “the world’s worst patient”. On the second occasion, he contracted pneumonia at the age of 70, an illness so potentially serious that his condition was never made public. Again, the supply of papers to his bedroom was curtailed, with only the most critical allowed to enter his chamber. At times Churchill flew into a rage when he realised how much was being held back from him. Johnson, unlike some of his aides, probably does not seek to monopolise power and has not been in office long enough to have adopted a definitive governing style. The outbreak of the virus had prompted a reorganisation of his administration in which he was at the apex. Four subcommittees reported to him, marking a formal centralisation of power in No 10 and the Cabinet Office. So his absence will be felt.
On the other hand, the ship of state’s broad course has now been set after an initial fortnight of confusion. No matter how hard the headwinds, no great adjustment is planned, so it is not the worst moment for the captain to be forced below deck. Two great qualities will be demanded in the next fortnight. The first is a tireless focus on implementing the decisions taken, the remorseless grind of following through and making sure the Whitehall machine delivers. Any minister at the heart of the response to the financial crash in 2008 will recall the sensation of pulling a policy lever in Whitehall, only to realise the lever was entirely disconnected from the real world. Decisions taken and announced are not decisions implemented. Johnson’s forte is not in enforcement, so he will not be missed in that department. The Treasury, Work and Pensions, Revenue & Customs and health and business are the lead ministries. But if Johnson is truly forced to leave the scene for more than a week, and the national death toll mounts, he will be missed as the person to reassure the nation that recovery is in sight. David Cameron described it as “the sunny uplands” passage of a speech. It is not a speech that can be delivered from a sickbed."
2020-03-27T16:05:13Z,politics,Politics,Chancellor's coronavirus bailout ignores many self-employed,"Thousands of self-employed people – in particular those working in the creative industries – who set up limited companies have been “devastated” by being excluded from the chancellor’s bailout. On Thursday night Rishi Sunak said the government would pay self-employed workers 80% of their profits – up to £2,500 a month – for three months, starting in June. He said the measure was “one of the most generous schemes anywhere in the world” and would help 95% of the self-employed. A similar scheme has already been offered to employees. However, it has emerged that the latest scheme will not help anyone who has set up a sole-person limited company, meaning thousands of freelance writers, photographers and others working in the creative arts will get no help from it. The Guardian has been contacted by several of those affected, who say this will ruin them financially. They will be covered for 80% their salary by the coronavirus job retention scheme if they are operating PAYE schemes, or face having to claim universal credit instead, with its far lower payouts.
Thousands of actors, designers, film crew and others found themselves out of work and unpaid when the government introduced its coronavirus restrictions. One of those is a sound engineer who does work for documentaries for the BBC and Netflix. All his projects are on hold and his work has evaporated, he said. “This is a disaster for thousands of people like me,” the worker, who did not want to be named, told the Guardian, after two hours on while calling the universal credit phone line. “I was advised to set up the limited company as it was a tax-efficient way to operate, and because it makes processing payments much simpler. Many who work in this world have done the same. We are just as self-employed as those being helped, but inexplicably find ourselves left out the scheme. It’s devastating.”
Brian Palmer, a tax policy expert at the Association of Accounting Technicians, said this group was stuck in the middle of the two bailout schemes. “Many of this group draw a low salary and top up their income with dividends. They will not qualify as self-employed, or for a significant payment from the coronavirus job retention scheme. Instead, they risk dropping through the cracks,” he said. “We must ensure that everyone gets the support they need to stay afloat and that the UK economy is able to not only recover, but also to thrive.” Heather Self, a partner at the accounting and business advisory services Blick Rothenberg, agreed this group was likely to be feeling left behind. “The government and HMRC have worked incredibly hard to get something out which will help the majority, but there are some losers.’,” she said. “A family with one earner on £51,000 will get nothing, whereas another with two people earning £49,000 each will get two lots of support. Someone with a mix of self-employed and earned income also may not qualify.” The Treasury has been approached for comment."
2020-03-27T14:54:53Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer had no enemies. Can he keep it that way?,"When John Erskine signed up a teenage Keir Starmer to the Labour club at Leeds University freshers’ week in 1982, he had hoped to find a new recruit in the factional dogfight raging inside the party. But he was disappointed. Erskine recalls the young law student’s politics as being of the “non-aligned, conscience-driven left” – something like a kind of political Methodism. Instead of joining in the running battles with Militant, Starmer took the view there were “no enemies on the left” and cracked on with his studies. The overwhelming favourite to succeed Jeremy Corbyn, who steps down next weekend, Starmer has defied categorisation, declining to become a fully paid-up member of any of Labour’s many overlapping sects. He is neither a Corbynite nor a Blairite (to the extent that they still exist) and is irritated by other people’s urge to pigeon-hole him. Speaking to the Guardian as he launched his pitch for the leadership last December, he said: “I don’t find the badging of people helps, really. I don’t need somebody else’s name tattooed on my head to know what I think. There are fundamental principles.” Starmer arrived at Leeds from Reigate grammar school, the only one of five siblings from a modest semi-detached house in Oxted, Surrey, to get to university. He has spoken movingly about his mother’s 50-year battle with Still’s disease, which ultimately led to her being confined to a wheelchair and unable to eat. “She wouldn’t have moaned. If you’d asked her how she was, she’d say ‘fine, how are you?’,” he said. After a postgraduate degree at Oxford, Starmer moved to London where he shared a rickety flat in Archway with old school friends. He joined the fashionably radical Doughty Street Chambers while carrying out pro-bono work for a string of apparently lost causes. Conor Foley, an international human rights lawyer and aid worker who now lives in Brazil, worked alongside Starmer at the campaign group Amnesty International in the 90s. The pair wrote a pamphlet, Foreign Policy, Human Rights and the UK, in 1998, making a string of recommendations, many of which were subsequently taken up by the Labour government. Tony Blair’s incorporation of the provisions of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) into UK law in the Human Rights Act catapulted Starmer and his fellow human rights lawyers from the lefty fringe of their profession to the mainstream, as the judiciary scrambled to absorb its implications. “There were various people who were, three years before, on the unacceptable left, suddenly found themselves in positions of authority,” says Conor Gearty, a professor of human rights law at the LSE and another old friend. “Because we knew about it and nobody else did.” Foley agrees. “The Human Rights Act - there are probably four or five people in Britain who got that legislation and understood the importance of that legislation, and Keir and I were two of them. There were other people who played a more prominent role. But he has always understood the strategic significance of international human rights law.” Foley says that while the pair were working together at Amnesty he didn’t sense any burning ambition in Starmer to enter party politics. “That wasn’t where we were at. I think he wanted to be a human rights lawyer. I think that was really his dream.” And anyway the Labour party of the time wasn’t much to their liking, he says. “The Blairite party wouldn’t have been something either of us were comfortable with. Not that we were anti, we just weren’t that comfortable with it.” Starmer’s appointment as director of public prosecutions (DPP) – a campaigning human rights lawyer turned the nation’s chief prosecutor – surprised some of his radical friends. Leftwing critics tend to describe his five-year stint at the top of the 6,000-strong Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) as the final stage in Starmer’s metamorphosis from firebrand QC to well-coiffed pillar of the establishment. They point to the all-night court sittings held to administer swift punishment to the 2011 rioters – which Starmer subsequently claimed had helped quell the disorder; and tough prosecuting guidance that imposed sentences of up to 10 years on benefits fraudsters.
Some individual cases are also regularly raised, though Starmer’s friends insist they are impossible to judge without knowing what advice he received at the time. The decision not to prosecute the policeman involved in the death of Ian Tomlinson in the G20 protests was widely criticised at the time, not least by Tomlinson’s stepson, Paul King. “He [Starmer] has just admitted on TV that a copper assaulted our dad. But he hasn’t done anything. He’s the man in charge ... why hasn’t he charged him?” But Starmer insisted there was no realistic chance of a successful prosecution. His decision was subsequently reversed after an inquest found that Tomlinson had been unlawfully killed, but the police officer, Simon Harwood, was ultimately cleared of manslaughter in 2012. Gearty defends Starmer’s overall record at the CPS, saying he managed to forge new policy ground by developing frameworks of guidance in controversial areas such as assisted dying, alongside the traditional role of making decisions on individual cases. “That is such a hard thing for any of us to do: to be both reactive, and also to have the capacity to be able to engage and drive the agenda.” Both of these skills should have better prepared him for life in Westminster. But his legal background hasn’t enamoured him to everyone. He was persuaded to run for parliament in 2015 in part by his longtime friend Ed Miliband, whose London home is not far up the Northern line from the Victorian terrace in Kentish Town that Starmer shares with his wife, Vicky, and two children. Labour appeared set to win, and he told his local paper, the Ham and High: “I’ve got my eyes set on winning Holborn and St Pancras and then doing whatever I can do to help a Labour government change the things that need changing.” Instead he found himself in a parliamentary party relegated to opposition and wracked with division.
During the darkest days of the Brexit drama, when Labour became embroiled in one parliamentary clash after another, Starmer was often criticised by colleagues for being too much a lawyer and not enough a politician. One shadow cabinet colleague laughingly cites his resignation as shadow immigration minister in 2016, at the later stages of the mass exodus from Jeremy Corbyn’s team in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, as an example of his lawyerliness. “It’s a classic – you have to read it three times to see what he’s saying.” In it, Starmer said the “challenge of leadership” was different in the light of the referendum result, but that he had “maintained his support” for the embattled Corbyn until most of his team resigned. “It is simply untenable now to suggest that we can offer an effective opposition without a change of leader,” he concluded. Whatever his qualms about the leadership, Starmer made the fateful choice to go back on to the frontbench in October 2016 after Corbyn convincingly saw off Owen Smith’s challenge. In the following three years he played a crucial – and, to some colleagues, infuriating – role in inching his party towards supporting a second EU referendum. He chaired the “compositing” meeting of grassroots delegates at the 2018 conference in Liverpool that resulted in a referendum finding its way into Labour policy as an “option” that should remain “on the table”. He earned rapturous applause from the remain-supporting membership when he used his speech to drop in the idea – then anathema to the leadership – that if another poll were held, remain would have to be on the ballot paper. There followed many months of parliamentary wrangling with the Tories in public, and political clashes among Labour’s most senior figures in private. Starmer styled himself as the torchbearer for the composite – and thus for the idea that a referendum couldn’t be ruled out. In public, he stuck scrupulously to the letter of every iteration of Labour policy. But in private, says one shadow cabinet colleague, the discussions were more robust. “He stretched the case as far as he could go but not to a point where he could be said to be out of line. But in the private meetings he was pushing very much harder. At every stage, we felt, and I said this many times, this is just a fucking ratchet.” Some former MPs who lost their seats in pro-Brexit constituencies blame Starmer, in part, for the party’s policy, which took many months of wrangling to arrive at and which infuriated leave voters. He insists it was a sensible way of dealing with a deeply divided party, with a deeply divided electorate, that once arrived at was not explained or sold to the public. Certainly he made few frontline media appearances during the campaign, instead touring local constituencies to boost morale with members and candidates, a role he had also played in 2017, awarding himself the moniker Captain Marginal. Is he now more politician than lawyer? Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the House of Lords, who has sat in the shadow cabinet throughout Starmer’s time in parliament, believes so. “I don’t think anybody who’s dealt with the Labour party, the shadow cabinet, the issues that he’s dealt with over the past few years, could be accused of not being a politician,” Lady Smith says. “He’s not the kind of weirdly Machiavellian type some people associate with the word politician, but he gets the politics of an issue.” Erskine, who has watched Starmer’s progress from afar since the Leeds days, says “everything is of a piece. It’s of conscience, it’s about incredible intellectual rigour, it’s about being measured. And whilst it’s not me, I have a lot of respect for it.” That measured style until recently appeared out of political fashion. Whatever Corbyn’s shortcomings, he was capable of rousing passion in his army of supporters. Even Starmer’s most staunch supporters concede that is not really his style. One old friend recalls asking him to make a speech to a school about how he had risen from a pebble-dashed semi in Oxted to the top of his profession. It was an inspirational story, he recalls, but not an inspirational speech. “He’s no David Lammy, Keir.” Another cites what they recall as a serviceable but not outstanding address at the funeral of his predecessor in the Holborn and St Pancras seat, Frank Dobson, last December, with the great and the good of the Labour party, including four past and present leaders, in the congregation. One mourner recalls a non-plussed Labour grandee muttering afterwards: “That’s the trouble with Keir: he doesn’t rise to the occasion.” But Smith, who has seen Starmer up close over the past five years, has little sympathy for those who complain that he lacks pizzazz. “I get quite irritated when people talk about him being dull. He’s serious – and I rather like people being serious, particularly when you’re dealing with serious issues,” she says. And with politics-as-usual on hold as the world wrestles with Covid-19 and its consequences – which have already swept decades-long orthodoxies in their wake – she adds: “He’s a serious grownup politician. I think he’s the right person at the right time.”"
2020-03-27T13:49:48Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson has coronavirus. Why do politicians seem prone to it?,"Boris Johnson may have given up shaking hands more than a week ago, but it is not in the nature or the craft of politicians to keep their physical distance from other people. In this time of isolation, it seems political leaders are more prone than most to bend the rules, apparently unconvinced that they can lead over video link. Even as advice was going out from the NHS that we should all keep two metres apart, the prime minister was at his podium briefing the country within what looked like transmission range of his medical and scientific advisers.
Only latterly were they moved further apart, as were the journalists asking questions in Downing Street and the MPs in the House of Commons. Ironically, with most of the population in lockdown, it makes no difference to the rest of us whether the prime minister and MPs are working in Westminster or in the isolation of their study or bedroom at home. There are no MPs’ surgeries for people to visit and no tours of factories or openings of flower shows. The public will not see them in the flesh. All their business could be done on the phone and through meetings relayed on a computer screen.
But Johnson joins a list of politicians who have tested positive. His health secretary, Matt Hancock, has it too. Others to have tested positive include the Australian home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, the Iranian vice-president Massoumeh Ebtekar and the EU chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier. Prince Charles is not a politician, but contact with people is key to his role. They all have something in common: they are very unused to working, and being, alone. They are the people who are more likely to get a virus like Covid-19 – and potentially to spread it too. The more that people mix, the greater the risk to them. Most of the UK is now limited to social interaction within the home, which means for most, just a very few people. The police now have powers to stop and fine those who drive out for a walk in the hills, even if they are unlikely to meet anybody else on the journey or while exercising the dog. But that extreme caution does not appear to apply to those at Westminster.
While it is not good to have the prime minister in self-isolation, arguably it could be worse to have his medical and scientific advisers infected as a result of briefing him face to face. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser, are even more fundamental to the UK response to coronavirus. The academic whose modelling has done more than anything to influence the government’s decision to lock down the country, Prof Neil Ferguson from Imperial, is already ill. He was seen by video link earlier this week giving evidence to the science and technology select committee of MPs and had clearly not fully recovered. When he fell ill last week, he said on Twitter that “there is a lot of Covid-19 in Westminster”. He expanded on this in a phone interview on Radio 4, saying: “I’ve been in so many meetings in the last few weeks, and a number of my colleagues from other universities who have been advising the government in those meetings have also developed symptoms.” This week, he and others have given evidence from their homes to select committees and presumably been in virtual meetings with government advisers. It is very clear now that the coronavirus does not spare people in power. The succumbing of the prime minister may do more than anything else to change the way government works in a pandemic."
2020-03-27T13:48:45Z,politics,Politics,Survey of thousands of Home Office staff revives bullying row,"Thousands of Home Office employees claim they have been discriminated against, bullied or harassed at work, according to the results of a staff survey. The Home Office people survey, which was conducted in autumn 2019 and was completed by 21,095 employees, is part of a civil service-wide assessment. The results show 16% of respondents claimed they had been discriminated against at work in the past 12 months, roughly equating to 3,375 individuals. And 14% said they had been bullied or harassed at work in the same period, roughly equal to 2,950 employees. The survey results come shortly after bullying allegations erupted at the top of the Home Office, with the home secretary, Priti Patel, accused of belittling officials and presiding over an “atmosphere of fear”. Patel took up the post in July last year. Amid the allegations, Sir Philip Rutnam resigned as permanent secretary at the Home Office, claiming constructive dismissal and accusing Patel of bullying her subordinates. Separately, this month a review concluded that some of the failings that led to the Windrush scandal were caused by “institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race”. The independent reviewer, Wendy Williams, made a number of recommendations related to the issue of race, including regularly reviewing successful tribunal claims relating to race discrimination. Survey respondents gave a broad range of reasons why they felt they had been discriminated against in the previous 12 months, including 637 respondents who said they had been discriminated against on the grounds of age, 518 because of ethnic background and 547 for gender. Of those who claimed they had been bullied, 1,444 said the nature of bullying was “negative micromanagement eg excessive control; made to feel incompetent”, while 1,242 respondents said they had been “humiliated in front of team or others”. The majority of complainants – 1,227 – said they had been bullied by a colleague in the same area, directorate or division. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Reports of bullying, harassment or discrimination are at their lowest levels since 2016 but we are constantly looking at ways in which we can improve our culture and enable our people to thrive. “The home secretary recently spoke of her determination to make the Home Office a better place to work and to put fairness, dignity and respect at the heart of its mission.”"
2020-03-26T20:36:14Z,politics,Politics,Lucky-man Sunak dishes the dosh and eyes up Johnson's job | John Crace,"Some are born lucky, some achieve luckiness and others have luckiness thrust upon them. It’s not yet clear into which category Rishi Sunak might fall, but it’s looking entirely possible that the chancellor qualifies for all three. A hat-trick for which every chancellor in history would have sold their souls has landed gently in his lap. When Sunak became chancellor last month, he was widely written off as Boris Johnson’s poodle. The man who would happily sack all his special advisers and follow his master’s every word just to get his hands on one of the four main offices of state. How things change. Now it’s Rishi who looks the master and Boris the needy lapdog. Where Boris frequently looks a bit shifty, uncertain of the facts and prone to contradiction at the daily Downing Street press conference, Sunak was totally assured as he outlined his aid package for the self-employed. A prime minister in waiting – and probably not for very long. The coronavirus has been devastating for the country on almost every level. But for Sunak it has had one or two unexpected dividends. For every Conservative chancellor in history, the onus has been on prudence, balancing the books, low spending, low tax fiscal responsibility and – where possible – giving a little bit more to the most well-off members of society. But now the gloves are off. Sunak already had been given a bit of leeway to loosen the purse strings to prove Brexit a success, but now he has free licence to spend, spend, spend in a bid both to save the economy and protect people’s jobs. There is now a bottomless pit of money from which he could give a commitment to spend as much as was needed to see the country through the coronavirus pandemic. If you’re in trouble, Rishi’s your man. It can’t be long before he does a Jimmy McGill and changes his name to Saul Goodman. It goes without saying that if it had been a Labour chancellor who had been promising what could well be a £500bn bailout, then many Tory MPs would have been up in arms about the Marxist economics of mass state aid. Crisis or no crisis. But now the Tories believe in an Interventionist God. Or at least an Interventionist Chancellor, so because Sunak is one of them he gets a free pass. Better still, there are no downsides. He is a man of consequence who is blissfully free of consequences. Should the economy go into recession, then he can legitimately plead humanitarian priorities. And if Brexit should later go tits up, he can blame the coronavirus. It’s win-win. Where most chancellors are forced into the role of Scrooge, telling people why it’s good for their souls to be broke, Sunak is able to be the man on the street corner handing out free money. Providing you don’t look too hard at the small print. Having already provided a bailout package for workers on PAYE, Rishi was now turning his attention to the self-employed. We must forget ideology, he said as a warning shot to those Tory MPs who have an inbuilt aversion to anyone without the resources to look after themselves, and do the right thing. And the right thing to do was to offer all those with three years of accounts and earnings up to £50k per year a monthly payout of up to £2,500. With the option to extend if the coronavirus lockdown lasted longer than expected. There were a few hiccups in the system of course. As there were in the video-link with the media. “We turn next to Robert Peston of ITV,” said Rishi. “Oh shit,” said Peston. “Afternoon, Robert.” “Um ... My connection isn’t very stable, but I will give it a go.” The questions mainly centred on those who fell through the self-employed net. Those who might only just have turned self-employed or didn’t have more than a year or two of self-assessment accounts and didn’t have the cash flow to wait for the £7,500 payout in June would be able to get emergency handouts from universal credit (UC). Here Sunak’s age counted against him. He may be only 18 but he looks younger and clearly hasn’t yet discovered that universal credit hasn’t been a universal success. At the last count more than 500,000 people on PAYE had tried to access UC in the last 10 days. A further 3.5 million people logging in could break the system entirely. “You are currently number 3,289,688 in the queue. Your current estimated waiting time is seven years, nine months and 21 days. Please do hold as your call is important to us though we will do our best to time you out before you have spoken to the grandchild of the person who was originally answering the phone when you first rang.” The thing was, Rishi did this all with complete panache. He is a man untroubled by lack of self-confidence. He even managed to get away with threatening the self-employed with a massive hike in tax and national insurance contributions as a quid pro quo for his largesse, without offering them paid holiday or statutory sick pay in return. Because he was the King of Cool, the last of the big spenders who would see most people near enough alright. As he left the podium, he eyed up the Downing Street state rooms.

2020-03-26T19:31:57Z,politics,Politics,UK-EU talks on post-Brexit relations 'in deep freeze',"Planned negotiating rounds on the UK’s future relationship with the EU have been abandoned as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with Boris Johnson’s government still to table a comprehensive legal text for both sides to work on. During a European commission briefing on Thursday, envoys for the EU capitals were told that holding negotiations via video-conferencing had so far proved impossible. The two sides are trying to find a way to maintain dialogue in the coming weeks and months to kickstart the talks, but a previous schedule for negotiating rounds, with weeks set aside for consultation and preparation, has been ditched. The fact that the UK was still to table a legal text added an extra layer of difficulty, EU sources said.
The European commission published a 441-page draft treaty on 13 March that covers every aspect of the future relationship. The UK left the EU on 31 January and has until the end of the year to negotiate a new economic and security relationship or face trading on WTO terms with large tariffs on goods. Despite Downing Street’s public insistence that a similarly comprehensive text would be tabled earlier this month, EU sources said the UK had tabled only four documents covering trade, transport, aviation and nuclear cooperation. London has not tabled legal text on significant issues including security cooperation or fisheries, and nor has it made its texts public. EU sources also said the UK’s positions in the texts were in a “different galaxy” to those of Brussels. “The first big difference is that we have a fully fledged proposal in line with the political declaration while the Brits have only tabled a few things, much less than we expected”, one senior EU diplomat said. “The scope is much narrower than we had thought it would have been and that makes it difficult to work with. That’s the basic problem.” Officials on both sides are also struggling to find a way to get negotiations going, with plans for talks in London and Brussels now abandoned given the Covid-19 crisis. UK officials said the legal text covering the outstanding areas would be produced at a time of the British government’s choosing, and attempts to find a new method of “continuous dialogue” were being made. EU sources said the position was desperate. “We can’t even move out of Brussels to our capitals to talk it through,” said one source. “Everything is in the deep freeze.” The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is in quarantine having been infected with the coronavirus. The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, has been in isolation after showing symptoms.
The two sides need to agree on whether or not to extend the transition period by “up to one or two years” before 1 July. Johnson has insisted the UK will leave the EU’s single market and customs union by the end of the year come what may. The former Brexit secretary David Davis has suggested in recent days that the coronavirus pandemic would limit the damage of failing to secure a deal because trade would already have been reduced to a minimum. The main sticking points between the UK and the EU remain on so-called level playing field commitments to ensure that both sides retain high standards in the fields of environmental, social and labour regulations. Brussels is seeking non-regression from EU standards and for the UK to “harmonise” with Brussels on state aid rules that limit subsidies."
2020-03-26T18:51:43Z,politics,Politics,UK Covid-19 death toll reaches 578 after biggest recorded daily rise – as it happened,"Evening summary The UK experienced the largest daily increase in deaths from coronavirus. The total now stands at 578, up by 115 on the previous figure. The Department for Health and Social Care also confirmed that 11,658 people across the UK have tested positive for the virus. A new self-employed income support scheme will allow those with average profits of Â£50,000 or less to benefit from up to Â£2,500 in support a month. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the government would pay self-employed people a taxable grant based on their average monthly profits over the last three years, worth up to 80% of earnings. The scheme will come into effect in June, and cover a minimum of three months.
Downing Street announced a U-turn over the EU-wide ventilator procurement scheme. A spokesman for No 10 said the UK did not receive an invitation in time to join in the first effort to procure ventilators and other equipment â€œowing to an initial communication problemâ€�. UK aid spending on the fight against coronavirus has reached Â£544m, according to No 10. Much of the new funding, from its international aid budget, was announced today. It includes: Â£210m to the key international fund to find a coronavirus vaccine, Â£40m on developing affordable treatments including immunotherapies against the virus and Â£23m on developing easily manufactured test kits. The Crown Prosecution Service said people â€œcoronavirus coughingâ€� at emergency workers could be imprisoned for up to two years. The statement followed reports that police officers, shop workers and others had been coughed at by people claiming to have the disease. More sites across the country could be converted into makeshift coronavirus hospitals similar to the ExCel exhibition centre. During a Downing Street lobby briefing a government spokesperson did not rule out the report by Sky News that 10 sites had been identified. New police powers to enforce the coronavirus lockdown will allow officers to use force to make people go back home if they are in breach of the emergency laws. According to the Home Office, police can â€œinstructâ€� people to go home, leave an area or disperse, and may use â€œreasonable forceâ€� to return a person home in some circumstances. Boris Johnson is hoping to get 750,000 people to sign up for the NHS volunteer responders scheme, the prime ministerâ€™s spokesman has said. About 560,000 members of the public have already expressed their interest."
2020-03-26T18:25:08Z,politics,Politics,No 10 accused of putting 'Brexit over breathing' in Covid-19 ventilator row,"Downing Street has claimed it failed to take part in an EU scheme to source life-saving ventilators to treat coronavirus because it accidentally missed the deadline. No 10 initially said it did not take part because the UK was “no longer a member” and was “making our own efforts”. But after critics accused Boris Johnson of putting “Brexit over breathing”, a No 10 spokesman clarified that it had missed out because of an error and would consider participating in future. It is understood the UK claims not to have received an email from the EU asking it to participate. The mix-up means the UK has missed out on benefiting from the collective buying power of the EU. The bloc is seeking to use its clout to source large numbers of ventilators and protective equipment. A UK government spokesperson said: “Owing to an initial communication problem, the UK did not receive an invitation in time to join in four joint procurements in response to the coronavirus pandemic. “As the commission has confirmed, we are eligible to participate in joint procurements during the transition period, following our departure from the EU earlier this year.
“As those four initial procurement schemes had already gone out to tender, we were unable to take part in these, but we will consider participating in future procurement schemes on the basis of public health requirements at the time.” The UK has chosen to source ventilators from British manufacturers who have never made the products before. Dyson, the household appliance firm, said it had received an order for 10,000 machines. Asked why the UK was not taking part in the EU scheme, the prime minister’s official spokesman had earlier said: “We are no longer members of the EU.” He stressed that the UK was “making our own efforts” in this area.
When asked whether it would be hard for people to understand this decision, particularly in light of the fact Johnson has called for international cooperation in the fight against coronavirus, the spokesman said: “I’m not sure that it is.” Ministers have acknowledged the UK needs thousands more ventilators to prepare for the peak of the pandemic, adding to the 8,000 the NHS already has. No 10 said on Thursday that thousands of additional ventilators had been ordered but it could not put a timescale on their arrival. The spokesman said: “We would say we expect thousands of those to arrive in the coming weeks, and thousands more in the pipeline to arrive in the coming months.” The spokesman said Dyson would be paid for its ventilators only if they passed regulatory tests. He said there had been an “overwhelming response” from firms offering to make ventilators, and the government was now testing “proof of concept” with a number of suppliers. “New orders are all dependent on machines passing regulatory tests,” he said. However, opposition figures said the UK should join the EU procurement scheme as well, in case it could source equipment faster.
Layla Moran, a Liberal Democrat leadership candidate, said: “I would do whatever it takes to get more life-saving equipment, and they need to take the same approach. It’s a no-brainer we can help the NHS and save lives by working together with other countries.”
Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: “We raised this with ministers in the Commons earlier this week and did not receive a satisfactory response. With widespread concerns about our ventilator capacity and the urgent need to scale up that capacity, we should be cooperating through international schemes to ensure we get these desperately needed pieces of kit.”
Several small suppliers of ventilators have said the government has not responded to their offers to make more. The head of Direct Access, Steven Mifsud, told the Nantwich News he had sourced 5,000 ventilators and millions of face masks and personal protective equipment through partners in the United Arab Emirates. He said he registered the supply on the “ventilator challenge” page of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy website, but after five days he had heard nothing and the supplies went elsewhere. He was quoted as saying the only communication he had from the Department of Health was a “thank you” and “you are in our system”. “Time is a luxury that we as a nation do not have,” Mifsud said. “This virus does not wait for anyone and every second costs lives. I am incredibly frustrated with the British government and the current mañana attitude.” He said his partners in the UAE said they were getting responses from other countries within hours. Andrew Raynor, of the medical parts manufacturer MEC Medical, told the BBC’s Newsnight that nothing happened when he contacted the government offering to make ventilators. “The government should have given funding to existing ventilator manufacturers and existing companies like us,” he said."
2020-03-26T17:02:49Z,politics,Politics,MPs no longer to get automatic vote on constituency boundary plans,"MPs will no longer automatically get a vote on any future plans to redraw constituency boundaries. The government had planned to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 but announced a U-turn on Wednesday, the last day before parliamentary recess, citing the increased workload expected because of Brexit. However, it has also emerged that among the many changes planned by the government is that any future decisions from the Boundary Commission would be implemented automatically. The Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith said this would stop any “interference” in the process. A set of boundary plans were voted down by opposition MPs in 2013. There has been criticism in the past that MPs have vested interests in the boundaries of their constituency, as any redrawing of the map can place into their patch new council wards that might typically vote for other parties, making the constituency more or less safe for their own party. In her written statement to the Commons, Smith said: “This change would provide certainty that the recommendations of the independent boundary commissions – developed through a robust and impartial process that is open to extensive consultation – would then be implemented without interference.” The government has now changed the rules so that the new map would be implemented automatically by bringing it to parliament through a mechanism called an order in council. The latest boundary review process, the sixth one to take place since the 1940s, recommended in 2011 that the number of MPs should be reduced from 650 to 600, but the process has been beset with delays. Proposals laid out in 2013 that were backed by the Tories were defeated in parliament. The Boundary Commission released new proposals in 2018 recommending scrapping 32 seats in England, six in Scotland, 11 in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The boundaries would have scrapped Jeremy Corbyn’s Islington North seat and made Boris Johnson’s Uxbridge less safe by bringing in typically Labour-voting wards in Ealing. A controversial “Devonwall” seat that crossed the counties of Devon and Cornwall was another unpopular proposal in the now-axed 2018 plan. Smith said the decision to abandon plans to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 was sensible in light of changed circumstances. “Since that policy was established in the coalition agreement, the United Kingdom has now left the European Union,” she said. “The UK parliament will have a greater workload now we are taking back control and regaining our political and economic independence. It is therefore sensible for the number of parliamentary constituencies to remain at 650.”"
2020-03-26T06:00:19Z,politics,Politics,Gordon Brown calls for global government to tackle coronavirus,"Gordon Brown has urged world leaders to create a temporary form of global government to tackle the twin medical and economic crises caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The former Labour prime minister, who was at the centre of the international efforts to tackle the impact of the near-meltdown of the banks in 2008, said there was a need for a taskforce involving world leaders, health experts and the heads of the international organisations that would have executive powers to coordinate the response. A virtual meeting of the G20 group of developed and developing countries, chaired by Saudi Arabia, will be held on Thursday, but Brown said it would have been preferable to have also included the UN security council.
“This is not something that can be dealt with in one country,” he said. “There has to be a coordinated global response.” Brown said the current crisis was different to the one he was involved in. “That was an economic problem that had economic causes and had an economic solution. “This is first and foremost a medical emergency and there has to be joint action to deal with that. But the more you intervene to deal with the medical emergency, the more you put economies at risk.” During the financial crisis, Brown persuaded other global leaders of the need to bail out the banks and then hosted a meeting of the G20 in London, which came up with a $1.1tn rescue package. Despite Donald Trump’s “America first” policy, he said it was still possible to get support for an emergency body with executive powers.
Brown said his proposed global taskforce would fight the crisis on two fronts. There would need to be a coordinated effort to find a vaccine, and to organise production, purchasing and prevent profiteering. Many countries have announced economic packages in the past two weeks but Brown said a taskforce could: make sure the efforts of central banks were coordinated; take steps to prevent the record flight of capital from emerging market economies; and agree a joint approach to the use of government spending to boost growth. Brown said there had been resistance in 2008 to using the G20 as a vehicle for tackling the financial crisis, but that it should be clear to world leaders that there was no possibility of a go-it-alone approach working.
“We need some sort of working executive,” Brown said. “If I were doing it again, I would make the G20 a broader organisation because in the current circumstances you need to listen to the countries that are most affected, the countries that are making a difference and countries where there is the potential for a massive number of people to be affected - such as those in Africa.” The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund needed an increase in their financial firepower to cope with the impact of the crisis on low- and middle-income countries, he said."
2020-03-25T19:07:48Z,politics,Politics,"Boris Johnson and his donkeys stumble on, led by lions they try to lead","We were still a long way short of John Bercow’s last prime minister’s questions hurrah. That clocked in at a mind-numbing 70 minutes. But with parliament due to go into early recess that evening and with no guarantee of a date for its return, Speaker Lindsay Hoyle chose to effectively run two separate half-hour PMQs consecutively. In theory it was a good idea, as MPs are going to have almost no opportunities to hold Boris Johnson and the government to account during a national emergency. In practice, it rather fell flat. The only questions on anyone’s mind right now are on the coronavirus, but Boris has precious little by way of any answers. Just the usual evasions followed by his new slogan. ‘‘Stay at home. Protect the NHS. Help save lives.’’ That’s the closest the government has to a policy right now. PMQs could have gone on for another couple of hours and no one would have been any the wiser. This was Jeremy Corbyn’s last PMQs and it initially felt as if he was determined to fade himself out with a faint whimper. His voice was croaky – he didn’t sound well – and though his questions were all perfectly reasonable, he was struggling to inject them with any passion or feeling. And not even his special advisers got to see him shine. They were all thrown out of the press gallery for taking photos on their phones. Perhaps they thought they had seen it all before anyway. But as he got into his second set of six questions, some of the intensity returned. He made a point of praising not just the frontline NHS staff who were struggling to fight the pandemic with limited resources, but also the cleaners who made so many hospitals and workplaces safe. He also raised key issues about help for the self-employed, the level of testing, construction sites forcing workers to come in and a universal credit system that wasn’t fit for purpose even when it didn’t have an extra 500,000 people trying to log in over the past 10 days. Boris did his best to sound statesmanlike and gracious – even he can see this isn’t a time for petty point-scoring – but he never sounded wholly convincing. This isn’t what he signed up for when he became prime minister, and faking it to make it is a lot harder than it sounds. Telling the country it will need to make sacrifices is not that convincing when the only sacrifices Boris has ever made have been of other people on the altar of his own career. What answers Boris did give were worse than useless. He couldn’t explain why testing levels were still way down on what he had promised the week before: all he could offer was the promise of millions of tests soon. When exactly, he didn’t know.
He pifflepafflewifflewaffled about the self-employed. Some were very rich, so it would be wrong to help the starving before the system had been properly finessed. It was all very difficult, he said, but an announcement would be coming soon. He was also keen that only those who had to go to work should go to work, though obviously it was up to bosses to decide who needed to go to work. Can’t afford to alienate any possible donors to the Tory party, after all. Peak nonsense was reached with several Conservative MPs congratulating Boris for the clarity of his messaging. Just about the only clarity the government has has shown so far has been in its obvious willingness to delay. We live in mañana times. The government had two months to learn from the spread of the coronavirus in China, but chose to celebrate Brexit day, fail to deal with the floods and take 10 days off over half-term instead. Any of the decisions it now says it is working night and day on could have been taken weeks ago. Boris’s offer to wrap an arm of comfort around every worker sounded increasingly hollow. Nor was there much comfort to be had from the daily Downing Street press conference later in the day. Both chief medical officer Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance poured cold water on the promise Boris had made at PMQs that millions of antibody tests could be available as early as next week. Whitty even said it was going to be a close run thing whether the NHS would be able to cope. Boris just looked done in. Like a children’s entertainer who had long since used up every failsafe gag and trick, long since lost his audience. His eyes are now barely detectable red dwarf pinpricks, hidden by bags collapsing in on themselves as his face melts into the despair of premature old age. All the questions focused on matters of trust. On tests, prioritising the economy before lives and acting soon enough. Any country wants to believe in its leader, but it’s clear that now many people have lost faith in Boris’s judgment calls. Even Whitty and Vallance appeared to have their doubts about him, qualifying their support to the limits of their brief and staying well clear of the politics. At critical times, Boris has been found wanting. The wrong person for such a critical time. The only moment of inspiration was the news that 405,000 people had registered as NHS volunteers in the past 24 hours. The UK will get through this, but when it does, it will have been the people, not the government, who should take the credit. The lions leading the donkeys."
2020-03-25T19:02:06Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus home tests: what they are and how they work,"What is the coronavirus home test? It is a finger-prick antibody test that will tell you whether you have been infected with the Sars-CoV2 virus which causes Covid-19. It detects the presence of antibodies in your blood that show your immune system has responded to the coronavirus. It cannot tell you if you currently have the virus; it is for people who have had symptoms and recovered, so that they will know they are no longer infectious and can return to work. People are usually immune to the virus once they have had it. There are case reports of some reinfections, but they are rare.
How does it work? It looks like a pregnancy test, but includes a small sterile lance to draw a drop of blood from your finger. That is mixed with fluid in the test kit and analysed for the presence of the antibodies. It takes only 10 to 15 minutes. There are a few commercial tests in development. Public Health England has not said which ones are expected to be made available in the UK. Some can be self-read but others will need the help of a healthcare professional. The tests are currently being evaluated in Oxford to ensure they work. Once they are available to the public – the government says key workers will come first – they will be delivered by Amazon and also be available in high-street chemist shops. If there is a cost, it is expected to be minimal.
Is this the test in use at the moment? No. That’s the standard PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test which is being used in hospitals to find out whether patients who are severely ill have Covid-19, so they can be treated appropriately. It tests for current infection and cannot tell you if you have had Covid-19 in the past. The government has said it wants to increase the numbers tested to 25,000 a day, but the last daily figure was just under 6,500. However, the pharmaceutical giant Roche has signed a deal to help, a testing centre has been opened in Milton Keynes, and the number of tests is supposed to rise to 10,000 within days and then 25,000. These will be mostly hospital patients as now, with further upscaling to 100,000 to reach key workers with symptoms. What other tests are needed? A seroprevalence test. This is a blood test carried out in a systematic way to understand the extent of the epidemic in the UK – the scale and the characteristics of people who have become ill and recovered."
2020-03-25T18:56:57Z,politics,Politics,The Guardian view on parliament in a crisis: rising to the challenge | Editorial,"Prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons typifies British democracy in some respects. It fulfils an essential function by means of convention, and it often promotes theatrical performance over legal substance. Executive power wielded from Downing Street is wide-ranging and, if the incumbent commands a large parliamentary majority, hard to check in practice. But prime ministers cannot hide from interrogation by MPs. Their strengths are proven and their weaknesses exposed. Boris Johnson has not feared Jeremy Corbyn in that arena and will not face the outgoing Labour leader again after Wednesday’s session. The valedictory exchanges were true to type for each man. Mr Corbyn raised important issues regarding the coronavirus response, but without forensic rigour. Mr Johnson gave responses too void of information to qualify as answers. The weekly routine of hurling barbs across the despatch box is not often edifying. David Cameron once pledged to end “Punch and Judy politics”, but failed to stop the pantomime element. Mr Corbyn has tried to change the tone, introducing questions sent to his office from members of the public – an innovation that was mocked in Westminster, although it did expose some of the vacuity of the usual proceedings. But the Labour leader’s unfocused method has given successive prime ministers an easy ride. Tory whips have eased their leaders’ burden by planting soft questions with sycophantic MPs who, for example, invite the prime minister to join them in celebrating the government’s achievements. Another unwelcome habit is the tendency to deliver micro-speeches for use later as self-promoting digital clips. The Commons was overly theatrical before MPs started using it as a stage scenery for their Facebook campaigns. Parliament is also host to erudite speeches and great acts of persuasion. Much of that goes unnoticed because PMQs has the higher profile and showcases the worst, not the best. A civil, respectful debate on the coronavirus bill earlier this week was a better spectacle because it was unspectacular. MPs were thoughtful and measured in grappling with the dilemma of how to restrict public activity without suffocating civil society. Partisan hostilities were suspended. Government by perpetual consensus is not possible. Robust debate in an oppositional system can protect against excess cosiness in the political class, but a crisis such as the one currently unfolding also illuminates the ground where politics must transcend normal political battle lines. The adversarial style is not always fitted to times of national adversity, and at those moments the Commons is capable of encompassing disagreement over policy within an understanding of common political enterprise. Parliament breaks for recess at the end of this week and it is not yet clear how the legislature’s function in holding the government to account can be performed in a state of lockdown. That is a cause for concern, but there is reassurance in the disciplined and serious response of MPs to the crisis so far. The old institutions are imperfect but robust, anachronistic at times but creative in extremis. It is easy to find examples in recent years of Westminster politics at its worst, but rising to the present challenge can also be a moment when British democracy performs at its best."
2020-03-25T18:41:41Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: tests prioritised for NHS workers, 'not available on the internet next week' – as it happened","Mass home testing is to be made available â€˜within daysâ€™, Public Health England has claimed. The test, which involves pricking the finger to produce a drop of blood, which is then analysed by the device, will first be validated in Oxford to ensure it works as well as scientists hope. That will happen this week and it should then be available to test healthcare workers and also the general public. But at the PMâ€™s press conference this afternoon Prof Chris Whitty, the governmentâ€™s chief medical adviser, played down the idea that millions of the tests would be available on the internet next week. (See 6.18pm.) Prince Charles tested positive for coronavirus, displaying mild symptoms â€œbut otherwise remains in good healthâ€�. He and the Duchess of Cornwall, who tested negative, are self-isolating on the Balmoral Estate. The government is considering introducing wartime-style legislation to outlaw coronavirus profiteering. The competition watchdog has already set up a taskforce to investigate coronavirus profiteering. Anyone with concerns about a business engaged in profiteering or harmful pricing practices should report it to the CMA. Some 405,000 people have signed up to volunteer for the NHS to help tackle the coronavirus. This includes more than 170,000 who signed up overnight, less than 15 hours after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, called for a quarter of a million volunteers to support the NHS fightback. The coronavirus strain on the NHS is likely to peak in three weeksâ€™ time, the Commons science committee heard. Prof Neil Ferguson said he was confident the NHS would be able to cope with the epidemic. The Sports Direct owner, Mike Ashley, and JD Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin have been asked to explain to MPs by the end of this week what they are doing to protect their staff. Both firms have faced criticism this week for their response to the lockdown. Sports Direct angered staff by telling them they would have to turn up to work even though its stores were closed, and Martin upset some of his workers by telling them they should consider getting a job with a supermarket instead. Almost half a million people applied for universal credit in the last nine days, the Commons work and pensions committee heard. The work and pensions secretary, ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey, told the committee that extra money had been directed to an online verification programme, while staff would also be making outbound calls to verify peopleâ€™s claims. The coronavirus bill, which gives the government a series of extensive emergency powers it may need to deal with the coronavirus epidemic, was granted royal assent, after it was passed with cross-party support. Parliament will close early for Easter recess, one week earlier than expected, and recess could be extended. For more coronavirus updates, do read our global coronavirus live blog."
2020-03-25T18:40:18Z,politics,Politics,British diplomat dies of coronavirus in Hungary,"Britain’s deputy ambassador to Hungary, Steven Dick, has died in Budapest after contracting coronavirus. Dick, 37, died on Tuesday, according to a Foreign Office statement on Wednesday afternoon. “Steven was a dedicated diplomat and represented his country with great skill and passion. He will be missed by all those who knew him and worked with him,” said the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab. Dick joined the FCO in 2008 and had previously been posted to Kabul and Riyadh. He took up his posting in Budapest last autumn after undergoing a year of full-time intensive Hungarian language training. He was well-liked on the diplomatic circuit in the city and was friendly, sociable and enthusiastic about his work. He had recently returned to Budapest from a holiday in Mexico, and early last week he said in a WhatsApp message that he had contracted coronavirus and was in isolation, but was feeling fine except for being bored. Local sources said he had been treated at a hospital in Budapest in recent days. It appears his condition deteriorated rapidly. It was not immediately clear whether he had suffered from any underlying health conditions. His parents, Steven and Carol Dick, paid tribute. “Steven was a much-loved son, grandson and nephew. He was kind, funny and generous. It was always his dream to work for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and he was very happy representing our country overseas. We are devastated by his loss and ask for privacy at this tragic time,” they said in a statement circulated by the FCO. Sir Simon McDonald, the permanent under-secretary at the FCO, said: “I knew Steven personally and he was an exemplary officer and a lovely man. He was just starting out on what was sure to be an outstanding career and his friends around the world and across the FCO will miss him sorely. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.”
Hungary has reported just 226 confirmed cases of coronavirus, though the country has carried out only 6,800 tests, leading to fears that the real figure could be much higher. Dick was the 10th death in the country. At the British embassy in Budapest, colleagues expressed shock and sadness at the news. “We extend our deepest condolences and sympathy to his family and friends,” said the British ambassador to Hungary, Iain Lindsay. “Steven was a dear colleague and friend who had made a tremendous impression in Hungary since his arrival last October with his personal warmth and his sheer professionalism, not least his excellent Hungarian.”"
2020-03-25T13:54:19Z,politics,Politics,Corbyn uses final PMQs to press Johnson on coronavirus response,"Jeremy Corbyn has used the last prime minister’s questions before he steps down as Labour leader to pressure Boris Johnson over the government’s response to coronavirus, and to argue the crisis shows the need for a society. After quizzing Johnson over issues including testing and protective equipment for frontline staff, and help for tenants and the self-employed, Corbyn used his final question to call for lessons to be learned from the pandemic. “This crisis shows us how deeply we depend on each other,” he told a special PMQs session split into two halves, so MPs would not be too closely crammed into the chamber. “We’ll only come through this as a society through a huge collective effort. At a time of crisis, no one is an island, no one is self-made. “The wellbeing of the wealthiest corporate chief executive officer depends on the outsourced worker cleaning their office. At times like this we have to recognise the value of each other, and the strength of a society that cares for each other, and care for all.”
The prime minister responded by saying: “There he and I completely agree. We will get this country through this crisis with these exceptional steps.” In a sometimes critical but generally even-tempered session, Johnson used his first answer to pay tribute to Corbyn, saying: “We may not agree about everything, but no one can doubt his sincerity and his desire to build a better society.” Corbyn thanked the PM, but stressed he was not about to retire from frontline politics: “He was talking as though this was a sort of obituary. Just to let him know – my voice will not be stilled, I’ll be around, I’ll be campaigning, I’ll be arguing, and I’ll be demanding justice for the people of this country and, indeed, the rest of the world.” Johnson said testing for coronavirus was “massively increasing” to 25,000 a day, and had been a priority since the crisis began. But Corbyn pressed him on access to tests for both NHS and care staff, and asked about care workers being unable to buy enough food for residents. He also raised the “appalling situation” of a lack of personal protective equipment for NHS and care workers.
The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt joined the calls for routine testing in the community, referencing programmes in South Korea and Germany, and also asked for weekly tests for NHS workers. Johnson said testing for NHS staff would be done as soon as possible. MPs shared stories from their constituencies about the impact of coronavirus and a lack of safety equipment. Peter Kyle, the Labour MP for Hove, told the PM about Oaklands nursing home, where a 94-year-old resident developed coronavirus symptoms. A test was only carried out 10 days later, by which point 14 of the 20 residents had symptoms and seven staff were off sick, self-isolating. They had all been working in other care homes as they were agency staff. “None of the protective equipment requested had arrived,” Kyle said.
Johnson said he realised protective equipment was a real concern, saying that in the last 24 hours, 7.5m sets of equipment had been distributed. In his questions, Corbyn also pressed on the rights of private renters, asking why a promised complete ban on evictions under the emergency coronavirus bill had instead just extended the notice required for possession, from two months to three. Johnson declined to give assurances that a complete ban would be enforced, but said renters were safe. Corbyn replied: “Unfortunately this isn’t what the reality is on the ground, as many of my colleagues will point out. We are getting constituents in touch with us who are being threatened with eviction now because they are in rent arrears, because they cannot work, because of the shutdown over coronavirus.”"
2020-03-25T09:11:09Z,politics,Politics,UK parliament to close early for Easter amid coronavirus fears,"Parliament is to close for Easter a week early amid fears that coronavirus has been spreading fast through Westminster. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, laid a motion saying parliament will adjourn on Wednesday night until 21 April, but that the date would be reviewed closer to the time and there are a number of suggestions it may return for only two days a week with limited numbers. MPs have called for ministers to take part in daily video conferencing so they can keep scrutinising the government’s handling of the Covid-19 outbreak while parliament is in recess. The Labour backbencher Wes Streeting said: “The idea we are sending parliament away during a national crisis, rather than scrutinising the government effectively, will lead to concerns from the public. “At a time when we are asking key workers to, and the public sector and private sector to go to work, I think that parliamentary scrutiny is an essential function when we are being inundated with constituents who are self-employed, people on statutory sick pay struggling to make ends meet or stuck abroad.” The former minister Chris Bryant MP said: “MPs should be allowed to ask questions like journalists are. If Rishi Sunak is making a statement on support for the self-employed you should allow MPs to ask questions as well. There is no reason why this couldn’t be set up with video conferencing.” Under questioning from MPs on the last day before recess, Rees-Mogg said he was liaising on the creation of hotlines for MPs into ministries so they could seek urgent response to coronavirus-related issues during the break. Both Streeting and Bryant also suggested now could be the time to implement electronic voting, a move that the European parliament made on Monday. Although few votes are expected, Streeting said: “This is not necessarily a permanent way of running our democracy but extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.” Parliamentary authorities are considering opening for two days a week after the Easter break, likely to be a Tuesday or Wednesday, with a representative proportion of the political makeup of the Commons. Bryant suggested using Westminster Hall on the parliamentary estate to house the Commons after Easter. As one of the largest medieval halls in Europe, it could easily host 650 MPs with distance between people, he suggested. A Whitehall source said a range of plans were being considered, adding: “The plans have to be flexible because if we’re in a Italy situation in a few weeks’ time we will need a different plan to if we’re in a South Korea situation.” The Liberal Democrats chief whip, Alistair Carmichael, said he was having talks with his government counterpart over ways to allow parliamentary scrutiny of government after the Easter recess without all MPs having to be in Westminster. Carmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, said his revamped, physically distanced trip back to his constituency – a sleeper train to Edinburgh, a hire car to Aberdeen then a solo cabin on the ferry to Orkney – took 26 hours each way. “This is fine to get me home at the start of a recess, but if this were to be the regular pattern, I can’t spend 52 hours a week doing this, every week. We need to find a more creative and inventive way of doing it,” he said. With a vote needed on a finance bill next month, Carmichael said, one option could be to only call back a proportional sample of MPs from each party, totalling 100 or fewer. A way to ensure scrutiny could be to hold events via video link, and to create a cross-party select committee, as New Zealand has just done, where the new body is chaired by the country’s leader of the opposition, Simon Bridges. Talks so far with the government chief whip, Mark Spencer, had focused on pairing MPs to mean not all had to come into Westminster, Carmichael said: “Whether they are prepared to go as far as the New Zealand example, I think they will need some persuasion, but after four or five weeks with no parliamentary scrutiny, I think there will be a head of steam in the country for parliament to do more than just nod stuff through.” Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, was challenged on whether the adjournment would prevent proper scrutiny of the government’s coronavirus response, after speculation that parliament could end up being shuttered for months.
Jenrick insisted parliament would return after Easter as usual, potentially with some changes such as committee meetings held remotely. “It will return in the usual way so MPs can continue to hold the government to account. We live in a democracy so it is absolutely essential the government is held to account particularly in times like this. Parliament will return,” he said. “There has been another order in parliament to create ways for select committees to operate remotely. Innovation will happen to make it possible for MPs to hold us to account and that is absolutely right.” At least 20 MPs are confirmed or suspected to have had coronavirus, and No 10 officials, members of parliamentary staff and political journalists are also among those who are isolating. The first confirmed case among MPs was Nadine Dorries, who has since returned to work as a health minister. Parliament has continued sitting with some changes to voting to ensure that MPs are not crowding into lobbies together but keeping their distance. It broke tonight for Easter one week earlier than scheduled."
2020-03-24T20:31:47Z,politics,Politics,Matt Hancock looks bewildered that the NHS isn't in better shape | John Crace,"Just under two years ago, Matt Hancock dreamed up the idea of appearing as a hologram for his speech as culture secretary at the Conservative party conference. Today his wish more or less came true, as he fronted the first ever virtual Downing Street press conference with questions from journalists being broadcast in remotely. By the end, Hancock must have wished he hadn’t bothered, as it turned into yet another communications farce. Carry on up the Corona. Left hand, meet right hand. He might as well have left the presser to Boris Johnson. The prime minister seems to be able to contradict himself at will from one day to the next and the only fallout seems to be that his approval ratings jump by 20%. Go figure. Give Boris another five days of major cock-ups and he will have 140% of the country fully behind him. To be fair, Hancock started well enough. This wasn’t the boyish Tigger, full of mindless optimism and enthusiasm for any mere trifle: it was the more serious, grown-up, shaving-twice-a-week Hancock. The health secretary who, unlike the prime minister, doesn’t have to make an effort to look like he gives a toss. Matt leaves no one in any doubt that each death matters to him: even if he does still occasionally look a little bewildered that, after 10 years of heavy-duty cuts by successive Tory governments, the NHS isn’t in better shape to cope with the coronavirus crisis. He is the man you can endearingly rely on to strain every cliche to prove his commitment. There were no histrionics or excessive hand-clasping – “What will these hands ne’er be clean?” – on Boris’s statement the night before. Instead he stuck to some basic facts. The number of deaths overnight. The introduction of a Mum’s and Dad’s Army. The recruitment of 250,000 volunteers. A new temporary 4,000-bed hospital in London’s East End. More antibody testing. So far, so good. It all rather fell apart, though, once the questions started. The previous day, Boris had insisted that everyone should remain at home unless they absolutely needed to go to work. Now it seemed that the message had changed. If your boss really wanted you to work on a construction site, then it was perfectly reasonable for you to squeeze on to an overcrowded tube or bus – which were already running reduced services due to staff self-isolating – because once you had got to work, you’d be free to breathe fresh air two metres away from the bloke standing right next to you. At this point, Matt started to look a little twitchy. He is a man of some conscience and insight and his body has its own inbuilt bullshit detector when he’s forced to parrot a party line he knows to be contradictory. Neither Boris nor Michael Gove would have broken sweat at talking such bollocks. In desperation, Matt looked to Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, to bail him out. She didn’t look thrilled at the hospital pass, but took the hit anyway. She was certain construction bosses couldn’t possibly be putting profit before public health and all had nothing but their workers’ best interests at heart. There were plenty of great bosses leading by example. Mike Ashley, Tim Martin … Harries also unexpectedly found herself in the role of agony aunt as she was asked for guidance on how couples who were not cohabiting should behave. “Oooh,” she said, playing for time. Perhaps couples could try just seeing each other now and again and practise a little self-restraint. Or if they really couldn’t keep their hands off one another for the next few months, then maybe they should try moving in together. It didn’t exactly sound like official Public Health England guidelines. But who knows? I can’t help feeling that therapists and divorce lawyers are going to be coining it in once the pandemic lockdown is all over.
The one person playing an absolute blinder throughout the press conference was Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England. Principally by virtue of barely saying a word. His only contribution was to make some non-committal remarks about the testing of various drugs and the need to learn more about their efficacy. Having said that, he went back to staring at his shoes. Less is more. Many politicians could learn a lot from him. Towards the end, Hancock found himself in difficulties once more. First by failing to explain why it had taken two months for the UK to finally get round to buying 3.5m testing kits, and then by saying there had been 7m movements of protective clothing. It wasn’t clear if this was the same item of clothing being moved 7m times or 1m items being moved seven times. Matt also totally dodged the question of whether the UK’s delay in implementing the same lockdown measures as other European countries – hell, we hadn’t gone to all the trouble of leaving the EU only to carry on following its petty, bureaucratic regulations – had caused more deaths. Nor did he explain why we weren’t joining the joint EU initiative to make more ventilators. Only proper UK oxygen for us. Instead, the health secretary chivalrously left it to Harries to mutter something about science not always being exact. Over the past few weeks, it feels as if Boris’s version of UK science has been less exact than most. Time will tell. Harries made a throat-slit gesture and Hancock abruptly called proceedings to a halt. At least he wouldn’t have to do that again for another week. And when he did, he’d make damn sure it was his hologram taking the flak."
2020-03-24T18:16:45Z,politics,Politics,Alex Salmond allies say he plans to sue Scottish government,"Alex Salmond is expected to sue the Scottish government over the alleged role of its senior officials in his prosecution for sexual assaults, his allies have disclosed. Sources close to the former first minister said he believed senior figures inside the government and Nicola Sturgeon’s office helped orchestrate significant parts of the case against him, and that he intends to sue for extensive damages. Salmond is said to be particularly furious that details of an internal Scottish government inquiry into sexual assault allegations were leaked to the Daily Record in August 2018, and to believe a government official is to blame.
Salmond was acquitted on Monday of all 14 assault charges, including one of attempted rape and another of intent to rape, by majority verdicts, following an 11-day trial at the high court in Edinburgh. He was formally acquitted of one sexual assault charge midway through the trial after it was withdrawn by the prosecution. The jury later found him not guilty of 12 of the charges and said one was not proven, a verdict that also acquits the accused. “It’s pretty clear he intends to sue the Scottish government for damages,” said one ally. “He believes this came from the top.” His allies also believe prominent officials in Sturgeon’s office and the Scottish National party should be fired after text messages and emails came to light that Salmond argues raises serious questions about their role in the case, and their handling of allegations against him.
One close friend of Salmond’s said the former SNP leader is also very keen to give evidence to a Holyrood investigation into a botched Scottish government internal inquiry into complaints of misconduct brought against him by two civil servants in 2018. The special committee of inquiry at Holyrood was set up after Leslie Evans, the Scottish government’s permanent secretary, admitted in January 2019 the internal investigation had the appearance of bias because the official in charge of it had prior contact with the complainants. The alleged assaults against the two civil servants were investigated by Police Scotland detectives and included in the charges levelled against Salmond during his trial. He was acquitted by the jury of both those sexual assaults on Monday. Salmond won his judicial review in January 2019 and in August 2019, the Scottish government paid out £512,000 to cover the legal fees he had incurred. The specially convened Holyrood committee, with includes three former SNP ministers, is due to start hearing witnesses later this year after the coronavirus outbreak has subsided. The Scottish parliament’s sessions have been significantly curtailed by the crisis. In the interim, the committee has asked to be given copies of non-confidential evidence used during the trial so MSPs can study the background papers during the lockdown period and spring recess next month. Before the trial, Salmond’s lawyer, Gordon Jackson QC, presented in closed court details of text messages between senior figures in the Scottish government and SNP, which Salmond argues proves there was orchestration. Joanna Cherry QC, an SNP MP who is one of Salmond’s closest allies, said on Monday: “Some of the evidence which has come to light raises very serious questions over the process that was employed within the Scottish government to investigate the alleged complaints.” Sturgeon told reporters on Monday she was ready to give evidence after the coronavirus crisis was over. “The court has given a verdict, a decision, and that must be respected,” she said. “I have no doubt there will be further discussion around this issue in due course, and I will welcome that, but that time is not now. This country faces a crisis right now, bigger than we’ve ever faced before.” A close ally of Sturgeon’s dismissed claims by Salmond’s supporters that the first minister would be forced to resign due to the controversy. He said there were few MPs or MSPs who believed that was justified. “There are going to be difficulties ahead as we navigate through this,” he said. “Is this going to bring the first minister down? No, it’s not. I don’t see that they’ve got a mechanism to do that. It’s not great, but we will get through this.”"
2020-03-24T18:06:09Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus: 12,000 former NHS workers to return and emergency hospital to open as death toll rises – as it happened","The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, did not rule out lockdown rules getting even tighter after three weeks. He told Sky News this morning: â€œIn three weeksâ€™ time we will be able to say whether or not the path that weâ€™ve followed needs any further intensification, or whether there are one or two of the existing restrictions that may be capable of being lifted.â€� Ministers came under pressure to clarify what guidelines mean following some confusion over guidance including as to whether major construction work should go ahead and whether construction workers are considered essential workers and should continue to go to work on building sites. The government continued to face pressure over the lack of routine testing for Covid-19, the plight of Britons stranded abroad and delays to urgent help for the self-employed. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the delay in announcing help for the self-employed was down to it being â€œincredibly complicatedâ€� finding a way of designing a scheme that would help those in need, while not giving money to people who did not need it. The death toll in the UK rose by 87 to 422 â€“ the largest day-on-day increase in the number of deaths since the outbreak began. Broken down: a further 83 people died in England, bringing the total to 386; a further two people died in Scotland, bringing the total to 16; a further patient died in Wales, bringing the total to 17; and a fourth patient died in Northern Ireland. The figure for England includes the first patient to die after contracting coronavirus in hospital. The UK is heading for deep recession as the economy is contracting at its fastest rate in at least two decades, as the service sector is hit extremely hard by the Covid-19 outbreak. Almost 12,000 recently retired NHS staff had responded to the call to return to the service. They included 2,660 doctors, more than 2,500 pharmacists and other staff and 6,147 nurses, he said. And some 5,500 final-year medics and 18,700 final-year student nurses will â€œmove to the frontlineâ€� next week. A temporary 4,000-bed hospital â€“ the â€œNHS Nightingale Hospitalâ€� â€“ will be opening at Londonâ€™s ExCel centre next week. People face fines starting at Â£30 for breaking the rule about holding gatherings in public. Supermarkets introduced tougher measures to police in-store physical distancing between shoppers.

2020-03-24T13:49:36Z,politics,Politics,Labour's long leadership battle 'hampering coronavirus response',"Labour’s four-month leadership election to replace Jeremy Corbyn has hampered the party’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, according to some of its MPs. Critics said the party’s leadership has been sluggish in responding to the crisis and Corbyn, as outgoing leader, has failed to command authority. They said that it had instead fallen to backbenchers and shadow ministers to put pressure on the government, and called for the leadership race to be wrapped up early. Lucy Powell MP, who is leading an inquiry into Labour’s general election loss, said she sympathised with Corbyn, who was facing an unprecedented international crisis as leader of the opposition, but that he could have ended the contest sooner. Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy have been battling for more than 11 weeks to succeed him. Voting is due to end on 2 April. She said: “We could have easily brought forward the election of the new leader. We are now in the worst of all worlds. Despite their best efforts, Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell feel less relevant.” The Manchester Central MP said the party needed “that sense of clarity on leadership rather than different messages coming out from different quarters”. She urged the party to act, saying it was not too late to bring forward the election date so the next leader could take over and start attending key government meetings on coronavirus, such as the privy council. Chris Matheson MP, a shadow cabinet minister backing Starmer, said: “The lesson for the future is seriously that such a protracted contest does nobody any good.” Labour’s national executive committee (NEC) fixed the timetable for the leadership election in January amid criticism that it was deliberately long to help Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, a close ally of Corbyn. The party has said it is reluctant to bring forward the election as it would risk disenfranchising members and supporters who haven’t yet voted. One backbencher said Corbyn should have immediately stepped down and an acting leader would have galvanised key players from the parliamentary Labour party on coronavirus, rather than seeing a piecemeal approach, which has included amendments to the emergency legislation from MPs Harriet Harman and Chris Bryant and shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth, who personally pushed for enforced physical distancing. They said: “Fundamentally, it goes back to the fact that Jeremy stayed in post after the general election, which led to a ridiculously long leadership election. A sensible acting leader would never have allowed the NEC to allow it to go on for so long. We would have had a leader standing at the dispatch box with real credibility.” The MP suggested Labour could have had more influence by creating a shadow Cobra, the government’s emergency committee. “Or you could have credibly asked the government to set up a cross-party taskforce using Labour’s expertise on DWP issues.” A Labour party spokesperson said: “Jeremy and the shadow cabinet have led a strong and effective response to the coronavirus crisis, offering constructive support to the government where possible and pushing it whenever necessary on key issues such as protection and testing for NHS staff, help for renters, income protection for workers, the self employed and those on insecure contracts, increasing statutory sick pay, and most recently calling for enforcing social protection measures. “In a number of key areas, the government has followed Labour’s demands for action.” Labour said that Corbyn wrote to the Boris Johnson on 14 March calling for mortgage and rent holidays, both of which the government has since adopted, and an expansion of statutory sick pay. A shadow frontbencher also criticised the core Labour leadership for taking too long to decide whether to support a lockdown. “Jeremy has been really cautious,” they said. “People are looking for politicians for leadership. They’re not seeing it in government and it’s lacking on our side as well. “The Labour leadership is just as guilty as Boris Johnson for not taking it seriously as they should. It feels like Jeremy and John were both completely absent until last week.” It is understood that Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general and former director of civil liberties organisation Liberty, surprised fellow shadow cabinet members when she stepped in to encourage the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, that proportionate legislation could work, if it included a sunset clause. Corbyn’s decision to continue attending the Commons, and carrying out an interview on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, despite the government guidance that people over 70, regardless of any medical conditions, should consider physical distancing has also angered colleagues. “That was just wrong. He should lead by example,” said the frontbencher. But a Labour source said: “Using a time of national crisis to get in a last dig at Jeremy is divisive, silly and about as low as you can go. They should be ashamed of themselves.”"
2020-03-24T13:22:17Z,politics,Politics,UK lockdown: Gove tries to clarify confusion over coronavirus rules,"Ministers have attempted to clarify the rules around Boris Johnson’s lockdown, amid confusion over who is allowed to travel to work, whether children can visit separated parents and what counts as exercise. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, gave more guidance on Tuesday morning on the unprecedented restrictions announced by the prime minister, which will be enforced by police. Under the rules, people must stay at home unless they have to leave the house to work, to get essential supplies of food or medicine, to help the vulnerable or for one period of exercise a day.
The biggest confusion was over whether workers should count their jobs as essential, with construction workers, taxi drivers and tradespeople unsure. Some retail workers, such as staff at Sports Direct, were still called into their jobs by employers despite the order for non-essential retail to close. Sports Direct later changed its mind and said it was closing its stores.
Gove said construction workers should still be going to work while staying two metres apart and tradespeople, such as plumbers and electricians, could attend emergencies in people’s homes. He said it was “unhelpful” and “wrong” for stores such as Sports Direct to remain open to sell sports and leisure wear, arguing that people generally had the appropriate clothing to go for a run or walk already. Non-essential shopping deliveries – such as clothes and toys – would be allowed to continue.
Gove issued a series of stark warnings about the consequences of flouting the ban. Shown pictures on Sky News of construction workers gathering close together, he said: “Unless you stay at home, then the people you love most may die.” He said help for self-employed people would be outlined “later” by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, because many of them were still packing on to public transport on Tuesday in the absence of financial support to compensate them for loss of their work.
There was also confusion over the movement of children of divorced and separated parents, after contact between households was banned. Gove initially suggested contact would not be allowed but he later corrected himself, saying children under 18 would be permitted to move between the households of their separated parents. On different types of exercise, he said people would be allowed to run, walk or go to an allotment, but not to do more social activities, such as playing golf. Asked why Johnson had changed his mind and introduced more draconian restrictions, Gove told the BBC’s Today programme: “We are living in unprecedented times. All of us recognise this is a land of liberty but we are living in a national emergency.” Labour broadly welcomed the lockdown but some opposition politicians suggested it should go further. Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, said there had been a difference of opinion between him and the government, with City Hall pushing for construction sites to shut down. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Labour leadership candidate and shadow business secretary, said people should not just be allowed to “order nice things online” that were not essential.
“There needs to be a tightly defined list of essential workplaces,” she told the Today programme. She also highlighted the uncertainty faced by self-employed people, who do not get the same 80% of salary support as the employed. • This article was amended on 24 March 2020. An earlier version of the graph showing the number of deaths at date of lockdown had the UK figure at 355. This has been corrected to 335."
2020-03-24T06:00:24Z,politics,Politics,Salmond's acquittal could make him the SNP's biggest challenge,"When Nicola Sturgeon addressed a private gathering of Scottish National party politicians at Edinburgh Napier University towards the end of August 2018 and little more than a week after the original sexual harassment allegations against her predecessor Alex Salmond were made public, she spoke frankly: “How we deal with this and how we are seen to respond to this will say a lot about who we are as a party and also about the country we are today and want to build for the future.” Speaking outside the high court in Edinburgh on Monday afternoon following his acquittal on 13 charges of sexual assault, Alex Salmond suggested that the verdicts would ultimately say something very different about the SNP. He referred to “certain evidence I would like to have seen led in this trial”, which would now “see the light of day”. Sources close to the former first minister were already briefing his belief that Nicola Sturgeon herself played a role. As Salmond’s supporters welcomed the verdicts, calling variously for unnamed heads to roll and an independent inquiry into the SNP’s handling of complaints, and the Scottish Conservative opposition at Holyrood described “a national political scandal with profound questions of integrity for the first minister and her SNP government”, it was clear that when the coronavirus pandemic has abated the issue will return to the top of the political agenda. The verdict brought the most significant case in Scottish legal history to an end – but it also marked a new chapter in a fight that could tear the party leadership apart. A key Salmond ally, Joanna Cherry, the prominent MP who last year garnered plaudits for leading the successful legal challenge to the prorogation of parliament, said that Salmond should be allowed to rejoin the SNP “without delay” after his resignation in August 2018 to avoid causing “substantial internal division” as he put it at the time. As he resigned, the former SNP leader announced that he had set up a crowdfunder to support his judicial review of the Scottish government’s handling of the allegations. He attracted more than double the initial target within three days after more than 4,100 individuals donated a total of £100,000, underlining the loyalty that Salmond continued to command among senior figures and also rank and file independence supporters. It is often said that the SNP is a party like no other; that it is configured more like a family, led by a tight-knit group who have kept faith together across decades of public derision and unpopularity. Their loyalties were forged in opposition long before the party became the electoral force it is now. There have been some spectacular internal disagreements – changing policy on Nato membership in 2012, for example – and personality clashes. But these have always been eclipsed by the overarching project of independence for Scotland and a pragmatic recognition of the discipline and unity required to achieve that.
At the heart of the SNP family was the relationship between Sturgeon and her “friend and mentor”, as she so often described him, Salmond. He once described it as an “unstoppable partnership”. It now lies fractured beyond repair. By Sturgeon’s own admission, the pair have not spoken since July 2018. Strain and distress were etched on her face as she responded to the reports of Salmond’s arrest in January 2019. In the same month, Salmond accused Sturgeon of “rewriting history” after his pivotal role in the rise of the SNP was excised from the party website. Older activists in particular reflect Salmond’s furious sense of betrayal that Sturgeon’s code of conduct for the Scottish government introduced in 2017 applied retrospectively to former ministers. It was as though the new code was designed to catch him out, some believed. In court, Salmond set out his own firm conviction that witness A, a senior Scottish government official, had orchestrated the charges, encouraging a number of other women to make claims against him that they would not previously have done. Much of the Salmond camp’s criticism is also directed at Leslie Evans, Scotland’s chief civil servant who drafted the code with Sturgeon, and her oversight of the initial sexual harassment investigation, which the Scottish government was forced to concede was “tainted by apparent bias”, and whose role cannot escape tough scrutiny in the forthcoming parliamentary inquiry. There is also a significant intersection between those who have spoken publicly in support of Salmond, those who are critical of what they consider to be an overly cautious strategy on independence, and those who have concerns about the Scottish government’s plans for transgender legal reform. The forthcoming contest for the Edinburgh Central seat between two of the SNP’s most influential figures lays the divisions bare. Joanna Cherry is campaigning for the Holyrood seat, as is the SNP’s former Westminster leader and Sturgeon supporter Angus Robertson. Robertson is known to favour a more gradualist approach to independence, while Cherry wants to test Holyrood’s power to hold a second referendum in the courts, and has meanwhile faced social media abuse for her opposition to SNP plans to bring in self-identification for gender recognition certificates, which resulted in a reported showdown between her and fellow MP Mhairi Black at a recent Westminster group meeting. But there are many who dispute that the rift between Salmond and Sturgeon translates into an irreparable split in the party itself, arguing that this fundamentally misunderstands how the ground has shifted since #MeToo, especially for the tens of thousands of SNP members who joined after the first independence referendum, just as Salmond stood down as first minister. Their ambitions for independence, often strongly feminist and focused on equality, became ambitions for their adopted party, with many more women and LGBTQ+ activists becoming involved and demanding the SNP share their values. Salmond’s behaviour once free from the restraints of office – bombastic pronouncements on independence, sexist jokes at the Edinburgh fringe and his long-running show for Kremlin-backed Russian broadcaster RT – likewise perplexed the expanded, modernised party. While it is impossible to overestimate Salmond’s impact on the Scottish independence movement, among many younger activists surveyed by the Guardian, their view of Salmond – brutal as it may be – is as a historical figure, “yesterday’s man”, and “irrelevant”. Observers noted that since her election in November 2014, Nicola Sturgeon has been an unapologetically feminist leader, immediately appointing a gender-balanced cabinet and ushering in a significant change in style and policy. In 2015, she presided over the election of a new cohort of SNP MPs, many of them yes movement mavericks whose interpretation of party loyalty has been radically different from previous incumbents, and in 2016 the SNP group saw a gender and generational shift at the Holyrood elections. But the response to Salmond’s crowdfunder appalled many independence-supporting women, who feared it would deter others from coming forward and that the case could become a lightning rod for existing sexism within the yes movement. Many anticipated the trial with dread, concerned that the proceedings would be politicised to the extent that the voices of the women involved would be drowned out. Following the verdicts, younger female activists tweeted their “disgust” at those seeking to make political capital from the outcome. On the evening of the verdicts, the Twitter hashtag #ibelieveher was trending as Scottish Rape Crisis revealed a spike in calls to its helpline, prompted by the detailed reporting of the trial. Worries about in-fighting after the trial leaving activists disillusioned and demotivated are now academic since Sturgeon herself suspended independence campaigning and urged activists to focus on helping their communities through the pandemic. Party insiders have always been realistic about the difficulties of moving cleanly on from the case with a parliamentary inquiry to come. But such a resounding acquittal for Salmond, and his immediate threat to release more evidence about the involvement of the Sturgeon government’s staff and senior officials in both the initial investigation and subsequent police inquiry, make the coming months all the more dangerous for her government. When the criminal charges were first brought against Salmond, his anger had a ferocity that Sturgeon reportedly was unprepared for. Now some close to Salmond suggest that his sense of betrayal and desire for revenge will now have reached epic proportions. Many have praised Sturgeon’s steadfast and humane leadership thus far through the national health crisis, but it is her predecessor who may yet signify her greatest challenge in the months to come."
2020-03-24T01:16:14Z,politics,Politics,UK coronavirus: Boris Johnson announces strict lockdown across country â€“ as it happened,"Thatâ€™s all from us for this evening. Thanks for reading. Hereâ€™s a summary of the latest news: The most significant set of restrictions on British life in living memory were set in place as the prime minister ordered people to stay in their homes. Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown in a bid to stop the coronavirus outbreak and warned that the police would be called in to enforce it. A swathe of businesses were ordered to close as part of the measures. With notable exceptions, retailers followed pubs and restaurants in being told to shut their doors after a weekend during which many people were still out and about, despite government pleas to isolate themselves. There was widespread support for the measures â€“ but there were also calls for greater clarity. Both the Labour party, which has been calling for such measures, and trade unions largely united behind Boris Johnson as he took the drastic step in what he termed a time of â€œnational emergencyâ€�. But political and trade union opposition also called on No 10 to offer the British people more detail on how, exactly, its plan will work. UK death toll increases to 335. The Department of Health and Social Care released its latest figures, showing that 6,650 people have tested positive for Covid-19 and 335 patients have died. FCO advises all Britons abroad to return home while they still can.The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab said the million or so British people on holiday or working abroad should return home now â€“ before the option to do so disappears altogether. Emergency coronavirus legislation passed the Commons. The bill, which will hand ministers wide-ranging powers as they try to get a grip on the crisis, will pass to the Lords after MPs decided they could wave it through without the need for a vote. You can read a summary of the dayâ€™s earlier events here. And my colleague in Australia, Helen Sullivan, is continuing our global coronavirus coverage here:"
2020-03-23T21:17:11Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson unveils the lockdown that isn't quite a lockdown | John Crace,"This time there was no daily Downing Street press conference. Not even an ersatz People’s PMQs with spoon fed set ups from Classic “Let the old and the vulnerable die” Dom. Because in the last few days it’s become clear Boris Johnson can’t even prepare properly for a scheduled presser. Only the day before he was telling everyone to keep 2 metres away from other people when he was standing about a yard from the government’s deputy chief medical officer. There was a time when he could just about manage two pages of A4 as a briefing paper. Now his concentration span can’t even manage that. So instead a we got a six-minute televised address to the nation. Less chance of any unforced cock-ups and mixed messages that way. Telling people that they should try to keep their distance from one another but a day out to Skegness probably wouldn’t hurt hadn’t proved a spectacular success. So this time Boris tried to get serious. People should stay indoors, other than to exercise on their own or with family members, do essential shopping or go to work. It wasn’t a total lockdown, but as good as.
The weird thing was, he was only telling most people something they had already clocked long before him. It’s been the country nudging the government into action, rather than the other way round. After all, these were the sensible measures many had already taken. On the coronavirus, the UK has had two months to learn from China what was coming and to to make necessary preparations. And in that time Boris had managed to do next to nothing, apart from taking a week off over the half-term recess to pick a wedding date and argue over baby names. Still, he must be running out of possibilities by now. What was seemingly incomprehensible to Boris was that people really were now more interested in saving their own lives and those of others than being able to have a drink and a snout with Nigel Farage, Tim Wetherspoon and other members of the Brexit libertarian death cult. Earlier in the day during the debate on the coronavirus emergency contingencies bill in the Commons, Needy Matt Hancock, who’s aged so much in the last few days he no longer needs to be IDed in offies, had said: “The government had made the most comprehensive public communications plans in history.” Presumably he reckons recent messages to be the best since “a leech a day keeps the doctor away”. Still, better late than never. At least he had now heard of the police: a security enforcement service that had caught him by surprise the day before, though his hymn to the NHS felt hollow from a government that had cut its resources significantly over the past 10 years. But this was a last chance to head off a catastrophe on the Italian scale. Boris looked thoroughly miserable as he was making the statement. Not just because of the gravity, but because even he couldn’t escape the irony. Imagine a person who has built his entire career on being economical with the truth having to implore everyone to trust him. A prime minister who doesn’t even look as if he could tell the truth to his reflection. All his life Boris has wanted to be Churchill. Now he has met his Dunkirk, he realises he just can’t do it. He doesn’t have the leadership. He wants to be loved too much. Inside he’s a ball of foetal need. The tousled hair is no longer endearing. Now it just looks shambolic. And the mind is as confused as the barnet. He’s never come across a difficult decision he hasn’t wanted to fudge. Marriages, affairs, Brexit. All compartmentalised away into a happy place where there are no consequences. Being Draco the Lawmaker just doesn’t sit well with him. Now the lives of thousands of people are at stake, and he can’t bear the responsibility. He was only ever in it for the lols. He clasped his hands, as if trying to hold himself together, but his body is folding in on itself. Bags upon bags upon bags. Soon all that will be left is a pool of blubbery blob, its voice a faint echo of Rob Brydon’s “small man trapped in a box”. With the odd bit of Latin thrown in."
2020-03-23T20:57:09Z,politics,Politics,Alex Salmond's court win leaves questions over role of SNP,"Over nearly nine days of often contradictory and emotionally charged evidence, the jurors in Alex Salmond’s trial on 14 charges of sexual assault heard two conflicting accounts of the former first minister. One version was of an often bad-tempered boss who drove his staff hard, with poor judgment about personal space. His defence advocate, Gordon Jackson QC, told the jury of nine women and six men that Salmond was flawed but not evil; he was certainly not a man guilty of criminality or an attempt to rape. “This comes out of a political bubble with no real independent support of any kind,” Jackson said. Many of the charges smelled, he added, of political persecution. “This is a murky, murky world we live in,” he said. Salmond insisted some charges were “a fabrication from start to finish”. The prosecution portrayed Salmond as a predator, who abused his power and authority to assault younger women, often at night in the seclusion of his Bute House official residence in Edinburgh’s Georgian New Town. “This case isn’t about a plot or political conspiracy,” Alex Prentice QC told them. “This is about a powerful man who abused his power to satisfy his sexual desires with impunity.” In the event, the jury – reduced on Monday from 15 to 13 after two jury members were discharged, accepted Jackson’s account. In a verdict that sent shockwaves through the Scottish National party, they acquitted Salmond of every charge on majority verdicts. He had already been acquitted of a 10th sexual assault after the prosecution withdrew the charge earlier in the trial. Speaking outside court on Monday, Salmond issued a thinly concealed warning to his former party and Nicola Sturgeon, his successor as first minister and party leader, that he planned to disclose more evidence in coming days and weeks. “There was certain evidence I would like to have seen [presented] in this trial but for a variety of reasons we weren’t able to do so,” he told the media. “At some point that information, that fact and that evidence will see the light of day.” Salmond’s jubilant allies now believe a forthcoming Scottish parliament inquiry into the Scottish government’s botched handling of an internal investigation into two complaints against him by civil servants will dig deeper into the role played by Sturgeon’s staff and senior officials in that investigation, and the subsequent police inquiry. He has now been exonerated by the jury of any crimes – but the parliamentary investigation could also be significantly expanded after the trial heard how complaints from several civil servants who raised concerns about Salmond’s behaviour were dealt with by their line managers and other senior officials. The court heard that officials in Salmond’s office decided in 2013 and 2014 not to record or seek investigation of their complaints about his behaviour towards them. The women involved told the jury they felt humiliated and embarrassed, and feared making formal complaints would damage their careers or, one told the jury, that the matter would be “swept under the carpet”. They opted instead to do so off the record. After a young junior official accused Salmond of forcing her on to a bed in December 2013 – a charge Salmond denied – senior civil servants in his private office decided among themselves not to allow female officials to work alone at night with him at Bute House, according to evidence. That complainer, known as F because his accusers cannot be named for legal reasons, claimed at Salmond’s trial that he pinned her on a bed and forced his hands up her skirt. She said she did not report the full details of her allegations to her colleagues. Even so, the jury heard that one colleague in Salmond’s office told her the next day: “It could be a crime.” He told the court: “It gave me cause for concern that something serious had happened.” Instead of an investigation, the jury heard that the officials and Salmond’s most senior aide brokered an apology from Salmond. Those officials told the court they felt F wanted the issue kept low-key, so were respecting her wishes. Salmond told the jury that he and F had fallen on to the bed in a “sleepy cuddle” after drinking a potent Chinese spirit while they worked. The jury acquitted him of alleged sexual assault with intent to rape. After a further allegation about an incident at Bute House four months later, the same officials told the court they tried to reinforce the practice of not allowing female officials to work alone there with Salmond. In that case, the court was told, another male civil servant received a distressed late-night text from a younger female colleague, G. She alleged in court that Salmond cornered her in his private sitting room and tried to kiss her after pressing her to drink limoncello with him, which she refused. G said initially she felt “it was never an option” to report the incident internally or to the police. “I felt a huge responsibility to protect his reputation. [I] thought if I got into some sort of scandal with him, it would lose the referendum,” she told the jury. The court heard that a colleague persuaded G to complain informally but she remained deeply doubtful that the process would work. She told the court that she had doubts about the competence of the civil service and feared, correctly, that Salmond would sue the government. In August 2018, Salmond launched a judicial review against his former government after being told an internal civil service inquiry had upheld two sexual assault complaints against him – findings that were not ultimately allowed to stand. After quickly raising £100,000 via crowdfunding to help with his legal costs, he won that challenge in January 2019. The Scottish government repeatedly told journalists in 2017, 2018 and 2019 that no complaints of sexual misconduct or bullying had been made against Salmond until two of these complainers – the legal term in Scotland for complainants – came forward in late 2017, after the #MeToo movement pushed ministers into announcing a zero-tolerance stance on sexual misconduct. According to their testimony in court, none of the women were told their allegations could have been investigated under the Scottish government’s then uniquely far-reaching “fairness at work” procedures, which it introduced in autumn 2010. That policy – the only one of its kind in the UK – specifically included misconduct by Scottish ministers, including first ministers. It committed the government “to dealing with staff grievances fairly, consistently, quickly and no one will be penalised for raising a complaint in good faith”. Appendix 1 of the document set out “examples of unacceptable behaviour”, which included “inappropriate physical contact, advances or propositions” and “inappropriate questions about someone’s personal life or questions about someone’s sex life”. That policy was originally drawn up to handle bullying or mistreatment complaints against civil servants but civil service unions insisted it was expanded to include ministers because of alleged bullying incidents involving Salmond himself. Salmond’s trial heard repeated testimony from defence and prosecution witnesses that he had a fierce temper and was notorious for being aggressive and highly critical with officials he thought were underperforming.
Union sources and those with knowledge of Salmond’s conduct told the Guardian of instances of Salmond swearing at staff, throwing documents at them, and reducing aides to tears. Union sources acknowledge the policy was not written with sexual misconduct specifically in mind, but said it was clear the policy covered misconduct in its broadest sense. Salmond told the jury he had signed off on the policy. It was also agreed by Nicola Sturgeon, then the deputy first minister, and Sir John Elvidge, then the permanent secretary of the Scottish government. Sturgeon agreed to be the arbiter of any complaints involving ministers, including allegations against Salmond.
Despite the fairness at work policy being in place at the time, one female civil servant, complainer B, told the jury she felt unable to complain after she claimed that he tried to force her into a kiss. “I think I would’ve suffered in my career as a result. I never saw anybody in a senior position in the Scottish government tackle the first minister about his behaviour,” she said. Salmond was found not guilty of that allegation. A senior member of Salmond’s policy team at the time, Alex Bell, told the court last week he had been sent upstairs by two other colleagues to ensure she was safe because they had inadvertently left her alone with Salmond. Asked why he had gone up, Bell said: “To ensure that the welfare of my colleague was OK.” Their stance mirrored the policies followed three years later by Salmond’s private secretaries. It took until late 2017 before these women felt confident to report these allegations, when Sturgeon and Scotland’s head civil servant, Leslie Evans, reacted to the #MeToo movement by introducing a tougher code of conduct that specifically included sexual misconduct. Crucially, it applied retrospectively to former ministers. Two of the women who had felt unable to pursue complaints initially stepped forwards, triggering an internal Scottish government inquiry that upheld their complaints. That led the police to investigate, and resulted in Salmond being charged with 14 counts of sexual assault – but ultimately acquitted."
2020-03-23T20:37:18Z,politics,Politics,How UK coronavirus lockdown compares with other countries,"Twenty-three days after Boris Johnson remarked offhandedly that coronavirus is “likely to spread a bit more”, he finally declared a stricter lockdown on Monday, echoing the moves implemented by several other major nations, after days of mounting political pressure to enforce physical distancing measures. Johnson’s comments on 1 March during a visit to Public Health England’s command centre was made when just 35 infections had been confirmed in the UK. Just over three weeks later, in a televised national address, the prime minister has ordered that people can leave their homes only for the most limited purposes, including shopping for essentials, medical needs, to provide care for a vulnerable person, for work or strictly limited exercise. And he said that gathering in groups of more than two was prohibited. The newly announced restrictions follow days of controversy over whether the UK was moving too slowly to force Britons to stay at home except in exceptional circumstances as the death toll reached 335.
Four other large countries with significant outbreaks of the virus have moved at a variety of paces and taken different steps to enact their own lockdowns, most – but not all – acting before reaching the UK’s death toll: China Lockdown in Hubei province begins 23 January with death toll at 17 China, where the first cases of coronavirus emerged, was the first country to announce a major lockdown, in Wuhan and the other big cities in Hubei province. At the time of the announcement, the disease was confirmed to have claimed 17 lives and infected almost 600 other people, although it is not clear how accurate a picture this represents after the first cases emerged in mid-December. In the early hours of 23 January, residents were told that from 10am that day all public transport would be closed and residents of Wuhan were forbidden to leave the city, although large numbers are believed to have fled before the lockdown. By late afternoon, roads from Wuhan and other exits had been shut off.
Italy Lockdown begins 9 March with death toll at 463 and 9,000 infections Italy imposed its lockdown after attempting a limited quarantine of northern towns and then a chaotic quarantine of the north only that led to thousands attempting to flee. The lockdown restricted movement of the population except for necessity, work and health circumstances. Additional restrictions mandated the temporary closure of non-essential shops and businesses. Two days later, the lockdown was tightened to close all commercial and retail businesses except those providing essential services, such as grocery stores and pharmacies.
Spain Lockdown begins 15 March with death toll at 288 and 7,753 cases After a marathon cabinet session the day before, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, told Spaniards they were banned from leaving home except for work and for essential travel. Cases had exploded at the start of the month, with 30 deaths by 9 March. A state of emergency also ordered the closure of all non-essential shops as well as bars, restaurants, cafes, football grounds and cinemas. People are allowed out only to work, to buy food and medicine, to travel to health centres or banks, and to look after the elderly or dependants.
France Lockdown announced on evening of 16 March with death toll at 148 and with 6,633 confirmed cases France had reached China’s 17 deaths around 8 March and moved to a full lockdown just over a week later. Similar to the Italian lockdown, French citizens were tightly restricted, with people expected to stay at home, leaving only for essential activities such as food shopping on pain of a fixed fine of €135. Officials later clarified that a dispensation for exercise meant walks or runs of no more than “1km, 2km max” and close to home. • This article was amended on 25 March 2020. An earlier version of the graph showing the number of deaths at date of lockdown had the UK figure at 355. This has been corrected to 335."
2020-03-23T18:54:54Z,politics,Politics,Alex Salmond acquitted of all charges in sexual assault trial,"Alex Salmond has been acquitted of all charges of sexual assault, a decision that prompted his allies to suggest he had been the victim of a witch-hunt within the Scottish National party. A jury of eight women and five men at the high court in Edinburgh on Monday found Salmond not guilty of 12 charges of attempted rape, sexual assault and indecent assault after about six hours of deliberations. They came to the uniquely Scottish verdict of not proven on one charge of sexual assault with intent to rape, after hearing nearly nine days of evidence. The outcome – greeted by Salmond with praise for the judicial system and a call for Scotland’s attention to return to the threat posed by coronavirus – capped the most significant criminal trial in Scottish political history. It prompted immediate recriminations and demands for resignations within the SNP, which Salmond’s allies and opposition parties said now faced profound questions over its handling of the case. The nine women involved in the charges were all current or former Scottish government officials, or SNP politicians. Nicola Sturgeon’s government has already lost a judicial review started by Salmond into its handling of an internal review of two misconduct complaints against him in 2018.
Joanna Cherry QC, an influential SNP MP, called for Salmond to be allowed to rejoin the party without delay, and for an independent inquiry into the way the party dealt with the allegations. “Some of the evidence that has come to light both in the judicial review and at this trial raise very serious questions over the process that was employed within the Scottish government to investigate the alleged complaints against Mr Salmond, and I am sorry to say some of the evidence also raises serious question marks over how these complaints were handled by the SNP,” she said. Kenny MacAskill, formerly Salmond’s justice secretary and now an SNP MP, welcomed the verdict, tweeting that he was “delighted” for Salmond and that some resignations were “now required”. After the verdicts were read out, Salmond displayed little emotion, but thanked court security officers and the judge, Lady Dorrian, Scotland’s second most senior judge. Speaking outside court afterwards Salmond said his faith in the judicial system had been “much reinforced”. Thanking his friends, family and supporters for standing by him throughout the trial, he said his own “nightmare” could not compare with the coronavirus crisis. After thanking his “exceptional” legal team, Salmond said he planned to release further information about the case at a later date. “As many of you will know, there was certain evidence I would like to have seen led in this trial but for a variety of reasons we weren’t able to do so. At some point that information, that fact and that evidence will see the light of day but it won’t be this day, for a very good reason,” he said. The SNP leader and first minister, Sturgeon, said the verdicts “must be respected”, but added that her focus was currently on steering the country through the coronavirus crisis. “I am a strong believer in a vigorous, robust, independent judicial process where complaints of this nature, if they come forward, are properly and thoroughly investigated, due process takes its course and a court reaches a decision, and that’s what has happened today,” she said. “I have no doubt that there will be further discussion around this issue in due course, in the fullness of time – and I will welcome that. But that time is not now.” In pre-trial court hearings, Salmond’s defence lawyer, Gordon Jackson QC, had told Dorrian there were text messages between complainants, Scottish government officials and SNP officials that raised questions about an orchestration of some of the allegations against his client. Jackson sought to get some of that material admitted into evidence. In January he told Dorrian the defence believed “there was [a] concerted effort made by people in the government to influence this process, to get it as best they could in terms of criminal prosecution”. He alleged those efforts were motivated by revenge because Salmond had won his judicial review in January 2019, after the Scottish government admitted it had botched an internal inquiry into two sexual harassment complaints against him. One of those texts included one sent by Leslie Evans, as permanent secretary the Scottish government’s top civil servant, to another official after they lost the judicial review, which read: “We may have lost the battle, but we will win the war.” Dorrian refused to allow much of that material to be used in court but allowed other messages to be admitted as evidence. Salmond was originally charged with 14 offences but was formally acquitted of one charge, a 10th sexual assault charge, after the prosecution withdrew it halfway through the trial. The not proven verdict on sexual assault with attempt to rape stops short of a finding of not guilty but leaves the accused innocent in the eyes of the law. Two jurors were discharged by the judge on Monday morning, reducing the size of the jury from 15 to 13. Alex Prentice QC, as he summed up the case for the prosecution, told the jury Salmond was a sexual predator who exploited his power to prey on younger, subordinate women. Jackson disputed Prentice’s account. He told the jury there were no direct witnesses to the alleged assaults, and that inconsistencies and contradictions repeatedly cropped up in the evidence. “This comes out of a political bubble with no real independent support of any kind. I said already it smelt and I don’t apologise for that one bit,” he said. “It is the same pattern over and over and over again. It’s scary.” The Scottish Conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw, said the verdicts raised further “serious questions” for the SNP, the Scottish government and Sturgeon, which would be investigated by a forthcoming Scottish parliament inquiry. Pauline McNeill, the Scottish Labour equalities spokeswoman, said the trial was extremely traumatic for all involved, but added: “The verdict of this trial does not take away from the serious concerns about the Scottish government’s handling of this. We would expect questions about this to be fully explored during parliamentary scrutiny of this.” Rape Crisis Scotland thanked the complainants for appearing in court. “Regardless of the verdict, the detailed descriptions and court coverage has been triggering and very hard for many people,” the group said."
2020-03-23T18:23:32Z,politics,Politics,UK under pressure to offer urgent aid to 5 million self-employed,"Pressure is mounting on the government to provide urgent aid to Britain’s 5 million self-employed workers as the coronavirus outbreak intensifies and the economic costs of the crisis dramatically escalate. As the shutdown, in effect, of large sectors of the economy threatens to push millions of people into financial hardship, the Trades Union Congress urged ministers to rapidly extend the worker wage subsidy scheme to the self-employed. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, outlined plans on Friday to pay employees 80% of their salaries, capped at £2,500 a month. However, the self-employed can so far only access £94.25 a week in universal credit benefits and defer their self-assessed tax payments until next year. The TUC, which helped develop the wage subsidy plan alongside business groups and the Treasury, said the government could match the guarantee to help the self-employed, using incomes based on their last three years of self-assessment tax returns. It said payments of at least 80% of incomes could be made directly as a tax rebate. The union umbrella group said countries including Norway and Belgium had already announced similar plans. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: “All workers – both employed and self-employed – should have their wages protected.” Treasury officials are understood to be putting together a fresh financial support package for the self-employed after working over the weekend, although they believe it is more important to get the proposed scheme right than rush it out. Ministers are believed to be grappling with three issues: the technical means of delivering financial help to the self-employed; how the level of support should be calculated; and the need to make sure there is equal treatment for the employed and self-employed. Government sources also said critics were underestimating the impact of the £7bn package of extra welfare spending – including higher universal credit and more generous housing benefit – announced alongside the wage subsidies. However, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and other Labour MPs challenged Sunak on Monday, saying there were still “significant gaps” that urgently needed tackling. Alongside more help for the self-employed, the party said the level of statutory sick pay – currently at £94.25 a week – should be increased. After a sharp rise in the decade since the financial crisis, about 15% of the UK workforce is self-employed, with larger proportions in some sectors and regions, including construction and the creative arts.
Earlier on Monday a former governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, called on ministers to support self-employed people, while warning that the coronavirus crisis posed a more serious threat to the economy than the 2008 financial crash. King, who led the Bank’s response in 2008, said the government should give self-employed workers the same level of support as employees as a minimum first step. “It’s a good starting point because it would be equivalent to the support that’s being given for paying wages,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. A Treasury spokesman said: “We have always said we will go further where we can and are actively considering further steps.”"
2020-03-23T17:30:42Z,politics,Politics,Moira Salmond: the political wife who avoids public life,"Moira Salmond has long been one of the most enigmatic figures in Scottish public life. Married to one of the country’s most famous political leaders for nearly 40 years, she has stayed resolutely in the background, and prefers it there. “I’m no Glenys Kinnock,” she said in her first – and only – media interview, with the Sunday Post in 1990. “I married Alex, not politics. That’s his life and I am happy to be in the background. I share his convictions, but one politician in the family is quite enough.” Other than a few brief appearances with Salmond at election counts, there have been no election broadcast cameos or lifestyle features at their detached period home, a converted former mill in Strichen, Aberdeenshire, where she once reared rare Muscovy ducks. She is said to have been defiant about the allegations against her husband, furious that former allies and colleagues turned against him in a case that ultimately resulted in his acquittal on all charges. Yet, now 82, she remained in Strichen during his court appearances, appearing only once by his side on the final day of his trial in Edinburgh. Instead, Salmond’s sisters Gail and Margaret, and his former office manager Isobel Zambonini, accompanied him as he walked into court for hearings. Rumours circulated for years within the Scottish National party and political circles that Salmond had a series of discreet affairs but it never became a public or political issue. At a press conference in August 2018 Salmond admitted he was no saint, and, as part of his defence, claimed to jurors he had a consensual “liaison” with one complainer and a “sleepy cuddle” with another. Consistently shy of making public appearances in the UK, Moira has rarely provoked media interest. But there was one notable occasion. As Andy Murray celebrated winning Wimbledon in 2013, she pulled a large saltire from her handbag as she and her husband sat behind the then prime minister, David Cameron, in the royal box. The couple held it high, reportedly to the tennis player’s irritation. During Salmond’s seven years as first minister, his wife’s official duties in Scotland were rare and off camera. To her apparent delight, she accompanied him on their annual overnight stays with the Queen during her September holidays at Balmoral, but rarely stayed at Bute House, the first minister’s elegant but unhomely official residence in Edinburgh. She was given her own programme of events when she accompanied her husband on his first visit to the US as first minister in 2008, and again on trips in 2011 and 2012 to Dubai, Qatar and Abu Dhabi. Out of the public gaze, Moira became a significant presence in the SNP in Aberdeenshire, helping at branch events and fundraisers, taking part in Salmond’s private dinners with newspaper editors, friendly business leaders and political allies. She has been his guide, confidante and at times, political strategist. Salmond told one interviewer in 2007 her influence on him was “very substantial. She tells me not to take myself too seriously.” One observer recalls Salmond cadging a cigarette at a party event and pleading like a naughty child: “Don’t tell Moira.”"
2020-03-23T14:53:14Z,politics,Politics,Labour chairman hits back at criticism of coronavirus comments,"The Labour chairman, Ian Lavery, has hit back at criticism after he was recorded saying the coronavirus outbreak gave the party a “great opportunity” to bring people together and get on the “front foot”. His comments sparked outcry among rightwing commentators, Tory politicians and a former Labour MP. They suggested he should apologise for allegedly seizing on the crisis to make political gains. Lavery claimed reports about the recording, obtained by rightwing Westminster blog Guido Fawkes, were misleading and he had been trying to rally grassroots party members to help their local communities and explain that Labour’s established network of campaigners had a significant role to play.
Speaking to thousands of young members who joined an online chat forum on Friday night, the close ally of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was recorded saying: “By the way, when something like this happens, we’re going to see lots of our own dying as a consequence. “But, you know apart from that, it’s going to give the fantastic battalion of Labour party members, community champions out there, a great opportunity of showing how Labour, and why Labour, is best when it gets on the front foot and best when it brings people together.” Responding to the recording of Lavery, former Labour MP Ian Austin, who quit the party over the way it had handled antisemitism complaints, wrote online: “This is shameful.” Lavery, who is MP for Wansbeck in the north-east of England, tweeted that he had been “extremely proud” of the Zoom call, which reached young party activists and that everyone had a role to play in trying to combat the spread of the virus. He wrote: “We have a battalion of over 580,000 members and we need them to help in this crisis.” In another Tweet he wrote: “Intentionally misleading reporting is really disappointing at a time like this. I’ve spoken about the opportunity for people to get out there and help their local communities and those in need. Nonsense to suggest otherwise. We all need to do our bit to get through this crisis.” Young Labour, which organised the conference call, said more than 3,000 members had joined in, with Corbyn also taking part in the discussion. It is part of a series of mass calls being organised by the party to deal with Covid-19, including sessions on workers’ rights and mutual aid groups. After Friday’s call, Young Labour tweeted: “The Labour party will continue to demand more from the government to support insecure workers and the most vulnerable, and Labour members in communities will be the centre of local support.” Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said he was disgusted by Lavery’s remarks, accusing him of “salivating” at the thought of tens of thousands of people dying. A former Tory MEP, Steve Bannerman, who was also a member of Ukip, tweeted: “This disgusting and naked opportunism shows why we suddenly have so many social media attacks on Boris and government handling of Covid-19. Shameful. @UKLabour – would Attlee have done this??” Leftwing commentator and author Aaron Bastani said Lavery was simply highlighting that the response to Covid-19 would “demonstrate the uses of central planning and need for grassroots activism”."
2020-03-23T09:16:28Z,politics,Politics,Hancock accuses those still socialising in UK of being 'very selfish',"Matt Hancock has accused those still socialising of “very selfish” behaviour that risks the lives of NHS workers and others, as he signalled tougher restrictions on movement are likely to be on the way. The health secretary said stricter rules such as curfews or further closures could come into place “very soon” and urged people still socialising or going to holiday locations to “stop it, and if you don’t stop it then we’re going to have to take more measures”. He took a much tougher line than the prime minister on those defying social distancing rules, saying people carrying on as usual were being “incredibly unfair to go and socialise in the way we have seen”. “By helping spread the virus they slow down our ability to stop it. It means all these measures are going to have to be in place for longer. If you follow the rules you are helping the country to get through this as quickly as possible,” he told BBC Breakfast. Asked on the Today programme why people are defying government instructions, he said: “I don’t know because it is very selfish. The consequence of that costs lives and it means for everyone this will go on for longer … “It is incredibly important that people stay more than two metres away from others wherever they are or stay at home wherever possible. “It’s important people get exercise but they should do it staying away from others.”
Johnson warned on Sunday that the UK could face an Italy-style lockdown within days if the public do not keep two metres apart but he also stressed that he wanted people to enjoy the outdoors, prompting claims he was sending out mixed messages. Johnson has refused to directly criticise those ignoring government advice but Hancock specifically hit out at those who were carrying on socialising as usual for “putting people in the NHS at risk” and said the government was “absolutely prepared” to bring in tougher measures. He told Sky News: “It’s what we might have to do to protect life ... We’re taking these actions earlier in the epidemic than others European countries, but we’ve seen what’s happened in other European countries.” In a round of broadcast interviews, he acknowledged problems with NHS medical staff getting the right protective clothing to keep them safe from coronavirus and signalled that new lockdown measures could come in “very soon”.
Hancock promised the army would help deliver personal protective equipment (PPE), after pleas from medics for the necessary masks, goggles and protective clothing. With reports of nurses wearing bin bags and doctors being given out-of-date masks, Hancock said he took responsibility for improving the situation. “I am determined to ensure that the right kit gets to the right hospital, the right ambulance service, the right doctors’ surgery, right across the country,” said Hancock. “There have been challenges and I can see that. We’re on it and trying to solve all the problems. “I take very seriously my responsibility, as secretary of state, to make sure that everybody working in the NHS, across social care, is safe, and for that they need the right equipment.” Rosena Allin-Khan, the Labour deputy leadership contender and medic, reported that doctors were running out of PPE when she worked an A&E shift over the weekend. “Are we scared? Of course we are ... but we need to have the PPE to keep us safe and practise social distancing. In a matter of days or a couple of weeks we will be having to make life or death decisions,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The government insisted that 200 hospitals, ambulance trusts, GP practices, pharmacists, care homes and hospices had all been receiving additional supplies over the past week, with the kit drops set to continue to match demand. From this week the army will start to help to manage and offload supplies in NHS settings, and distribute urgent PPE supplies to the frontline during the coronavirus epidemic. Hancock also revealed that the NHS now has 12,000 ventilators, up from 5,000, but the difficulty will be ensuring enough trained staff to use them."
2020-03-22T13:45:20Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak faces legal action from gig economy workers,"Pressure is mounting on Rishi Sunak to extend his coronavirus bailout to the UK’s five million self-employed people, with gig workers threatening legal action against the chancellor’s current “discriminatory” policy and a survey suggesting half would keep working if they had symptoms. On Friday, Sunak said self-employed workers could access £94.25 a week in universal credit, but he gave a far more generous deal to employees of 80% of salaries, capped at £2,500 per month. He is being lobbied to go further in coming days or risk public health by incentivising self-employed taxi-drivers, couriers and other gig economy workers and zero-hours contractors to keep working while ill. The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain says the exclusion of the self-employed from Friday’s promise amounts to discrimination and is a risk to public health. On Monday its lawyers, Leigh Day, will send a pre-action letter ahead of issuing proceedings for a high court judicial review. It also argues that the sick pay is too low for many employees. Linda Artega, a self-employed cleaner and union member, said the current arrangement means she would have to “choose between buying food for my family and following the government’s health advice”. Jason Moyer-Lee, the union’s general secretary, said: “Low-paid and precarious workers are on the front lines of this crisis distributing food, delivering medical samples, cleaning buildings and looking after children in need, yet they have the least protection. “No one wants to be litigating right now, but we also cannot stand by while our members are exposed to unnecessary risk or driven into destitution.” The move comes as a survey conducted on Wednesday and Thursday showed 47% of the self-employed and 51% in “atypical” work, such as those on zero-hours contracts, would feel obliged to work even if they had the virus.
The Populus survey for the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) was carried out before Sunak’s announcement. However, the number of people willing to work while sick is likely to still be significant. The survey found only 16% of all workers agree statutory sick pay, equivalent to the £95 offered so far, would meet their basic needs. The government has indicated it wanted to do more for the self-employed but it is operationally difficult. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, said on Sunday the government knows “this isn’t perfect”. “The chancellor is going to keep reviewing the situation and see if there are further measures we can take,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. “It isn’t easy, it’s not as simple as supporting those who are in employment. The purpose of our employment mechanism is to help continue the connection between employees and their business so once this is over – and it will be over – those individuals can return to their usual work and that link isn’t broken. “It is operationally very difficult to create a scheme akin to that for the self-employed but we are reviewing this. If there are further steps we need to do, we will take them.” Freelance groups, from actors and musicians to minicab and delivery drivers, have complained about what they say is unfair treatment. Uber drivers said without help they “face the abyss”. Their union, the United Private Hire Drivers, has warned the lack of help for the self-employed so far “shows the brunt of the burden of the pandemic is falling unequally”. It notes that in London alone, 94% of private hire drivers are from black and minority ethnic communities. “We can’t afford to miss anyone right now,” said Anthony Painter, chief research and impact officer at the RSA, which said the “lack of universalism seriously risks public health”. The RSA’s chief executive is Matthew Taylor, a former Downing Street adviser. Taylor, who advised Theresa May’s government on reforming work in Britain, said the RSA saw “immediate universal income as a war necessity”. After the crisis has passed, a universal basic income could remain in place “as an economically secure path for workers in the 2020s”, it said. “Universal healthcare and universal economic security go hand-in-hand,” Painter said. “It is clear from this survey that workers are already putting themselves in harm’s way, feel they are highly vulnerable, and could be suffering mental distress as a result of coronavirus and economic insecurity. This affects those in ‘atypical’ work such as the self-employed, gig and temp workers more.” The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE) is calling for Sunak to offer self-employed workers 80% of their wages, as he has done for employees whose employers have no work for them. It believes this could be assessed and delivered through the self-assessment tax system millions of freelancers already use. IPSE’s policy director, Andy Chamberlain, said: “In this drastic and grave situation, we urge the prime minister and chancellor to match the steps they have taken for employees and create a temporary income protection fund for the self-employed. “This should give a temporary, targeted cash injection to the freelance businesses that are struggling most – a financial boost to make up for lost income and keep them afloat.” • This article was amended on 23 March 2020 to correct the name of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain."
2020-03-22T12:12:54Z,politics,Politics,No 10 denies claim Dominic Cummings argued to 'let old people die',"Downing Street has rejected as “a highly defamatory fabrication” a claim that Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, initially argued against strict measures to contain coronavirus in a view summarised as “if that means some pensioners die, too bad”. In an unusual on-the-record denunciation, a Downing Street spokesman said the claims about Cummings’ viewpoint, made in a Sunday Times article, had not been put to No 10 in advance and contained “invented” quotes. The report claimed that at one private event at the end of February, Cummings outlined then government’s strategy at the time in a way that was summarised by some present as “herd immunity, protect the economy, and if that means some pensioners die, too bad.” The allegations, which have been widely shared online, connect with wider criticisms that the government response to the virus was initially too weak, based on a notion that rather than limiting its spread, enough people could be allowed to contract it to give population-wide “herd immunity”. While the phrase “herd immunity” was used by government figures such as Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, No 10 has denied it was ever a tactic. However, the use of the phrase illustrated initial tensions within government over how to balance the economic impact of a full national lockdown against the potential number of deaths from the virus. According to the Sunday Times report, the key moment came on 12 March when a group of government experts gathered to examine modelling of the spread of the virus carried out by academics at Imperial College London and elsewhere. This predicted that if no action was taken more than half a million people would die, and that even some limited mitigation efforts would only halve this. The Sunday Times report said this changed the mind of Cummings, who before had been an adherent of the herd immunity idea. After the 12 March meeting, Cummings changed his view and became one of the strongest advocates in government for tough restrictions to curb the spread of the virus, the Sunday Times said. It quoted one anonymous senior Conservative as saying: “He’s gone from ‘herd immunity and let the old people die’ to ‘let’s shut down the country and the economy’.” The Downing Street spokesman said: “This is a highly defamatory fabrication which was not put to No 10 by the Sunday Times before publication. The article also includes a series of apparent quotes from meetings which are invented.” Cummings is already a controversial figure within government. The former Vote Leave strategist is regularly portrayed as an ideologue and hidden power over Johnson. In January, Cummings’ call for “misfits and weirdos” to work in No 10 led to the appointment of Andrew Sabisky, who soon had to step down because of previously stated views on subjects ranging from black people’s IQs to whether benefits claimants should be encouraged to have fewer children. It later emerged that in his own prior writings, Cummings had suggested that the NHS should cover the cost of selecting babies to have higher IQs."
2020-03-22T06:51:01Z,politics,Politics,"‘Corbynism without Corbyn’ will destroy Labour, says Wes Streeting","A Labour party that espouses “Corbynism without Corbyn” risks disappearing from the political map, a Labour MP has warned. In a new pamphlet with the Fabian Society, Wes Streeting, an MP on the right of the party who has been a persistent critic of Jeremy Corbyn, urges the party to leave the current leader’s legacy behind to give it a chance of regaining mainstream public support. In a plea to change course, Streeting warns that the party’s existence will again be threatened should it continue with some of Corbyn’s key political tenets such as his approach to foreign policy, nationalisation and uncosted spending commitments outside a time of crisis. “There is no future for the Labour party in Corbynism without Corbyn,” Streeting writes. “The next leader of the Labour party needs to hit a big reset button and to do so loudly enough that the voters notice. That doesn’t mean that we need to jettison every policy, embrace the damaging economics of austerity or seek solace in past victories. “But it does mean building transformational economic policy that people can believe in, a worldview that provides security and opportunity in turbulent times and a political culture that is open, welcoming and inclusive.” In “Let Us Face the Future Again”, Streeting calls on Labour to concentrate on economic inequality, our ageing society, technological revolution, the climate emergency and shifting global power.
“There is no future for the Labour party if the debate about our future becomes locked in an ideological battle between two competing visions of the past instead of building a new politics that can unite the country around a vision for the future,” he writes. The intervention will anger the party’s left, which is facing a major challenge to its domination of the party’s leadership, which it secured with the arrival of Corbyn in 2015 and his overwhelming re-election in 2016 after an attempt to oust him. It is also a message to the next leader – likely to be Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary. Streeting criticises what he calls “Corbynomics”, attacking the suggestion that only the top 5% of earners would need to pay more tax under Labour’s plans and its “inclusive ownership fund” – which he describes as “a massive tax grab and attempt to nationalise a significant chunk of British business”. He writes: “Unless we face the future with answers to the real and dangerous challenges facing our country and our world we risk becoming a cautionary tale to future generations about how it was that a once-major political party managed to… stall progress, empower our opponents and disappear quietly into a vacuum of our own making.”"
2020-03-21T16:32:00Z,politics,Politics,Theresa May’s social injustice office ‘doesn’t exist – and never will’,"A new body promised by Theresa May to tackle “deep-seated societal injustices” has never been convened and never will be, the Observer has been told. The former prime minister’s pledge to create the Office for Tackling Injustices (OfTI) won praise from inequality campaigners, who said it was an important part of the battle to reduce opportunity disparities over race, gender, deprivation, sexuality and disability. The chair of the new office was also announced when May unveiled the plan last summer. May, who in her first speech as prime minister in July 2016 pledged to fight against “burning injustice”, said she wanted it to hold “government and wider society to account”. However, more than eight months after May revealed the plan, the office has never been convened – with some of those involved believing it will never be established. Some said they had not received any contact about it since its unveiling. No budget or remit has ever been published or agreed. One of those hoping to work with the office said the lack of progress was “very frustrating”. “It doesn’t exist – it is never going to exist,” said one person involved. “It has been thrown into the long grass. This was a big opportunity to find the evidence and act on it, but it is not being used. People involved in it have never even been told what the plan was. They have heard nothing. It is a shame because this agenda is important – there are huge issues around race, disability and gender that this would have helped.” The OfTI was intended to work independently of the government, but with resources supplied by the Cabinet Office. It was to bring together the latest research and data to give a clear picture of the inequalities faced by different groups. It is a similar approach to the Race Disparity Audit, which highlighted the huge differences in life experiences and outcomes that ethnic minorities face compared with their white British counterparts. However, the new office was always derided by many Tories and Whitehall insiders, who regarded it as nothing more than a desperate attempt by May to preserve any kind of legacy after a premiership dominated by a failure to break the Brexit gridlock. Baroness Ruby McGregor-Smith, the former business executive who was to chair the new office, said she was not surprised that the office had not yet been formed. She said that the coronavirus crisis meant it was right that resources were directed elsewhere, but urged the government to return to the idea at the right time. “I’m passionate about equality in the UK and I’m really keen for OfTI to go ahead. It isn’t surprising because of the demands around Europe, and now Covid-19, that this hasn’t kicked off. After Covid-19 has passed, we should look at picking it back up, but not until then. Being equal, and having no disadvantage because of your background, is important to anybody. After Covid-19 has passed, this agenda will matter more than ever.” The office won significant backing at the time of its launch. Ruth Hunt, the former chief executive of Stonewall, said it would “give us a clearer picture of the barriers and better enable us to act against the discrimination LGBT people still face”. Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote (who was made a life peer in May’s resignation honours list), said the new office would assess the government’s progress towards social justice in the same way that the Office for Budget Responsibility acts as an independent watchdog over the public finances. “I believe it will become a shining beacon,” he said, adding it would be “a powerful bulwark for change”. A government spokesperson said: “The government is considering how best to take forward the work of the Office for Tackling Injustices in the light of the new domestic priorities. We are absolutely committed to ensuring that everyone, regardless of their backgrounds, has the support they need. “We will tackle prejudice, racism and discrimination and address the complex reasons why some groups do less well at school, earn less at work, or are more likely to be victims of crime and have committed to investing at least £90m to reduce youth employment disparities.”"
2020-03-21T15:13:40Z,politics,Politics,US trade deal ‘could flood Britain with toxic cosmetics’,"A UK trade deal with the US will see the relaxation of stringent laws prohibiting the use of dangerous ingredients in imported cosmetics, campaigners are warning. Concerns about food that could be imported under a deal – in particular chicken washed with chlorine – have been widely aired. But so far little attention has been given to products made by other industries. However, the trade campaign group Global Justice Now claims that US cosmetic products which use chemicals currently banned in the EU could soon find their way to the UK. More than 1,300 toxic ingredients have been banned from use in cosmetics in the UK, with restrictions on a further 500 ingredients. In comparison, only 11 are banned in the US, according to the group. It points out that animal testing of cosmetics is legal in the US, but banned in the UK. “Chemical regulation in the US is like the wild west – it’s what happens when you allow big business to dictate the rules, rather than thinking about consumer protection or the need to protect the environment,” said the group’s director Nick Dearden. “And with Trump in charge, it’s getting worse by the week. Our big worry here is that, under a trade deal with the US, parts of this system will be imported into Britain, and that the concerns people have rightly voiced about chlorine chicken will be expanded to all manner of products that people use on their body.” As with food, in the US the burden lies chiefly with the regulator to prove something is unsafe rather than with business to demonstrate that it is safe. Campaigners blame this approach for a number of high-profile safety lapses.
In 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration confirmed that asbestos had been found in several cosmetic products, including makeup marketed at children. Other chemical substances freely available in US products but banned in the UK include formaldehyde, a carcinogen used in hair-straightening treatments, nail polish and eyelash glue; parabens, which are used in skin and hair products and have a tendency to mimic oestrogen in the body, disrupting the hormonal system; p-Phenylenediamine, an organic compound derived from coal tar and used in hair dyes which can trigger severe allergic reactions; triclosan, an antibacterial agent used in soaps and toothpastes which is believed to spread antibiotic resistance; and phthalates which are found in perfumes and shampoo and can lower semen quality. US negotiators stress that a key aim of any trade deal would be to “promote greater regulatory compatibility to reduce burdens associated with unnecessary differences in regulations and standards, including through regulatory cooperation where appropriate”. But Dearden claims this would cede too much power to business: “Boris Johnson has talked about the US’s so-called ‘science-based’ system. But that’s a shorthand for a system in which big corporations dictate the rules.” A spokesman for the Department for International Trade said: “The government has been very clear that any future trade deal must work for UK consumers and businesses, upholding our high regulatory standards. The UK’s reputation for quality, safety and performance is what drives demand for UK goods and is key to our long-term prosperity. We have no intention of harming this reputation in pursuit of a trade deal.”"

2020-03-20T13:11:40Z,politics,Politics,UK bus firms call for £1bn aid to maintain vital services,"Britain’s bus operators have called for the government to provide £1bn in urgent aid to maintain critical services, as passenger numbers fall away because of the coronavirus. The numbers travelling have fallen by more than half outside London, with a loss of £50m a week in revenues, according to operators, and are expected to drop further with the closure of schools from Friday. Older passengers with concessionary passes who make up a large proportion of bus users are also expected to heed advice to self-isolate. The government had recently pledgedan extra £5bn over five years in recognition of the importance of bus services, which have dwindled during a decade of funding cuts. However, the coronavirus outbreak has led firms to demand immediate aid. Graham Vidler, the chief executive of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents bus companies, said: “Operators are under extreme pressure and facing impossible choices over which routes they have to cut and how many staff may have to go. We urgently need the government to help now to secure the future of the industry.” Firms collectively employ about 100,000 drivers and 120,000 support staff. More journeys are made by buses than trains, not least by key workers and the public to reach hospitals. The confederation said companies were ready to help the national response to the crisis in different ways, possibly using buses as mobile grocery stores for people self-isolating, or as mobile virus testing units. Meanwhile, train companies started to confirm which services would be pared back across Britain from Monday, with passengers urged to stop all non-essential travel. About half the timetable will be cut after ministers and rail operators across England, Scotland and Wales agreed to ensure core services and freight could keep running. Operators pledged to run enough trains for key workers and to allow the public to access medical appointments, as well as maintaining the flow of goods by rail. Franchised train operators have minimum service obligations and could have faced contractual penalties without government dispensation. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “We are taking decisive action to protect the public, which means reducing travel for the time being, whilst still ensuring key worker heroes can get to their jobs to keep this nation running.” Shapps suggested this week that more rail networks could be temporarily nationalised but the government would be “flexible” over contracts. Several franchises were in financial difficulty because of stalling passenger numbers even before the current crisis. Almost 70% fewer rail journeys have been made since the outbreak started, according to the Department for Transport. As well as responding to reduced demand, train operators are preparing for mass absences of staff. Operators will publish next week’s schedules by Sunday lunchtime. Many, including Northern, have already been forced to cancel dozens of trains at short notice because of sickness and self-isolation. It expects to be running rail replacement buses as part of its revised timetable. Among the first to announce emergency timetables on Friday were London and south-east commuter franchises. South Western Railway will cut all services on some branches, last trains will depart earlier from London Waterloo, and major lines will have only half-hour or hourly services, particularly outside peak hours. Southeastern said it would attempt to keep all stations open for now and stretch schedules over as much of the day as possible. Govia Thameslink Railway said it would make a second batch of cuts in a week’s time, and has already slashed trains to Gatwick airport. Network Rail has said retailers in its stations will not have to pay rent for the first quarter. In the capital, a reduced London Underground service has come into effect with the closure of 40 stations and the axing of the night tube. National Express said it would be running only a limited number of its nationwide coach services from Tuesday."
2020-03-19T18:46:34Z,politics,Politics,What we wouldn't give for a Gordon Brown or John Major right now | John Crace,"The government appears to have taken the unusual decision to run a mañana culture. I’ve no doubt ministers and civil servants are working flat out on solutions to the coronavirus crisis, but so far they don’t appear to have a great deal to show for their efforts. It’s as though everyone is looking at someone else to come up with the ideas. Other countries, such as Denmark and New Zealand, that were four weeks behind us in reporting their first cases, are now streets ahead of us in their health and financial bailout preparations. The UK motto appears to be “keep calm and muddle on”. Something may turn up. Though it probably won’t. It’s not just Boris Johnson’s fundamental lack of plausibility that is the problem. At Thursday evening’s daily Downing Street press conference, he seemed to have totally lost the plot. After a few days of trying to do “serious face” he had reverted to his default end-of-the-pier-show act; the Archie Rice who could no longer even entertain himself. Back were all the familiar smirks, knowing nods and third-rate gags. He sounded tonally deaf, totally at odds with the mood of the nation. When the country wants a man of substance, we get a man of straw. Coronavirus was back to being some kind of comic-book super-villain. We’d give it a good smack on the nose, dig deep for 12 weeks, and then everything would be more or less back to normal. First we take coronavirus, then we take Brexit. Both were things that could be “got done”. It’s not even as if Boris intentionally means to be glib. He’s desperate to be seen as a great leader. It’s just that he’s fundamentally psychologically flawed. He genuinely can’t bear anything that is too real or too meaningful as it exposes his narcissistic wound that can never heal. So he has to deflect, make light, minimise. Anything but empathy. That costs him far too much. What most of us wouldn’t give for a Gordon Brown or a John Major right now. Or even a Theresa May. Words I thought I’d never write. At least there was an integrity to her incompetence. You could trust her to do the wrong thing for the right reason. It’s the rest of the cabinet too, almost all of whom can be trusted to fall to the occasion. Take Gavin Williamson’s decision – some might argue a touch late – to close all schools in England at the weekend. Now it’s not as if this can have taken the country’s favourite fireplace salesman by surprise. He’s had a good six weeks to prepare for an event that everyone but him knew would sooner or later be inevitable. Yet at last night’s Downing Street press conference, he was seemingly blindsided by some of the most obvious questions, such as the details of how children of key workers would remain in school – which members of staff would be the designated teachers – and even what jobs qualified as key worker status. Gav, you had one job. One job.
Rishi Sunak’s £330bn Tuesday bailout was rather better received – the scale of the package suggested there was some form of intelligent life in cabinet – but after two days of going through the fine detail, those MPs who were still coming to the Commons had come to the conclusion there was rather less to the chancellor’s plan than had met the eye. So the former business secretary Greg Clark was granted an urgent question to find out if the Treasury had any better idea of what it was doing than any other department. The chancellor wisely chose to duck the session. It was left to the most junior treasury minister, the unfortunate John Glen, to take the hit. Right from the off, he had the air of the condemned man.
At times he looked on the verge of tears. Like so many others, he hadn’t come into Boris’s government to have to deal with this kind of shitshow. He was just an average bloke who happened to have got lucky and had been looking forward to the Brexit crack. Even though he had never actually believed in it. MPs from all sides piled in. This just wasn’t good enough, said Clark. Businesses were facing collapse. People were being laid off. Action was needed now and workers could be given cash handouts through the PAYE system. “Um … er … ” Glen mumbled, desperate for some divine intervention. Even Iain Duncan Smith got in on the act. Normally there’s nothing he likes more than to grind down the most vulnerable members of society, to make them sweat for every penny they get out of the state. For him, poverty is a life choice for the congenitally idle. But now he was overwhelmed with compassion. He was determined that the whole purpose of the universal credit system he had introduced had only been to make it easier for people to receive their payouts. So what he wanted was for the universal credit taps to be turned on full so that the money could flow. Along with milk and honey. It was one of parliament’s greatest Damascene conversions. But IDS had set the tone, and soon every Tory was standing shoulder to shoulder with the opposition benches. The revolution was being televised and it started here. “I will make sure the Treasury hears MPs’ concerns,” Glen said tartly, his tears of self-pity having given way to something more like passive aggression. He had been sent out to take a beating in the Commons, and someone in the Treasury would get it in the neck when he got back."
2020-03-19T18:43:13Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson says he expects mass Covid-19 testing to be possible soon – as it happened,"Boris Johnson told the daily press conference the UK can â€˜turn the tideâ€™ in the fight against coronavirus within the next 12 weeks. The Prime Minister said the first British patient had been put in a randomised trial for a treatment for coronavirus, and he expected relatively soon the government would be able to do mass testing to see if people had contracted it. Police, public health and immigration officers have been given powers to detain anyone suspected of being infected with coronavirus under new emergency powers rolled out by the government. The emergency legislation also gives the government sweeping powers to close premises and ban gatherings. The UK death toll rose to 144 as a further 29 patients died in England. The patients were aged between 47 and 96 years old and had underlying health conditions. Scottish deaths doubled to six and the first death in Northern Ireland was recorded. The Bank of England slashed interest rates to an all-time low of 0.1%, a week after rates were cut to 0.25% to address the coronavirus crisis. The capital saw dozens of London Underground stations close as part of measures to enforce social distancing and slow the spread of the virus. Figures show that around 4 in 10 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK so far have been in London. London mayor Sadiq Khan said bans may be needed to stop people gathering in bars, restaurants and continuing to mix together in defiance of expert advice. He also said peopleâ€™s civil liberties may have to be curtailed to stop more lives being lost to the Covid-19 virus. Boris Johnson continued to deny there were plans to shut down the London Underground. The Queen issued a message to the nation that in this period of great concern and uncertainty â€œwe all have a vitally important part to play as individualsâ€� in the days, weeks and months ahead. Weddings and baptisms should be significantly scaled back under new guidance issued by the Church of England. Weddings should be restricted to five people and baptisms should be limited to meet the need for social distancing. Supermarket staff are to be counted as key workers whose children can stay at school, the environment secretary George Eustice said. Guidance on how pupils unable to sit exams are to be graded is to be published tomorrow, the education secretary Gavin Williamson said. Train, coach and bus services across the country have been cut as passengers stay away, including South Western Railway, Great Western Railway and National Express.

2020-03-19T14:28:33Z,politics,Politics,Home Office tasked with putting fairness first after Windrush,"In her report on the Windrush scandal, Wendy Williams does not quite brand the Home Office institutionally racist – but she comes close. Williams’ finding that failings within the department amounted to an “institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race” that was consistent with “some elements of the definition of institutional racism” should prompt some significant soul-searching. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has pledged to review the recommendations and pay close detail to the way her department “views the communities it serves”. Crucially, she has committed to looking at the government’s “compliant environment policies”, more often known as the “hostile environment”. The Home Office is already facing mounting calls to scrap the policies, which, if not the cause of the Windrush scandal, undoubtedly compounded it. Introduced by Theresa May as home secretary in two immigration acts in 2014 and 2016, the policies essentially empowered a range of figures across society to become immigration enforcement officers. Landlords were required to conduct right-to-rent checks, doctors were asked to assess the immigration statuses of the sick before they were treated, and checks by banks and employers were also demanded. In her review, Williams makes clear that the hostile environment evolved under the Labour, coalition and Conservative governments successively and does not pin the blame on the 2014 and 2016 acts exclusively. However, those powers remain, and dismantling or reworking them would be a significant step forward in aiding the cultural change that Williams is calling for. Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, said: “We need to see urgent action now on the hostile environment, on overhauling casework culture and the culture of targets in the Home Office, to ensure that the same cultural and organisational concerns we have previously raised do not lead to more scandals like this in the future.” On the issue of race, Williams is clear that the Home Office needs to review its diversity, inclusion and unconscious-bias awareness training, and tackle its lack of senior figures from minority backgrounds. But she goes beyond classic HR solutions. She suggests new Home Office staff should be educated on the history of the UK and its relationship with the rest of the world, including Britain’s colonial history, the history of inward and outward migration and the history of black Britons. Ultimately, Williams says this goes to the heart of what the Home Office stands for. What is its purpose? Her answer is to say that the home secretary should set a clear mission statement that has at its core “fairness, humanity, openness, diversity and inclusion”.
Patel committed to clarifying the department’s purpose in this spirit, adding: “I want to make the Home Office a better place to work.” But as far as the immigration directorates work, the proposals come at a complicated time. The home secretary has tasked her officials with overhauling the immigration system for post-Brexit Britain, with a point-based system focused on skilled workers to be introduced. Overhauling the department’s culture while implementing one of the biggest policy shifts in recent times will be a significant ask."
2020-03-19T13:13:04Z,politics,Politics,Pressure to delay Brexit talks as coronavirus crisis grows,"The European Union has toughened its demands on fish in British waters as part of a post-Brexit trade deal, as the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, revealed he had coronavirus, fuelling doubts about the timetable for an agreement. Fishing is set to be one of the most bruising chapters of the EU-UK negotiations, with both sides seeking an agreement by 1 July, a deadline called into question by the coronavirus crisis. An EU legal text published on Wednesday evening revealed a tougher approach on fishing rights, compared with an earlier version. The new text sets the goal of “upholding … existing reciprocal conditions on access to waters and resources”, whereas the previous version set the bar at “defining clear and stable rules”. The changes – demanded by EU member states – underline that national governments are taking a harder line on fishing rights than the EU’s chief negotiator, who wants flexibility in the negotiating room. Member states, led by France, Belgium, Denmark and Ireland, are insisting on maintaining the status quo on access rights for their fishing fleets. The British government wants to tear up arrangements formalised decades ago so that it can increase its share of the catch in British waters. The two sides exchanged legal texts on Wednesday, before Barnier announced he had tested positive for the coronavirus, heaping further doubt on the timetable for a deal by the end of the year. “I am doing well and in good spirits. I am following all the necessary instructions, as is my team,” Barnier wrote on Twitter. “For all those affected already, and for all those currently in isolation, we will get through this together.” In a video message recorded in a book-lined room, he added: “Everyone among us has a role to win this collective battle, this war against the virus.” A UK government spokesperson said: “We send Michel Barnier our best wishes for his recovery.” Confirmation that the virus has spread to the highest levels of the EU negotiating team is bound to fuel calls for both sides to extend the transition period that ends on 31 December 2020. At his daily press conference on Wednesday, Boris Johnson denied reports he would seek an extension of the transition, saying it was “not a subject that is being regularly discussed”. The latest round of talks, due to take place in London this week, were cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak. The two sides have been unable to agree so far on other ways of talking. The UK has said both sides are considering “alternative ways to continue discussions”, such as video conferencing and conference calls. The European commission’s chief spokesman, Eric Mamer, said the negotiations would be carried forward. “We believe that there are ways to ensure that even in the current circumstances, negotiations can continue to take place.” The main focus, he said, was “textual analysis” of the legal documents exchanged by both sides. But online talks pose problems for the Brussels negotiators. Even the smallest discussions can include 10 to 20 people on each side, coming and going, during one three- or four-hour session. The European commission has asked all “non-critical” staff to work at home, a message reinforced by the Belgian government when a nationwide lockdown came into force on Wednesday. Meanwhile, civil servants across Whitehall are being deployed to work on the coronavirus. The next round, due to start on 6 April, is now in doubt, as the EU executive and all European governments turn their attention to fighting the coronavirus crisis. Terry Reintke, a German Green MEP, who helped to set up the European parliament’s EU-UK friendship group, told the Guardian it was “absolutely insane” to stick to the original timetable, which is meant to result in a wide-ranging deal on trade, fishing rights and security being agreed by the end of the year. “I don’t think it’s going to be possible. I really hope the British government and the British parliament will come to their senses.” She added that a deal was not just “people meeting in a room”, but time for parliamentary scrutiny, informed by experts. The European parliament, which has to approve the final deal, has drastically reduced its activity, with many MEPs unable to leave their home countries. Fabian Zuleeg, the head of the European Policy Centre, a Brussels thinktank, said not extending the transition was “reckless when faced with unprecedented crisis”. “Remote facilities cannot replace the multiple exchanges that take place during a negotiation round, let alone replicate the personal relationships that make a negotiation work,” he wrote. “That is particularly crucial in this case, where the timetable is already tight.” The British government has not revealed whether it intends to publish its draft legal text, which was sent to the EU team on Wednesday. “We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said. “We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them available more widely.”"
2020-03-19T11:01:21Z,politics,Politics,"UK 'must spend extra £22bn' to help workers facing layoffs, urges thinktank","The government should commit a further £22bn to support up to 1 million workers facing layoffs following the coronavirus outbreak, a thinktank has urged. As pressure mounts on the government to restore business and consumer confidence, the Resolution Foundation said a new work subsidy modelled on maternity pay should be available for workers threatened with redundancy. The statutory retention pay would allow firms to put staff on leave without making them redundant, supporting a million workers via a flat-rate subsidy to employers worth £151 per week for an initial six months.
The statutory pay retention scheme would cost around £3.6bn, the thinktank said, while a more ambitious earnings-linked scheme, in which staff are paid at least two-thirds of their typical salary – above the minimum £151 per week threshold – would cost around £8bn over six months. The Citizens Advice Bureau proposed an alternative “crisis minimum income” of at least £180 a week so everyone has enough money “to protect their own health and the health of others”. Adding to criticism that ministers have moved slowly to protect vulnerable workers from dramatic falls in income, the Conservative former business secretary Greg Clark joined the Labour former prime minister Gordon Brown in urging the government to act immediately to prevent mass job losses by allowing the taxpayer to subsidise companies’ wage bills. Meanwhile, 46 opposition MPs and peers wrote to Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak demanding “a basic income payment for all citizens to see them through this crisis”. Denmark, Ireland, Sweden and Germany are among the European countries that have already taken action to directly shore up workers’ incomes. Clark, who resigned as business secretary rather than serve under Johnson, raised an urgent question in the House of Commons warning the government that the £330bn loan scheme announced by Sunak as chancellor on Tuesday would not prevent firms from laying-off their staff. “These businesses have no idea when they would be able to pay back the debt that they would incur. It provides no reason to keep staff employed. In fact the reverse, because the smaller the wage bill, the less would have to be borrowed,” he said. Brown said Sunak must do “considerably more” by the weekend to protect people’s jobs. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “He says he’ll do more but the package should be out now to avoid redundancies being forced upon companies over the next day or two. Sunak announced an expansion of statutory sick pay in the budget on 11 March and a relaxation of benefit rules designed to help vulnerable workers. He has not ruled out adopting a broader package of income support but has said the mechanisms used by other European countries do not exist in the UK. As part of the package announced on Tuesday, the chancellor offered businesses in the hard-hit retail, leisure and hospitality sectors a year-long holiday from paying business rates, with smaller firms also eligible for a cash grant of up to £25,000. Sunak also announced cash grants of £10,000 for the UK’s 700,000 smallest companies and a three-month moratorium on mortgage payments for homeowners in difficulty due to the coronavirus. With the scale of the coronavirus pandemic – and the public health response to it – having escalated since the budget last week, the Resolution Foundation said the chancellor must “step up the scale of support for affected workers and rethink the approach to helping struggling firms”. The thinktank’s report says around 5 million workers are vulnerable to being laid off unless the government goes further. Without giving a forecast for the likely rise in unemployment, the report estimates in its modelling of the potential costs that between 500,000 and 1 million workers could be laid off.
It says fewer than one in 10 of those in the bottom half of earners say they can work from home, and those in the most at-risk sectors and occupations also have less to fall back on given that they are around 25% more likely than average to live in families with no savings. The report says a fresh approach is needed, including the extension of sick pay to 2 million low earners currently excluded and an increase in unemployment benefits and universal credit to £100 per week. It says a rise in unemployment is inevitable as some firms go bust and the self-employed lose work. “To strengthen the safety net that many families will rely on in the months ahead, the government should increase the generosity of jobseeker’s allowance, employment support allowance and the standard rate of universal credit. From April these benefits will pay just £74 a week to a single adult – and just £59 to those under 25) – when losing their jobs,” the report says. “This is the same as they were paying in the early 1990s, despite the economy growing by more than half since then. Increasing their value by around a third to £100 per week (for an adult aged 25 and over) would cost around £10bn a year. Going further to up-rate other means-tested working-age benefits by 10% would cost a further £3bn.”"
2020-03-18T20:42:40Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson will forever be defined by the coronavirus crisis,"Little more than six weeks ago, Boris Johnson was pictured jubilantly bashing a tiny gong to celebrate the fact he had “got Brexit done”. He began 2020 in the most powerful position any prime minister had enjoyed for more than a decade – with a comfortable Commons majority, a lame-duck Labour leader, and the luxury of a five-year term stretching ahead. He had grand plans for “levelling up” Britain, shaking up Whitehall and remaking the Tory party. And he carried his responsibilities lightly, taking a 10-day Caribbean break over Christmas with his partner.
It is now clear, though, that just as Theresa May’s premiership was broken by Brexit, and Gordon Brown’s defined by the financial crisis, Johnson will forever be remembered – for good or ill – as the coronavirus prime minister. And while Brown’s decade at the Treasury and dour demeanour made him the ideal leader for the banking crash, nothing in Johnson’s background or political makeup have prepared him for telling the British public to stay out of the pub. Temperamentally upbeat, with a strong appetite for risk, he is notoriously a (tongue in cheek) admirer of the mayor in Jaws – “a gigantic fish is eating all your constituents and he decides to keep the beaches open. OK, in that instance he was actually wrong. But in principle, we need more politicians like the mayor!” he (half-)joked, when he was running for City Hall.
Some observers, including in his own party, fret that this optimistic disposition – combined with a strong anti-authoritarian instinct – has slowed the government’s response to the virus, making Johnson and his team shy away from the most draconian interventions. The government maintains that every decision throughout the rapidly mounting crisis has been guided by the science – and argues that it is better to do “the right thing at the right time” than to be pressured into kneejerk overreaction. It also acknowledges that while saving lives is paramount, it has a responsibility to protect livelihoods and jobs too. Johnson is not much of an ideologue. Even before the coronavirus, his government’s first budget was planned to junk austerity, at least for public investment projects if not the threadbare welfare budget.
And Tuesday’s economic package underlined the fact he is perfectly willing to tear up Tory orthodoxy if that is what it takes to weather the storm – though help for businesses was noticeable faster in coming than for vulnerable households. But he has appeared to find it much harder to loosen his grip on another tenet of conservatism – personal liberty. He has so far been unable to muster either the dirigisme of Emmanuel Macron or the moral heft of Leo Varadkar when urging the public to do the right thing, and stay at home. Johnson dodged the question on Tuesday of whether his septuagenarian father was right to say he might “need” to go to the pub. And even on Wednesday, when asked whether it was “immoral” to ignore the government guidance, he stressed the importance of “liberty” as a British value, and said people would make their own decisions – before urging them to be “ruthless” in following the rules.
It appears to sit uneasily with Johnson to impose stringent restrictions on the public’s personal lives – so much so that he has at times appeared almost ambivalent about it: nudging or urging instead of ordering. But he knows it cannot last. He acknowledged on Wednesday that as the virus continued to spread the government might have to go “farther and faster”. Instead of the heroic mayor who held his nerve and let the bathers keep coming as the shark circled, he appears to have been cast in the role of the leader who shuts down London – not the one he thought he was auditioning for. As one shellshocked Downing Street insider put it this week: “Events, dear boy, events - I know what that means now.”"
2020-03-18T19:19:08Z,politics,Politics,"In a pandemic, the wrong economic policy can be fatal","Larry Elliott’s lucid analysis of the economic issues surrounding Covid-19 (This global recession will be prolonged, and policymakers know that, 16 March; With the Bank’s bullets spent, can the Treasury keep the economy on life support?, 17 March) does not emphasise some fundamentals enough. The irrefutable fact is that output – real national income – is falling, and thus the country as a whole will be worse off. The basic problem to be tackled is how to manage the distribution of that fall, and in particular how to protect poorer groups. Manipulating total demand, such as by printing money, will cause inflation and could make things much worse for those groups. (Amartya Sen, in his 1981 book Poverty and Famines, argues that such a policy caused famine in India in the 1940s.) Using income tax to redistribute real incomes is a possibility. In addition, ensuring the supply of basic essentials, especially food, should be a priority. For example, guaranteeing farmers higher prices, well in advance, should stimulate supply (creating money to do that is OK, so long as output is increased as a result). The entire economic situation is unprecedented, though it is a little like that of the 1970s and early 80s, when supply was also hit. In contrast, the 1930s and post-2007 were characterised by a fall in demand, and Keynesian policy was appropriate. John Levi Retired academic economist, Abingdon, Oxfordshire • Larry Elliott suggests that universal basic income is unlikely to be implemented due to big changes needed in the tax and benefits system. However, these are not normal times, and we need to act to support those who are self-employed, laid off and in the gig economy, and all others who are having financial difficulties due to coronavirus. It seems to be a fairly simple way of making sure everyone has an income, can be done quickly if the will is there, and avoids much of the confusion of subsidies, mortgage and rent holidays and other measures that he mentions. Terry Quinn Preston • When I first became an advocate for unconditional universal basic incomes (UBIs) almost 50 years ago, I little imagined the circumstances in which they would become widely canvassed for this country. It would especially have surprised me to see pictures of Pause the System demonstrators in hazmat suits sitting down outside Downing Street, demanding UBI. If it is adopted as an emergency measure, many people may become aware of its advantages, and support its permanent adoption. Bill Jordan Whimple, Devon • Nils Pratley observes that, as a result of measures to suppress the pandemic, a global recession is now almost certain (Chancellor’s £330bn package is big – but not big enough given the size of the threat, 18 March). We now know that austerity kills. What will be the cost in terms of human life of the economic downturn? Spending constraints on health and social care since 2010 are linked to an estimated 152,141 additional deaths, according to research published in BMJ Open. Will mortality from the self-inflicted economic downturn exceed the Covid-19 deaths averted? Dr John Doherty Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire • Health experts are correct in predicting that lives will be saved from death by coronavirus if social interaction is reduced, and that the greater the reduction, the more lives saved (Scientific modelling: Italy’s hospital data changed everything, 17 March). It is comparatively easy to calculate lives lost due to a virus; it will take longer to calculate the effects of a worldwide economic recession caused by the shutdown – the lives lost due to unemployment, despair, homelessness, famine, suicide, neglected non-virus illness, etc. I predict that a future analysis will show that more lives will be lost as a consequence of the current modelling than will be saved; and that it will have disproportionately targeted the health and wellbeing of the poorest and most vulnerable.

Wales was first to announce the measure, followed closely by Scotland and Northern Ireland, before the Prime Minister confirmed the move would be nationwide. Johnson said nurseries and private schools would also be asked to close, and exams would not take place in May and June. The death toll in the UK rose to 104, after NHS England confirmed a further 32 people had lost their lives after testing positive for Covid-19. The patients were aged between 59 and 94 years old and had underlying health conditions. Their deaths raised the total number in England to 99. The number of people to test positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 9am on Wednesday was 2,626, up from 1,950 - a rise of 676.

2020-03-18T16:46:33Z,politics,Politics,Pantomime clown Boris Johnson flounders as crisis deepens | John Crace,"The Labour benches had already long since stopped cheering on their leader at prime minister’s questions, but now the Tories have also fallen silent. This is politics in the time of coronavirus. No braying. No waving of order papers. No wild acclaim for the repetition of mindless soundbites. The silence of MPs breaking the habit of a lifetime and trying to treat one another with respect and leading by example. Not that there were many MPs. For what is normally a guaranteed full house, there were barely 100 members in the chamber, all of whom were trying to maintain a safe distance from one another. And on Tory faces there were growing flickers of concern. Choosing Boris Johnson as their leader suddenly wasn’t looking like such a good idea. Boris is a good-time party guy. The sort of man who can be the life and soul of the Olympics and be relied on for any upbeat bollocks about Brexit. But Boris just can’t do the serious stuff. He is levitas incarnate. A man with an unbearable lightness of being. At a time of national crisis, the country wants a man who is willing to put in the hard yards. Who can be bothered to read briefing papers longer than two sides of A4. What’s more, deep down, Boris knows he is floundering. That he is hopelessly out of his depth. Up till now he’s always got away with somehow coming up with the right words. The master of the glib. A catchphrase for every occasion. Now though, those same words are dying in his throat. They don’t even convince him, let alone the other members of the cabinet. Rishi Sunak and Michael Gove could barely look at him. Liz Truss was lost in a world of her own. But then she often is. The pantomime clown with the pantomime hair has morphed into a pantomime villain. Someone even children can identify as inherently untrustworthy. And it’s taking its toll. Over the last few weeks – since he first got round to taking the pandemic seriously – he has aged years. His eyes are red and puffy, his complexion pallid and the bags deepening into furrows. At night he weeps, though mostly for himself. Of all the gin joints in all of the towns in all of the world, why did he have to walk into this one? This may well have been Jeremy Corbyn’s last PMQs, if rumours that parliament might shut for ordinary business at the end of the week are true or self-isolation for the over-70s is brought in at the weekend. If it is, then at least he can say he went out on a high, for his questions struck just the right tone and manner. While promising to work with the government in doing whatever was required, he pointed to some abject failures in the government response. Why couldn’t statutory sick pay be raised to EU levels? Were families really meant to get by on £90 per week? What about those on zero-hours contracts? What about those who couldn’t pay the rent? And why wasn’t more being done to test NHS workers – as well as the rest of the population – and provide more vitally needed protective clothing and ventilators? Unusually, the Tory benches were just as keen – if not more so – to hear the answers. Because up till now most of Johnson’s public announcements have been somewhat on the vague side, and their constituents are just as concerned as Labour’s. Trying to convince the country that the UK’s science is miles ahead of the rest of the world’s science hadn’t been a spectacular success, and it’s often felt like the rest of the country has been streets ahead of the government in its preparations for coronavirus. Just suggesting that people might like not go to pubs too often is hardly groundbreaking advice. Even if it does help bail out the insurance industry. Important to have your priorities right. Here Boris unwisely felt himself to be on stronger ground. The government had been doing a brilliant job by employing the nudge economics of such superb super-forecasters as Dominic Cummings and Steve Hilton, who have so far managed to get just about every forecast wrong. The thing was, these geniuses had managed to subvert nudge theory into turning it on its head. Long live the weirdos and the misfits. The model the government was using was to do nothing and just wait until everyone introduced sensible panic measures of their own. Then once the public had done its job for it it, the government would then be nudged into turning it into official policy. Ideal for the Boris with No Clothes, who couldn’t face the responsibility of decision making. Every question was on the coronavirus and the longer the session progressed, the more Tories began to further self-isolate from Boris. His answers on protective wear, ventilators and widespread testing sounded borderline delusional. How can one man have done so little when NHS staff have been begging him to do more for weeks? The prime minister couldn’t even bring himself to contemplate a possible extension to the Brexit transition. Imagine it. When the country might be economically on its knees, we have a prime minister happy to bankrupt it completely just to keep the rightwing Brexiters on board. There were no answers on closures of schools either, despite several questions on them. Looks like the plan is to be nudged into doing it later after Scotland and Wales have taken the lead. It won’t be long before cities are in lockdown. A policy many people have already taken for themselves. Lions led by donkeys."
2020-03-18T13:41:13Z,politics,Politics,"UK coronavirus testing will increase to 25,000 a day, says Boris Johnson","The UK will ramp up testing for coronavirus infection to 25,000 tests a day and NHS frontline staff are a priority, Boris Johnson has told the House of Commons. Doctors and nurses working in hospitals have been calling for testing so that they can know whether they are infected with the virus and in danger of passing it on to patients. One junior doctor started an online petition that accumulated 700,000 signatures.
“We are prioritising NHS staff for the obvious reason that we want them to be able to look after everybody else with confidence that they are not transmitting the disease,” Johnson said during prime minister’s questions. “This country is far ahead of many other comparable countries in testing large numbers of people.”
He said the NHS was increasing its testing from 5,000 to 10,000 a day. In response to questions from the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who pointed out that the healthcare frontline workforce was far larger than that, Johnson went further. “We’re moving up to 25,000 a day,” he said. Last week NHS England said it would be increasing testing from 5,000 to 10,000 a day, but on Tuesday the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said 4,000 tests were being carried out daily.
On Thursday last week Johnson announced the start of the “delay” stage of the response, in which testing would be largely restricted to people ill in hospital. NHS staff were not on the list of groups who would be tested, and they were told to self-isolate if they had a consistent dry cough and fever. Many were alarmed by this, warning that if they became ill they could have infected other doctors and nurses who in turn might infect patients. The World Health Organization has consistently advised countries to test everyone suspected of infection and their contacts, saying this was key to China and South Korea having brought down their numbers of cases and deaths."
2020-03-18T12:10:35Z,politics,Politics,Labour MPs alarmed at Covid-19 laws being passed without vote,"Labour MPs have expressed concern at the possibility of sweeping emergency powers to tackle coronavirus being put into force for two years without a Commons vote, with some saying such measures should face regular review. The comments will place pressure on the Labour leadership over how to respond to emergency legislation, amid speculation that the party will allow it to pass in the Commons without any vote being held. The legislation had been expected to be tabled on Thursday, but is now believed to be due on Monday. The laws, some details of which were announced on Tuesday evening, include medical-related measures such as allowing recently retired or nearly qualified nurses, midwives or paramedics to work in the NHS, with protection given against negligence claims. Other proposals are broader, such as giving powers to police or immigration officers to detain people suspected of carrying the virus and “to take them to a suitable place to enable screening and assessment” for an unspecified period.
Other measures would allow ministers to ban gatherings or events and make it easier for people to be detained in mental hospitals, and for longer periods. The powers, which ministers say would be used only if necessary, would be put in place for two years, with no provision mentioned so far for them to be reviewed in the interim. Clive Lewis, the Norwich South MP and shadow Treasury minister, told the Guardian that the idea of the legislation being passed without a vote “does concern me a great deal – but so too does hundreds of fellow MPs heading through the lobbies together in close proximity”. MPs should be able to scrutinise legislation and vote remotely during the coronavirus crisis, Lewis said. “Hence, this situation should not mean a complete breakdown of our democracy, which is what seems to be in offer. Of course, there needs to be a balance and the executive given certain extra powers. But those powers need scrutiny, review and regular renewal.”
Chris Bryant, the Labour MP for Rhondda, tweeted: “I can tell you now, this is the greatest emergency we’ve faced for many years, but I’m not voting for draconian emergency measures that last two years unless they require regular renewal by parliament. The civil contingencies bill requires renewal every 28 days.” Another Labour MP said they did not mind the legislation being passed without a vote “in the circumstances, but I’m very uneasy about the lack of checks and balances and think the bill needs to be strengthened”. The Labour leadership is understood to have not yet made a decision on whether to seek a vote, and in the interim is pushing on the legislation to include safeguards such as the length of time powers will be in place, as well as an improved financial and social package for people affected by the virus. A party source said: “The approach we will adopt will ensure proper scrutiny of the government, ensure that the government is held to account but in a way which reflects the circumstances we are in.”"
2020-03-18T07:00:18Z,politics,Politics,Layla Moran criticises Lib Dems' general election strategy,"Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP competing to become the party’s next leader, has castigated its tactics at the last election, saying a pledge to revoke Brexit lost it the trust of voters, while Jo Swinson’s talk of becoming prime minister was not seen as credible. Moran said the Lib Dem’s national image was “broken” and the party had to reconnect with voters and examine what it stood for after Brexit, or else risk “bumping along with 10% support and 10 or 11 MPs for a number of years”. The Oxford West and Abingdon MP also said that whoever becomes the new Labour leader must end the “very tribal politics” between the parties and cooperate to the extent of electoral pacts. “I think we’re quite a way off from that right now,” said Moran, the party’s education spokeswoman, who announced her candidacy just over a week ago. “Nevertheless, I do think that Labour need to look themselves in the eye and decide if they want to win or not.” Her most pointed comment concerned the Lib Dems’ hugely disappointing election campaign, during which the then leader, Swinson, initially presented herself as a prime minister-in-waiting, only to lose her seat as the party slipped to 11 MPs. Moran – who stresses she takes her share of responsibility for the decisions – said the ambitious stance was initially justified, but should have been changed after the Brexit party stood down the bulk of its candidates in favour of the Conservatives. “Then, under the first past the post system it actually became not just unlikely, but frankly impossible that we were going to form a government, and that lost us credibility,” she said. Moran, who is travelling the country talking to Lib Dem activists and to voters about what went wrong, also criticised the leadership’s shift ahead of the party’s conference last autumn to a policy of revoking Brexit without a second referendum, albeit only in the unlikely situation of winning an absolute majority. There was at the time, she said, “a fear that Labour was going to roll its tanks on to our turf and we needed something to be distinctive”. But, she argued, the idea was pushed through the party without proper debate. “I’ve been talking to activists who say, yes, they were bounced into it, partly because the decision was made in rooms in Westminster with not enough dissenting voices before,” Moran said. “So by the time it went to conference, it felt like it was a confidence motion.” While the Lib Dems pride themselves on being a grassroots-led party, Moran said this was being lost: “I’m concerned, if you look at the parliamentary party makeup at the moment, we are going to be perceived as a party of the elite of London and the south-east. “And that absolutely is not what I want for our party, we need to be a party for the entire country. And so, yes, we absolutely need to change the way we make policy.”
The two biggest obstacles the party faced in December’s election, Moran said, remained the electoral system and potential voters’ distaste for Jeremy Corbyn. “But that doesn’t absolve us from our own responsibility for decisions that we took,” she said. Moran refused to say which of the three candidates to succeed Corbyn she would most like to work with, but said that whoever did take over would need to not just cooperate better with other parties and embrace electoral change. “They need to appreciate that unless they work with us to change the electoral system it’s possible that the Conservatives, particularly with the lack of strength of Labour in Scotland, are going to have a majority forever,” she said. “They need to get quite pragmatic about that, in my view.” The only other candidate to formally announce they are running for the Lib Dem leadership so far is Wera Hobhouse, the MP for Bath, although Ed Davey, who took over as interim leader after Swinson lost her seat, seems certain to do so as well. Daisy Cooper, who won St Albans for the party in December, is also considering joining the race. Nominations do not open until 1 May, with voting among members not completed before mid-July. Moran said a key issue was developing new policy priorities, saying she had asked voters what they knew about the Lib Dems: “Unfortunately, for many of them, the answer is nothing. With Brexit, they knew what we were against. But when you ask them, well, what are we for, they don’t have an answer.” Her three priorities would be to boost equality of opportunity via education, tackle the climate emergency, and work towards more collaborative politics. The Lib Dems, she said, still had a strong local base, with popular councillors. “It’s the national brand that’s broken. And in my view, that’s what needs to change.”"
2020-03-17T20:17:56Z,politics,Politics,Chancellor's £330bn coronavirus package is big – but not big enough,"Rishi Sunak last week called his £12bn package to buttress the economy amid the spread of coronavirus “temporary, timely and targeted”. He was applauded – for a day. The measures, which included £5bn for the NHS, quickly looked peashooter-sized when, in the current jargon of financial markets, a big bazooka was required. The chancellor’s headline policy definitely qualifies as big – £330bn of loans and loan guarantees for business hit by the coronavirus is equivalent to 15% of GDP. The UK has never seen anything like it, even if similar policies are already being launched across Europe. Some of last week’s budget measures were also scaled up. Business rates have been scrapped for a year for a large swathe of the economy, covering retailers, pubs, clubs, theatres and restaurants. Cash grants of up to £25,000 for small and medium-sized businesses in affected sectors have also been boosted. Sunak called it a £20bn handout, on top of the budget moves. Householders also get a three-month mortgage holiday if required.
Is it enough? Almost certainly not. Last week’s experience shows that the definition of “whatever it takes” shifts by the day. And Sunak, to be fair, hinted at more to come in coming days – specifically for airlines and airports and generally for employees and individuals. The latter may be the crucial part in establishing a sense of medium-term confidence in the economy. The US is publicly contemplating sending $1,000 cheques to millions of Americans, a policy that is close to being “helicopter money”. Sunak did not deny the UK could do the same. The technical work, one can assume, is being done in the Treasury. The £330bn loan package can also be viewed another way – as merely a large sticking-plaster. Loans can alleviate cashflow crises where companies are confident demand will return, but a loan is not a handout. Some employers may decide it’s better for them to shed staff or shut up shop, the behaviour Sunak is trying to discourage. The threat of mass redundancies looks large, with effects that could last years. The next logical step – highly expensive for the public purse – would be for the government to underwrite a chunk of companies’ payroll costs, an approach that has already been adopted by some Scandinavian countries and France. Supporting half of Britain’s wage bill would cost the government approximately £40bn a month, according to estimates by Close Brothers Asset Management, a funding firm. “This is the sort of protection that might be required to ensure that when we come out the other side, consumer demand returns to pre-crisis levels and the economy isn’t damaged beyond repair,” said Robert Alster, the group’s investment chief.
Adding £40bn a month to government spending would clearly bust current deficit projections but the deficit is not the worry. Bond markets show no alarm at the prospect of governments writing large cheques. The yield of 10-year UK government IOUs is just 0.5%. Indeed, a backlash from the bond market is more likely to occur if the government is judged to be spending too little to protect the economy, not too much. Economic orthodoxies, in other words, are being overturned, and we should not be surprised. A global recession is now almost certain to happen in 2020 and some economists are talking a potential hit to economy in the April to June quarter, covering the predicted peak of the virus, of 15%. Again, that is unheard of during peacetime. So the outpouring of war-like “whatever it takes” rhetoric is legitimate. The initial reaction from business groups was favourable, but don’t read too much into that. These policies were “first steps”, said Sunak, and they are usually the easiest to take."
2020-03-17T18:42:58Z,politics,Politics,Coronavirus UK: £330bn of business loans made available as PM says school closures 'under continuous review' – as it happened,"The government will guarantee Â£330bn of loans to businesses in an â€œunprecedentedâ€� package of financial support to shore-up the British economy as the coronavirus outbreak escalates. As Richard Partington reports, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said if more help was needed it would be provided, with a pledge to deliver â€œwhatever it takesâ€� to keep companies and people solvent. Saying the British state would need to intervene in the economy in ways that were unimaginable just weeks ago, the chancellor said he would also provide tax breaks and other measures worth Â£20bn to protect companies and households suffering amid the economic collapse triggered by the virus. Boris Johnson has likened the fight against coronavirus to a wartime enterprise. In his opening remarks at the press conference where Rishi Sunak announced the rescue package for business, he said: We must act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support our economy. Thatâ€™s the main purpose of this press conference this afternoon ... Yes this enemy can be deadly, but it is also beatable â€“ and we know how to beat it and we know that if as a country we follow the scientific advice that is now being given we know that we will beat it. And however tough the months ahead we have the resolve and the resources to win the fight. And, to repeat, this government will do whatever it takes. Johnson has hinted that the government is moving closer to announcing the closure of schools. (See 5.48pm.) Earlier the largest teaching union, the National Education Union, called for schools to be shut. (See 11.50am.) Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has said the government is advising against all non-urgent travel abroad for the next 30 days. (See 12.44pm.) Sir Patrick Vallance, the governmentâ€™s chief scientific adviser, has said that the restrictions on social contact announced yesterday will be in place for months. (See 2.47pm.) When it was put to him that they could last 18 months, he said he did not know - but he did not reject the possibility outright. Thatâ€™s all from this blog for tonight. But there will be more coverage on our general coronavirus outbreak live blog all evening. You can read it here."
2020-03-17T17:09:45Z,politics,Politics,'We can’t afford to shut': PM's Covid-19 advice leaves pubs and shops in limbo,"A day after Boris Johnson strongly advised people to avoid pubs, clubs and theatres as part of a dramatic escalation of measures to curb the spread of coronavirus, the Guardian visited venues in three parts of the country – Rochdale, Wareham and London – to assess how closely the government’s advice was being followed and found many publicans and their customers in a defiant mood. Rochdale, Greater Manchester Opposite Rochdale’s Gothic town hall, the doors of the town’s busiest and best-known pub, the Flying Horse Hotel, were defiantly open. “We will stay open until the minute they tell us we have to shut,” said its owner, Ben Boothman, 38, surveying the smattering of drinkers sat around the oak bar. Boothman announced in a stirring Facebook post on Tuesday that the pub would continue serving punters as it had done “for the last 330 years”. The pub had endured “some of humanity’s biggest threats”, he wrote. “Smallpox, Spanish flu, six recessions, two world wars, the rise and fall of an empire, the start and end to our involvement in Europe, Napoleon, Hitler and Mr Blobby.” Yet it is coronavirus – a disease that emerged only four months ago – that poses the biggest threat to its existence. Boothman owns six pubs and restaurants in Rochdale, employing 100 people and paying £20,000 a week in wages. The effect of Boris Johnson’s press conference on Monday night was immediate and dramatic. “It probably took £15,000 off us – that one announcement,” he said.
The Flying Horse would usually serve 40 meals on a Monday night. It served only three after the prime minister’s speech. There were a few more drinkers than usual – “That’s northern defiance for you,” he said – but many of the regulars stayed away on Tuesday. Worse, the coronavirus is so novel that Boothman is not covered by his insurers. “At the minute we’re just haemorrhaging money,” he said. The government’s advice for people to stay away – but allowing them to remain open – presented pubs with the “worst case scenario”, he said. “I will never voluntarily shut the doors and lay my staff off. The government needs to tell us to do it but they don’t have the balls. It’s a shitshow, but you can get through a shitshow with a bit of guidance.”
Lunchtime punters were similarly defiant. “Why would you tell people not to go there but leave the pubs open? It’s a bit silly. I think the prime minister’s a bit of a divvy,” said Melissa Parker, 28, a student who popped into the Flying Horse for a meal after shopping in the town centre. “I just think if the pubs are open then I will be in them – until it’s on lockdown.” Boothman has offered free rooms in the hotel above his pub for people worried about potentially giving the virus to loved ones at home. The pub will also offer deliveries via JustEat later this week. Even then, he said, the situation is dire across the town. “Takings yesterday were frightening. Frightening,” he said. JH Wareham, Dorset Drinking buddies Frank Tranter, 80, and Julian Thomas, 72, were joking about the idea of self-isolation as they nursed pints of beer at the bar of the Duke of Wellington in Wareham, Dorset. “If and when the government says that we absolutely can’t go out, I’ll think seriously about it,” said Tranter. “Until then we’re going to do our self-isolating right here.” Thomas agreed. “It’s important for locals like us to keep pubs going. If we don’t come, places like this will go bust. We are keeping a metre apart, though.”
Outside the pub the staff have set up a sign reading: “Alcohol kills the virus.” Adrian Hole, the chef/manager, was busy frying up fish and chip lunches (£4.95 on a Tuesday). “It’s been as busy as ever,” he said. “We’re being careful not to over-order but we have to keep on. We’re just a small free house. We can’t afford to shut.” James Warren, the owner of the Salt Pig farm shop and cafe on North Street, said breakfast had been quiet but it had picked up for lunchtime. “It’s been a very difficult time – a long winter, rainy weather, Brexit, the general election. And then we’ve got this.” Warren has concerns, such as whether 26 weddings he is due to cater through the spring and summer will be cancelled. But he is also looking for the possible bright side. “We have lots of second-home owners here. If people leave London to come to the country, we may do well,” he said.
One of his regulars, David Burbidge, 75, was tucking into a pulled pork Purbeck pasty. “I wanted to come out and support this place,” he said. “I feel fine and don’t think I need to stay at home.” Almost every shop, cafe and restaurant remained open in Wareham. The library was busy with elderly people picking up the free paper the Swanage and Wareham Advertiser. The tourist information office said people were out and about going for walks. The nail bar was doing reasonable business. A community cafe, attached to a church, was one of the few places that had closed. A notice outside read: “Out of responsibility for our volunteers and customers, we have decided to close.”
Mother and son Jane Spencer and Andrew Welch, who run the Anglebury guesthouse, bar and restaurant, were gloomier than most. They also remain open but worked out that they have already lost more than £6,000 in cancelled guesthouse bookings. “We’re caught between the devil and the deep blue sea,” said Welch. “If we close we commit business suicide. If we stay open we could be risking our health.” Spencer criticised the government’s handling of the crisis. “We have full insurance, including for business interruption, but if the government doesn’t tell us we have to close then we won’t get it.” They are already considering laying off staff. “We’ve been going 20 years and the last 18 months have been our best,” said Spencer. “But we don’t know what we’re going to do now. It’s potentially disastrous.” SM Fleet Street, London On Fleet Street, business at the oldest Irish pub in London was struggling. Steven Rowlands, who has been the landlord of The Tipperary for more than 15 years, said he stands to lose £10,000 in one day as St Patrick’s Day custom evaporated. Every year the pub opens early (10.30am) to accommodate revellers. He should have already served between 60-70 people, as “everybody comes here”; but by noon he had served only four – including one punter who was drinking through a straw while wearing a surgical mask. The upstairs restaurant had seen all 35 of its bookings swiftly cancelled on Monday night as public fears about going to pubs set in following the prime minister’s statement.
Down in the cellar, Rowlands gestured towards 25-30 barrels, full of Guinness, that would, on a typical St Paddy’s Day, be close to running dry by now. “By 4pm I’d usually be putting in an order for more Guinness – not this year. There are 88 pints to a barrel, so here I’m sitting on over 2,500 pints of Guinness alone, let alone the beer, lager and everything else I’ve got to sell.”
He had expected a downturn and had not ordered the seafood bar the pub would usually have at this time of year. By 2pm things had picked up somewhat, but nowhere near enough – Rowlands said the tills were two-thirds down on what they should be. “You usually can’t fit through the door in here, we’d have people out drinking on the street. Not this year.” A great supporter of Boris Johnson, Rowlands criticised the lack of clarity from the government. “Either you do it and close everything, or you don’t. Right now we have to get on with it, the world can’t stop turning, I have no choice at the moment but to stay open. If I shut, I still have rent, bills and staff to pay. So I can’t shut unless the government says I have to.
“I’m looking to be down £12,000-15,000 since last Friday afternoon. We need help – whether it’s with rent, council tax, business rates, somebody needs to compensate us if we’re told to shut because I’m still liable to pay the bills.” Also at the bar was Brian Porter, 73, who used to run the Tipperary. He added that the government needed to be clear about what pubs were supposed to do. “These businesses already operating on small margins – if we take it upon ourselves to close, what do we do about all these bills? Right now, we’re in limbo. We can only close if we’re told to close.” LC Oxford Street, London One of the busiest shopping districts in the country had an air of devastation. Landmark stores such as Nike, Apple and Microsoft were closed, the Scribbles card shop had one of its worst days despite an imminent Mother’s Day, while popular chains such as Pret a Manger had already shortened their opening hours. Francesca Toma, manager at Pret’s store in Hanover Square, wondered if they could remain open in the longer term as a row of staff dealt with a trickle of customers. “Normally this would be completely full, there would be nine queues of people out the door, you couldn’t be able to see the fridges,” she said.
Kintan Japanese restaurant on Princes Street was completely empty. “Normally we would have 120 people here, today we have zero,” said manager Carmelo Giaconia. “I have sent six people home already and if it continues like this more or less the same tonight. When Boris Johnson said people should avoid restaurants what does that mean? If you go to the restaurant, it’s your problem? Everyone here cares about the health of customers, we sanitise, but our leader doesn’t seem to care about people who pay taxes and I pay a lot of taxes,” he added. At the Shakespeares Head in Carnaby Street, only four people were lured in by the St Patrick’s Day promotion. Even the Salvation Army, on which homeless people rely for food, had closed but was expected to provide takeaway food.
Others were taking the health of people very seriously – Tilly, 44, had run 10km in from Muswell Hill to avoid mingling with the public as she wanted to protect herself from a potential infection ahead of a meeting with some vulnerable people. LOC"
2020-03-17T00:01:40Z,politics,Politics,"Online political ads should be labelled, says Law Commission","Online political adverts should be labelled or “imprinted” to show who is paying for them, according to the Law Commission, which warns that there is a “very real risk of the electoral process losing credibility”. Presiding officers should also have the power to cancel polls in the event of major terror attacks as well as severe weather such as widespread flooding or other disruptive events, the commission has proposed in a series of measures to change the Victorian-era laws that govern how democracy operates in the UK. The report, produced in the aftermath of the 2016 EU referendum and the cancelled 2014 Tower Hamlets mayoral election, will be handed to the Cabinet Office and the devolved Scottish government for approval. It was completed before the UK government announced last week the postponement of local elections and the mayoral contest in London.
The Law Commission’s review is aimed at modernising ballot rules and bringing them together in a single, consistent legislative framework. Other changes proposed include simplifying the nomination process. Some proposed changes are in response to digital developments. In 2017, 42.8% of the total reported campaign advertising spend was online. Much of it was delivered using micro-targeting techniques, which blur the previous distinction between national and constituency electoral expenditure, the commission acknowledges. “Without knowing who is responsible for material, it is difficult to tell when an offence has been committed, or to enforce the campaign expenditure rules,” it notes. A system requiring online adverts to carry “digital imprints” would help. “Being able to track the origin of campaign material is also important for voters, as it enables them to assess its credibility.” Currently, printed campaign material must be labelled, or “imprinted”, with the name of whoever publishes it and with certain other information. Failure to do so is a criminal offence. Nicholas Paines QC, the public law commissioner at the Law Commission of England and Wales, said: “Elections are fundamental to democracy yet the laws governing them are no longer fit for purpose. If left as they are, there is a very real risk of the electoral process losing credibility, which could be catastrophic. “Our reforms will simplify, modernise and rationalise the law. This will make it easier to amend legislation so elections are able to overcome future challenges, and help to maintain confidence in the electoral system.” Lady Paton, the chair of the Scottish Law Commission, said: “For both Scotland and the wider UK, it’s vital that the law on elections is easy to administer, accessible and user-friendly. These reforms will achieve this, ensuring elections work and are fit for the 21st century.” The report has been published jointly by the two commissions which review outdated legislation. UK electoral law is currently spread across 25 statutes and 30 sets of regulations, many dating back to the 19th century. A significant proportion of them are found in the Representation of the People 1983 Act. When changes were last made to to allow those queuing at the close of polls to cast their vote, or example, alterations had to be made to 10 distinct pieces of legislation. The main changes proposed include: • Expanding the conditions under which polls can be suspended. Voting can currently only be stopped by a presiding officer in response to rioting, open violence or the death of a candidate. The Law Commission recommends allowing for any incident where a significant portion of electors are affected and unable to vote including, for example, flooding, adverse weather or an act of terrorism. • Introducing a single set of nomination papers for candidates, replacing the existing, confusing mixture of forms and authorisations. UK parliamentary nominations at present involves up to seven different pieces of paper: some are sent by the party nominating officer, some by the candidate; some must be delivered by hand, others can be delivered by post. • Requiring “digital imprints” for online campaign material and for social media advertisements. They would include information on who has paid for the advert, as is the case for traditional election leaflets and advertisements. • Reforming how election results can be challenged. The new proposals would give courts the power to “weed out ill-founded claims that waste court time”. • Simplifying the offence of bribery for anyone acting with an intention to procure or prevent the casting of a vote at an election. The ancient offence of “treating” – providing meat, drink or provisions to influence voters’ behaviour – should be abolished. • Enabling returning officers to reject nominations that use a candidate’s name designed to confuse or mislead electors. • Introducing sentences of up to 10 years in prison for serious electoral fraud. Prosecutors currently have to resort to the offence of conspiracy to defraud to impose such prison terms. Minister for the Constitution and Devolution Chloe Smith said: “This Government is committed to updating electoral law and delivering a democracy that works for all in the 21st century. I am grateful for the Law Commissions’ report and will be considering their recommendations carefully.” The cabinet office said that the government has already committed to introducing a requirement for inserting ‘imprints’ in digital election material."
2020-03-16T19:48:41Z,politics,Politics,PM finally defers to experts as he deflects tricky Covid questions | Jonathan Freedland,"This was a critical moment for Boris Johnson. He went into Monday’s Downing Street press conference – set to be a daily occurrence from now on – with a question mark hovering over his ability to lead the country through a crisis. At his last appearance at the podium, on Thursday, he had seemed anxious, if not overwhelmed, by the scale of the problem engulfing the country and, therefore, his premiership. Since then, there had been confusion and worse – a weekend of tangled messaging over “herd immunity” and rising bafflement as to why Britain seemed to be out of step with the rest of the world in enforcing social distancing, along with anger that the UK is testing for coronavirus so much less thoroughly than other countries.
The prime minister did not exactly sweep away those concerns as he addressed the press – there were still gaps and contradictions in his message – but he probably did just enough to persuade the doubters that he and the government have a plan, and thereby buy himself more time and patience from a worried public. Those who had hoped for a Napoleonic edict, unambiguously shutting down pubs, cafes and theatres, were disappointed because Johnson instead announced something foreign commentators instantly branded typically British: a slightly passive-aggressive set of advisory messages, starting with the recommendation that people ought to “avoid” pubs and bars, rather than simply ordering them to shut. In the same spirit, there was to be no legally enforced curfew on the elderly or the sick, but a period of “shielding” of the most vulnerable that would last 12 weeks. The advice was for people to work from home “where they possibly can” and keep “unnecessary” travel to a minimum, but both left some wiggle room. Mass gatherings would not be banned, exactly, but the emergency services would no longer support them. Strictly speaking, such events could still go ahead but, Johnson explained: “We are moving emphatically away from them.” It was the language of “should” rather than “must”. Asked why the PM hadn’t used the full might of his powers, Johnson replied: “We’re a mature, grown-up liberal democracy.” Others speculated that he was thinking about an insurance industry that would be liable for big bills if businesses could say they were shut by government diktat. In normal times, Johnson might have come under fire from those who believe the government needs to get a firmer grip, opting for the compulsory over the voluntary and relying rather less on citizens’ sense of civic responsibility. But Johnson had his two wingmen at his side, the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser and they once again served as his protective shield. When tough questions came – if close social contact in large groups is now so perilous, why on Earth are schools still open? Why aren’t we testing more? – Johnson could, as he put it, defer to the experts, asking the two men flanking him to answer. Of course, it’s such a reversal of the populist, anti-expert rhetoric of the 2016 referendum that propelled Johnson to Downing Street, but few will mind that too much. Given the alternative – a prime minister who doesn’t defer to the scientists – most Britons are likely to swallow the contradiction with relief. For Johnson, this new, enforced persona is utterly at odds with the “Boris” he meticulously constructed over three decades. He used to rely on gags and bluster; now he depends on Sir Patrick Vallance and Prof Chris Whitty. His brand was meant to be cheery optimism; now he has to stand before the public and demand a degree of personal sacrifice unseen since 1945, warning of a period of misery that could last many months. Occasionally the “Boris” of old tried to break through. “We need to flatten the curve, squash the sombrero,” he said, with the faintest hint of a smile. He tried to be upbeat in promising the country was making “huge strides” in getting enough ventilators, and allowed himself to hold out the prospect of eventual “remedies – even a vaccine”. But there are few smiles to be had now. These are gravely serious times, with the country led by a man it’s not yet sure is serious enough for the task."
2020-03-16T19:32:15Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson warns Britons to avoid non-essential contact as Covid-19 death toll rises – as it happened,"Boris Johnson has unveiled a series of hugely stringent new restrictions to slow what he said was the now-rapid spread of coronavirus in the UK, including a 14-day isolation for all households with symptoms, a warning against â€œnon-essentialâ€� contact, including trips to pubs and clubs, and an end to all mass gatherings. See 6.15pm for a summary of Johnsonâ€™s unprecedented announcement. The UK government has promised to ramp up testing of suspected coronavirus cases, although the measures still fall significantly short of the levels called for by the World Health Organization (WHO). Major British manufacturers have been sent blueprints showing them how to make up to 20,000 ventilators to treat coronavirus patients in the event of an surge in cases. The Old Vic, The Institute of Contemporary Arts and the National Gallery are the latest British cultural institutions to close or postpone shows as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the UKâ€™s arts and culture sector spreads. World leaders at a G7 video summit told Donald Trump that medical firms must share and coordinate research on coronavirus vaccines rather than provide products exclusively to one country.

2020-03-16T11:00:24Z,politics,Politics,‘I could be the first and the last’: Kizzy Gardiner on life as the UK’s only locum MP,"Not long ago, a heavily pregnant woman walked into Kizzy Gardiner’s office in desperation. She was homeless, with nowhere to sleep that night, and had approached her local MP’s staff because she didn’t know where else to go. “That was one of those things where you’re like: ‘I’m going to have to put her in my spare room,’” says Gardiner, the former head of fundraising for an international development charity. But after an afternoon hitting the phones, eventually the team found her somewhere to stay. “The most rewarding bit is when you get those wins for people – when we get to use the power of the MP’s office to do something positive.” It is stories like this that not only keep MPs awake in the small hours, but also make it exceptionally hard for them to take time off when they’re pregnant themselves. Who would want cases like this slipping through the cracks? Yet what Gardiner is doing has the potential to change all that. She is parliament’s first ever maternity locum, hired only after a considerable bureaucratic struggle to cover the Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy’s constituency work while Creasy takes time off with her newborn daughter, Hettie. Unsurprisingly, Gardiner is very aware of how much it matters to make this work. “It’s great that my role exists, but it’s been a huge battle and there’s no commitment to doing it again,” she says, sipping tea in Creasy’s Walthamstow office. “I could be the first and the last.” When she first found out Creasy was looking for a locum, she almost didn’t apply. “I vaguely thought about putting an application in but then I was like: ‘Oh no, what are the chances? She’ll know somebody,’” says Gardiner, 35. She lives in Walthamstow and is a local party member but hadn’t met Creasy before. She let herself be talked into it by friends, she says, partly because “it had never been done before. So I thought, ‘I’m probably not going to be definitely not the right person, because who knows what that person is?’” Besides, she liked the description of the job as “rooted in Walthamstow, not in Westminster”. Gardiner can’t vote or speak on Creasy’s behalf in parliament, since she is not elected, although she does meet other MPs to discuss constituency cases in which they have a common interest and she lobbies ministers on behalf of constituents. (Creasy’s voting duties in the Commons are covered by the Labour MP Peter Kyle, who exercises a proxy vote on her behalf.) Her main role is as the public face of the MP in her east London patch, doing everything from running weekly surgeries to keeping Creasy’s national political campaigns ticking over on issues such as domestic violence. She regularly finds herself making up the rules as she goes along: “Something that I’ve learned is about just stepping into spaces and waiting for the challenge, especially in a role like this where it’s brand new. People don’t know what it means, so you have to just go for it. If people don’t want you to be there, you will find out soon enough.” Nobody has yet refused to deal with her because she isn’t the “real” MP, she says. “I think some people are shocked, but people handle it very differently.” Most constituents take it in their stride once they realise she can still help them: “A lot of it is in the proof of doing the work.” She works full-time hours, a rough indication of how hard Creasy must have pushed heself when she was doing parliamentary and political work on top of casework. The big surprise has been the range of problems on which Gardiner is expected to be an instant expert. “The breadth of stuff people come in with is mind-boggling. We get a lot of ‘Can you fix my bins?’ or ‘Can you make sure there’s speed bumps in my road because it’s dangerous?’, and we get a lot of complaints about antisocial behaviour.” Strictly speaking, many of these are questions for local councillors, not MPs, but Gardiner says it is often about advocating for people who don’t feel they have got anywhere with the council. And then there are the deeper problems: “We get a lot of housing issues, we get a lot of immigration issues. Mostly people will come to us when they feel they hit a brick wall.” Gardiner, who has a four-year-old daughter, job-shared in her previous role and thinks that experience of working alongside someone else helps with a delicate balancing act, poised somewhere between trying to second-guess what Creasy would be doing if she was here and simply being herself. “I’m definitely trying to follow the lead that Stella has set because ultimately it’s her seat, her job, her community that I’m filling in for. But I also bring my own experience.” She and Creasy confer regularly by text and WhatsApp, keeping each other up to date: Gardiner may need to know how Creasy is using her proxy vote on upcoming legislation so that she can explain to constituents, and in return feeds back things she picks up that might influence Creasy’s decisions. Might more permanent job-sharing one day be a viable option for MPs, with the role split between one person in the constituency and one in Westminster? “I think it could be.”
When I speak to a clearly thrilled Creasy by phone, with baby Hettie squawking happily in the background, she says she knew the arrangement was working when Gardiner told her about the homeless pregnant woman. “I have to be able to trust that Kizzy’s going to make the right choices, and when she told me about that, I thought: ‘That’s exactly why I picked you – that’s what I would have done,’” she says. “Kizzy doesn’t pretend to be me – she’s Kizzy, but she’s doing that role.” Having suffered a string of miscarriages before having her daughter, Creasy is clearly personally grateful to Gardiner for the time she now has with her baby. But she is also grateful on behalf of her constituents. “The thought of having fought for so long to get pregnant, and all the pain and misery that goes with that, and either not being able to spend some time with her or being worried because we all care about our constituents … We’ve got a knife crime epidemic in my constituency right now; I didn’t want to say: ‘Right, for six months you’re on your own.’ I spoke to colleagues from other political parties [about maternity leave] and one was describing hiding and hoping her constituents didn’t notice. That’s not feasible in Walthamstow.” None of it has been plain sailing, however. New parents in parliament have had the right to a proxy vote, meaning they needn’t physically walk through the lobbies to express a view on legislation, since last year (although it came only after widespread public indignation at the sight of the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq voting in a wheelchair on the day she was supposed to be giving birth). But until now, there has been no such cover for constituency work, meaning Siddiq was straight back to doing casework three days after a C-section. Creasy spent months locked in a pitched battle with the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), the parliamentary agency responsible for MPs’ expenses including staff costs. It agreed to pay for maternity cover in her constituency only after she went public about the miscarriages she had suffered and her fear of losing this baby too. It was, to put it mildly, a lonely battle. While Theresa May wrote to Ipsa from Downing Street in support of her claim, all Creasy will say of the response from the senior reaches of her own party is: “The Labour party was the most sceptical and resistant. That was a surprise to me, to say the least.” The final twist in tale is that three weeks before she was due to hand over to Gardiner, Boris Johnson called a snap general election. Since it was Stella Creasy the people of Walthamstow were choosing whether or not to elect, she had no choice but to postpone her maternity leave and hit the campaign trail at eight months pregnant. She was back out chasing votes three days after giving birth and delivered her acceptance speech on election night with the baby in a sling. There are still things Creasy can’t delegate even now – only an MP can table an amendment to legislation in the Commons, which helps explain why last week Creasy was chairing a parliamentary seminar on moves to make misogyny a hate crime – and she has chosen to make occasional TV appearances and attend some events locally. She sees these as her equivalent of the “keeping in touch” days available to women on conventional maternity leave. Having been initially put off politics by dabbling in the student version of it, which she remembers as “a lot of sitting around and arguing about stuff, not a lot of doing”, Gardiner agrees that covering maternity leave could be the ideal test run for women considering a political career in their own right. But she still isn’t sure whether she wants to try for her own seat after Creasy returns in June. “It’s a big role and there’s a lot for me to learn … Would I want to do it again? I don’t know, is the honest answer. At the moment, I’m just focusing on trying to do this job well.” She admits to having thought hard about the implications for her family of covering for an MP in the current climate of threats against politicians (Creasy herself has faced attempts to deselect her by hard-left activists, death threats from the far right and an intimidating campaign locally by anti-abortion activists protesting against her successful bid to establish abortion rights for women in Northern Ireland). Eventually, Gardiner decided it was worth it, knowing that when the six months are over “I could always shut down Twitter and run away”, but it is clear she finds what she calls “the public ownership thing” the most testing part of the job. So would she be a locum again? When Boris Johnson announced that his fiancee Carrie Symonds was expecting a baby this summer, Gardiner tweeted tongue-in-cheek that she was happy to cover if needed. But beneath the joke was a serious point: it is not only female MPs who could benefit from cover for parental leave or even serious illness, and both she and Creasy are keen this shouldn’t be a one-off. “I don’t know why people aren’t pushing harder for it,” says Gardiner, who is worried that female politicians still daren’t risk being seen to need help. “There are other countries that do this successfully; we’re trialling it at the moment and it’s working well.” She is keeping notes on what she has learned in case they are useful to anyone else in future, but says so far the parliamentary authorities haven’t shown much interest. Any MP seeking a similar arrangement will need to apply all over again to Ipsa, with no guarantee of acceptance. While she still finds it “unreal” that in 2020 politicians have no automatic right to maternity leave, it surprises Gardiner less now that she has seen the system up close. “When you walk around Westminster it’s just steeped in history; everything is designed for hundreds of years ago. You look at the pictures and it’s all old white men. It just makes you realise why it’s not at the forefront of everybody’s minds.” Perhaps the arrival of a new baby in Downing Street could be more of a tipping point than we think."
2020-03-15T22:30:08Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson to hold daily coronavirus press briefings,"Boris Johnson will seek to shore up public confidence in the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic on Monday by holding the first of what are intended to be daily ministerial press conferences on the crisis. The prime minister, who had been under growing pressure to start holding daily briefings amid criticism of his response to Covid-19 and the media strategy used to explain it, will personally chair many of the daily briefings, which No 10 says will continue “as long as necessary”. On Monday afternoon he will also chair another Cobra meeting, where ministers will discuss measures that would dramatically escalate the steps being taken by the UK to tackle the virus. They are expected to discuss a planned ban on mass gatherings, proposals to ask whole households to stay at home when someone falls ill and the move, expected within weeks, to ask the over-70s to stay at home for up to four months. They are also due to discuss the modelling used by the government to determine its overall strategy, which is due to be published soon. The daily briefings, which are intended to focus on informing the public “on how to protect themselves”, will also routinely feature Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, its chief scientific adviser. Johnson, who for most of his time in office has shown little enthusiasm for exposing himself to media scrutiny, announced the plan after the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said daily briefings were needed to ensure people got “much clearer guidance” on what the government was doing and why. All three Labour leadership candidates and Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had also demanded greater clarity. On Monday, Johnson is also due to hold a conference call with British manufacturers, who will be urged to switch production to start making the ventilators required by hospitals, and he will participate in a conference call with fellow G7 leaders in which he will be calling for global action to fight the disease and its economic impact.
Calls for a daily ministerial press conference intensified over the weekend, following at least three incidents of Whitehall giving out contradictory messages over coronavirus, with the uncertainty compounded by the fact that some key reporting was based on unattributable sources.
On Friday morning Vallance gave an interview defending the government’s decision not to ban large sporting events – only for No 10 to brief that evening that a ban would soon be implemented. In his interview Vallance also spoke about the potential advantage of the UK acquiring some element of herd immunity to coronavirus. But his comments triggered a fierce backlash on social media, with people claiming it amounted to evidence that the government was happy for large numbers of people to get coronavirus. On Sunday Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had to distance himself from Vallance, saying “herd immunity is not our goal or policy”.
The health secretary then found himself being contradicted by officials in Scotland. He said the government would soon ask the over-70s to “stay self-isolated” at home for four months, but his use of the term “self-isolate” was taken by some to mean the elderly would be told not just to minimise contact with others, but to avoid it altogether. Although Johnson’s decision to front many of the daily press conferences himself will be seen as testimony to the seriousness with which he is approaching the crisis, former Labour health secretary Andy Burnham, now mayor of Greater Manchester, said it would be better for the chief medical officer to chair the daily government briefings. Burnham added that this was what happened when the government was handling swine flu during his time in office and that everything became “a bit calmer” when the official briefings were no longer entangled with politics. Although a poll at the weekend suggests 53% of voters trust the government to deal with the pandemic, ministers have come under pressure to explain why the UK is not matching some of the tougher measures being taken in other European countries, where bars, restaurants and non-essential shops have been closed, as well as schools. In an interview on Sunday, Hancock rejected the claim that the UK measures were out of step with what was happening elsewhere. “We are similar to many countries,” he claimed. “For instance, we are very similar to the approach being taken in Germany and Australia and others. “It is about making sure you do the right thing at the right time. We are prepared to take, if we need to, all the sorts of measures [discussed], but we will do it based on the science.” On Monday the Department for Work and Pensions will also be announcing that face-to-face assessments for people claiming sickness and disability benefits will be suspended for three months. Instead claimants will be assessed by phone or paper-based methods."
2020-03-15T17:50:22Z,politics,Politics,Johnson urged to launch daily coronavirus press briefings,"Boris Johnson has been urged to start holding daily coronavirus press briefings as criticism of the UK government’s media handling of the crisis grows. All three Labour leadership candidates demanded greater clarity, and Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, also spoke out as her officials sought to clarify a warning from Matt Hancock, the health secretary, about the over-70s having to self-isolate at home for up to four months. The opposition parties have largely been supportive of the government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, but there have been at least three incidents of Whitehall giving out contradictory messages, with the uncertainty compounded by the fact that some key reporting has been based on unattributable sources. Keir Starmer, the Labour leadership race frontrunner, said that over the last 48 hours ministers had been “failing in their responsibilities to provide consistent and transparent public health advice” and that allowing the public to learn about significant changes in policy through anonymous briefings was “irresponsible”. “It’s time the government commits to a daily press conference about its handling of coronavirus. This must be hosted by a government minister or the prime minister himself, with experts and advisers available to answer questions as appropriate,” Starmer said.
Rebecca Long-Bailey also called for daily briefings to be broadcast, and Lisa Nandy said the government had to publish much better information because the last 48 hours had been “a real shambles”. Nandy singled out as an example Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, giving an interview on Friday morning defending the decision not to ban large sporting events only for No 10 to brief that evening that a ban would soon be implemented. In his interview, Vallance also spoke about the potential advantage of the UK acquiring some element of “herd immunity” to coronavirus, echoing an argument used by another adviser and the head of government’s behavioural insights team, Dr David Halpern, earlier in the week.
Vallance’s comments triggered a fierce backlash on social media, with people claiming it amounted to evidence that the government was happy for large numbers of people to get coronavirus. On Sunday, Hancock had to distance himself from Vallance, saying “herd immunity is not our goal or policy”. The health secretary then found himself being contradicted by officials in Scotland. He said the government would soon ask the over-70s to “stay self-isolated” at home for four months, but his use of the term “self-isolate” was taken by some to mean the elderly would be told not just to minimise contact with others, but to avoid it altogether. Catherine Calderwood, Scotland’s chief medical officer, told the BBC that what was being proposed for elderly people was “reducing social contact, rather than self-isolating” and that it was “scaremongering” to suggest they would be told to sit “home alone”. When Jason Leitch, the Scottish government’s national clinical director, posted a message on Twitter making the same point, Sturgeon commended him for providing “important clarity”. Sturgeon went on to add in another tweet: “Giving clear and consistent information to public at the right time on coronavirus is vital. Governments’ media strategies must reflect the importance of that.”"
2020-03-15T15:54:03Z,politics,Politics,Coronavirus: UK manufacturers urged to consider switching to making ventilators,"Matt Hancock has called on British manufacturers to consider switching parts of their production to the making of medical ventilators needed to treat rising numbers of coronavirus patients. The health secretary said on Sunday the UK had 5,000 ventilators but needed many more times that number. Hancock said “anyone who can” should “turn their engineering minds and production lines to making them … We need to produce more.” Hancock claimed on the Andrew Marr Show that the government was in discussion with “all kinds of companies”, including car manufacturers and military engineers. Rolls-Royce, JCB and Unipart were all expected to speak to the prime minister on a conference call, according to a report in the Sunday Telegraph.
The JCB chairman, Lord Bamford, said: “We have been approached by the prime minister to see if we can help with the production of ventilators. We have research and engineering teams actively looking at the request at the moment. It’s unclear as yet if we can assist, but as a British company we will do whatever we can to help during the unprecedented times our country is facing.” A spokesperson from Unipart confirmed that the company had been approached by the government: “Unipart is not currently engaged in the manufacture of medical products although our company has significant levels of expertise in volume manufacturing, some very skilled engineers, and world-leading capability in logistics. We’re pleased to be involved in such an important project and doing everything we can to help.” According to ITV’s Robert Peston, Rolls-Royce had not been approached by the government. Peston tweeted: “I just spoke to Warren East, the chief executive of Rolls-Royce, one of the UK’s most advanced engineering companies. And he says government has not contacted him yet to discuss whether his or his suppliers’ facilities can be repurposed to make the many thousands of respirators.” Roll-Royce did not reject the possibility that its production could partially switch to the manufacturing of ventilation equipment. A spokesperson said: “We understand that the government is exploring ways in which businesses can help deal with the outbreak of Covid-19. As they shape their plans, we are keen to do whatever we can to help the government and the country at this time and will look to provide any practical help we can.” When Marr questioned the usefulness of new ventilators without extra specialist medical staff, Hancock said: “We’ve got the number of doctors that we have, we want to bring people who are recently retired back into service and, for instance, release doctors from some other duties and get them back into the health service.” Hancock said the NHS would be stopping other activities including elective or non-urgent surgeries.
He said there was “a massive effort going on” to make sure the necessary staff and equipment was in place to tackle the outbreak effectively. Dr Rinesh Parmar, chair of the Doctors’ Association UK and an intensive care doctor, applauded the health secretary’s remarks on the procurement of extra ventilation equipment and additional beds, but said that without more specialist staff such efforts would be “pointless”. “This announcement will be welcomed by doctors across the country who have been shouting from the rooftops about the lack of intensive care resources,” he said.
“Whilst NHS hospitals make emergency plans to create ITU [intensive treatment unit] beds and the government purchases more ventilators, the elephant in the room is the lack of highly trained intensive care nurses and doctors. The NHS faces this pandemic on a background of severe understaffing with almost 43,000 nurse and 10,000 doctor vacancies. It is pointless acquiring new ventilators without enough highly trained staff to operate them.” Parmar added that the purchasing of extra capacity in private hospitals may solve the issue of a lack of physical space in the NHS, but said there were “very few” intensive care beds in private hospitals in the UK. “The systematic under-resourcing of the NHS and exodus of staff that the government has presided over has ultimately left the country with a severe lack of specialist intensive care nurses and doctors,” he said.
The UK ranks 24 out of 31 in comparison with other European nations in terms of the number of critical care beds available per 100,000 inhabitants. Doctors and hospital trusts have revealed that millions of patients will have care delayed as hospitals cancel non-urgent operations, including some surgery for people with heart and lung conditions. Other countries in Europe are also racing to buy or produce more ventilators, with Italy already facing such a dramatic shortage that patients with the best survival chances are being prioritised. Germany has ordered an additional 10,000 ventilators from a domestic supplier, the FT reported. One such ventilator costs about €17,000 (£15,400)."
2020-03-15T06:00:00Z,politics,Politics,"Send out paper ballots, Labour is urged after voting complaints","Labour is being urged to send ballot papers to all members who have not yet voted in its leadership election, after continuing complaints that some are still waiting for their chance to take part. MPs were contacting the party last week with concerns, with some members complaining of a “farcical” situation in which they were having to provide high levels of proof of their identity before being granted a vote. Others said they simply had not received their email entitling them to vote in the online poll. Labour First, a group on the right of the party, surveyed its members earlier this month and found that 10% who responded had not received their electronic ballot paper. Another survey last week asked activists who had not received a ballot for details, and hundreds replied saying that they had had problems. Some members said they had been forced to ask their local council for proof that they were on the electoral roll after being denied a vote by the party. One MP said: “I’ve had loads of members getting in touch with problems, particularly about the electoral register. One who has been persistent in chasing the party has now been given the ballot, but it has required him to get proof from the local authority electoral services. My concern is that for every member who pursues it, there will be others who don’t bother and just don’t vote.” Another MP has also alerted the party to an issue affecting members who are under 18, who cannot use proof of their identity from the electoral register as they are not old enough to be on it. Anyone aged 14 or over can join the party.
Other members said that they had received a ballot for the leadership election, but did not have one for an election for places on the party’s ruling national executive committee, which currently has a majority of members from Labour’s large left wing. Among those complaining are peers, MPs, party officers and councillors, all of whom were long-term members. However, party sources said that the independent company overseeing the ballot believed that it was seeing the level of voting it would expect at this point in the contest. Ballots close on 2 April, with the results announced on 4 April. Some members who have raised concerns said that they had been impressed with the speed at which Jennie Formby, the Labour general secretary, was responding to cases. Party sources said that there were no plans to send out paper ballots to those who had not voted, but Labour is planning to send three reminder emails to members, with the first going out on Monday. Luke Akehurst, secretary of Labour First, said: “We are alarmed that there is clearly a glitch where a large number of members did not receive their NEC ballot, some new members are being ruled out on what appear to be spurious grounds, and – for whatever reason – approaching 10% of members say they haven’t received a ballot at all. The party is resending the NEC ballots, but turnout in this contest will clearly still be affected. We would call on the party to send a paper ballot now to everyone who hasn’t voted yet in case resending emails does not reach them. All these elections are crucial for Labour’s future. It is essential for their democratic legitimacy that every effort has been made to enable every member to vote.” Party sources said that its membership team was working through a plan to ensure that all members could vote and that there were no concerns about their capacity to look at the individual cases being raised. Members can ask for their ballot to be reissued through the party’s website, they said, while there was still plenty of time to cast a vote. A Labour spokesman said: “We are committed to ensuring that the leadership election is open, fair and democratic.”"
2020-03-14T17:55:34Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: coronavirus sparks calls to extend EU transition period,"Britain and the EU are facing calls to back away from a “game of chicken” and extend the Brexit transition period immediately, as both respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Boris Johnson, however, has insisted there will be no change to the transition period – during which the UK follows EU regulations, including its free movement laws. It is scheduled to finish at the end of the year. However, with parts of Europe in lockdown and the UK government expecting the peak of the crisis in Britain in late spring and early summer, some experts are calling for immediate agreement to delay. There are concerns that the peak of the disease in the UK could coincide with critical negotiation deadlines. June is the final month for Britain to ask for an extension beyond this year. Trade expert David Henig is among those calling for a rethink. “I don’t see how you can realistically, by the end of June, make a decision on how trade talks are going,” he said. “You would be doing it with a lot of people under pressure, dealing with something that really is an arbitrary deadline. This is the classic force majeure cause – an unforeseen circumstance of the extreme degree. “This should apply to both sides. The Italians are practically completely in lockdown. They have stopped having all but essential meetings in Brussels. It’s a bit of a game of chicken, with neither side wanting to say they can’t cope with it. An extension could be offered on whatever strict terms.” He also warned the EU that there were signs that its response to the latest round of talks was not as effective as its approach to Britain’s EU divorce deal, finally voted through parliament earlier this year. “The commission are going through the ‘difficult second album’ phase this time round,” he said. “Last time, they were undoubtedly the grown-ups in the room. It’s less clear that that applies this time.” Matthew O’Toole, a former adviser to Theresa May who is now an SDLP politician in Northern Ireland’s assembly, agreed. “Right now, I’m loth to even mention Brexit,” he tweeted. “But, as of today, the UK government is still ruling out extending transition. That is lunatic. The world will soon be recovering from a huge economic shock. No one – not the EU or even Trump’s US – will have time for Brexiter fantasies.” Face-to-face talks, due this week in London, have already been cancelled amid the crisis. Other methods of remote communication are being used. Initial plans suggested there would be five rounds of talks by mid-May, before a crucial summit in June."
2020-03-13T16:37:04Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: EU's demands in negotiations with UK revealed in draft treaty,"Britain will have to guarantee “uniform implementation” of Brussels’s state subsidy rules while the European court of justice will hand down rulings to British courts, under the EU’s vision of the future relationship with the UK. A 441-page treaty draft, obtained by the Guardian, spells out in full legal text for the first time the demands that Brussels will make of David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, in the next round of talks. The document, which is yet to be shared with Boris Johnson’s government, highlights the distance between the two sides across a host of issues, including on the so-called level playing field conditions for British and EU businesses and rules on state aid. Across the board, the EU envisages a close relationship in light of the close economic and security ties of today, including an insistence that the definition of terrorism used by both sides should be based on a current directive as a price for cooperation. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, tweeted: “We’ve sent a draft agreement on new partnership to [the European parliament] & [EU council] for discussion. It shows ambitious and comprehensive future relationship is possible. We must give ourselves every chance of success. We will publish the text after our exchanges & look forward to working [with the UK]”. In response, Frost tweeted: “We announced on 9 March we would share a draft FTA & other texts shortly. Thank you for making clear the EU will too.” The document appears to signal a weakening in the EU position in only one key area: its demands on fisheries, where the 27 member states had until now been seeking to “uphold” the current common fisheries policy (CFP). The CFP relies on historical catching patterns to determine how much fish each nation can take. The new text acknowledges the UK demand for scientific advice to take precedence and appears to downgrade the commitment to “respecting” the status quo. Elsewhere, however, the draft treaty offers little succour to the British government, which insists that it will not sign up to any arrangements that involve continued direct application of current EU law or oblige parliament to implement new Brussels rules in the future. Despite the British insistence that it will devise its own state aid rules, limiting the level of subsidies from the government for ailing airlines, steel manufacturers and other industrial actors, legal text drafted by Barnier emphasises the need for the UK to apply the EU’s own rule book and “harmonise” with Brussels as policies develop. The document stipulates that where there are disputes on state aid rules, the European court of justice in Luxembourg will be the arbiter of EU law and issue binding rulings to the British courts to implement. Where Brussels devises entirely new rules on state aid, whether to industry or farmers, a new joint committee will have to sit within six weeks and “add the new act or provision” or the EU would be free to implement “sanctions” that “have a real and deterrent effect”. The draft treaty also insists that the UK will have to guarantee “non regression” on EU regulations on labour and social protection despite its withdrawal from the bloc. On environmental standards, the EU insists that targets set by Brussels will also apply to the UK after it leaves the single market and customs union at the end of the year. The regulations referred to in the document include industrial emissions, air quality targets and nature and biodiversity conservation. The document also refers to harmonisation on “health and sanitary safety in the agricultural and food sector”, in a sign that the EU will resist changes to UK laws to allow the production of chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-treated beef. The US government is likely to demand access to the British market for such produce, which would undercut UK farmers unless they too could change their practices. The next round of negotiations between the two sides, which started last month, was due to take place next week but face-to-face talks in London have been cancelled in response to the coronavirus pandemic. EU and UK officials were expected to take part in stripped back talks through videoconference calls. Failure to agree a deal by the end of the year will require both sides to implement tariffs and quota conditions on goods being traded between the UK and the EU."
2020-03-13T15:48:14Z,politics,Politics,Is 'refreshingly untribal' Lisa Nandy Labour's best hope?,"On the Monday after Jeremy Corbyn led Labour to its worst general election defeat since 1935, Lisa Nandy headed to Ashfield in Nottinghamshire to stand outside a Co-op in the December gloom. There, alongside Gloria de Piero, the local Labour MP between 2010 and 2019, she asked shoppers why so many voters had deserted Labour – the constituency now had a Conservative MP with a 5,733 majority. The women took a pasting. They were harangued by nurses and ex-miners who had voted Tory for the first time, believing it was their “patriotic duty” to stop Corbyn from getting into No 10. Nandy made a promise to one of them, a pitman called Keith: “I’m going to make it my mission to win you back.” Keith probably didn’t know who she was. Despite serving as shadow minister for children, then charities and eventually energy, the now-40-year-old Mancunian only came to national prominence in 2016, when she was one of 20 Labour frontbenchers to quit in protest at Corbyn’s leadership, going on to chair Owen Smith’s doomed attempt at the top job. A few weeks after meeting Keith, Nandy wrote a letter to the Wigan Post announcing she was standing for Labour leader, warning that unless the party changed it would collapse into irrelevance. She began as the underdog and three months later she still is. By all conventional metrics, she is going to lose. She was endorsed by fewer MPs, fewer constituency Labour parties and fewer affiliate organisations than her rivals. The bookies think Keir Starmer will win by a landslide. So do the polls.
Many Tory MPs are hoping the bookies are right. Paul Bristow, the new MP for Peterborough, knew Nandy when they were both councillors on Hammersmith and Fulham council in London between 2006 and 2010. The Conservatives controlled the council then and she soon stepped up to be opposition spokesperson on housing. He found her “refreshingly un-tribal”. He thinks she might be the biggest threat to Boris Johnson. “I think she’s more relatable. She’s got personality. She understands where Labour have gone wrong. I’m certainly not scared of going out on the doorstep and competing against Sir Keir in seats like Peterborough. He’s not ruled out wanting to rejoin the EU … I don’t think he’s got the personality that will connect with people in Peterborough. I’m not in any way worried about Rebecca Long-Bailey. People have rejected that ideology once and they will reject it again.”
Robert Largan, who beat Labour in the marginal Derbyshire seat of High Peak after also serving on Hammersmith council, agrees. “She is the one who seems to have done the most thinking about why they lost. She’s not tainted by Corbyn and has been critical of him. I think the fact she is a northerner has a lot more cut-through.” Plus there’s the fact she is a mixed-race woman who held on to Wigan (63.9% leave) despite being unapologetically pro-remain (but against a second referendum and for a brexit deal) and pro-immigration – albeit on a majority cut by almost 10,000 to 6,728 – and holding a world-view that manages to mix hyperlocalism and internationalism with a healthy dollop of pragmatism. Largan cited her “reasonableness”, which he thinks would be welcomed by a public fed up with adversarial politics: “I think having a more consensual politics is what the public would quite like. They are fed up of these really toxic divisions.” After she was elected to the (then) safe seat of Wigan in 2010, some Labour bigwigs were less impressed. Her experience as a London councillor, and previous work with Centrepoint, the homelessness charity, and then for the Children’s Society, did not cut much ice with Sir Peter Smith, who ran Wigan council for 27 years until 2018.
He has endorsed Starmer, saying Nandy “has never been tested in a real job. Being a leader, particularly if you want to be prime minister, you have got to show you can take difficult decisions.” Nandy was brought up in a family that pushed for change: her Kolkata-born father, Dipak Nandy, helped write Labour’s Race Relations Act; her mother, Luise Fitzwalter, produced hard-hitting documentaries for Granada; and her maternal grandfather, Lord Byers, was the leader of the Liberals in the House of Lords. She insists she was the non-academic one of the family – her sister, Francesca, went to Oxford, while she went to study politics at Newcastle – but home was always a fulcrum of debate. Balbir Chatrik, who is still Centrepoint’s head of policy, said Nandy had been “really passionate” in trying to change the rules on homeless 16- and 17-year-olds stuck in bed and breakfast accommodation. Kathy Evans, who was head of policy at the Children’s Society, gave Nandy her next job, in 2005, and remembers she was “very good at building relationships with people she disagrees with”. “She’s got great spirit. I think I probably spent more time disagreeing with her on matters of policy than most of the rest of the team. But disagreeing well, if that makes sense; disagreeing in a way that was always thought-provoking.” In Wigan town hall, Smith and Nandy disagreed often. Now, he thinks she’s got her priorities all wrong. He despaired when she became mired in controversy after signing a pledge from the Labour Campaign for Trans Rights that vowed to expel members of some feminist groups from the party. “She’s made it clear during this election what she thinks about LGBT rights, but not HS2 … HS2 is much more important,” said Smith. She also irritated him by saying Tony Blair had perpetuated “the consensus that Thatcher built”. “All that stuff attacking Blair – we are not going to win if we write out Blair from history. People in Leigh [Wigan’s neighbour, which went Tory in December] were better off in a Blair government.” Donna Hall, chief executive of Wigan council until last year, said Nandy had a “laser-like bullshit detector”. “She was able on our first meeting with politicians on Wigan council to cut right through through the rhetoric, the excuses, and get right to the heart of the issues facing communities. She didn’t have it easy with some of the older male Labour councillors who thought she was a young woman out of her depth. How wrong they were.” However, support from other Greater Manchester grandees is conspicuous in its absence. For instance, Andy Burnham, MP for Leigh from 2005 until 2017 and now the mayor of Greater Manchester, has not endorsed anyone and says he is “unclear where Lisa stands on devolution”. A Nandy trademark is admitting she doesn’t have all the answers. During her BBC interview with Andrew Neil, she was asked what in her CV would equip her to deal with an international crisis, after the US had assassinated Qassem Soleimani, the leader of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. “I have the humility to know that one individual can’t deal with an international crisis,” she said. “I’m not claiming for a moment to be a greater expert than someone who has spent the last 20 years working in foreign affairs. But nor do I think that it’s the job of a prime minister to pretend to have all the answers.” It was a typical Nandy response, one which shows either a refreshing ability to admit her own fallibility – or a frustrating tendency to pass the buck, depending on your opinion. Last Friday teatime she was addressing a meeting in Blackburn, hastily convened by local councillors campaigning to erect a statue of Barbara Castle, the town’s former MP and long-serving Labour cabinet minister. Nandy launched her leadership bid in Dagenham, where female Ford workers went on strike for fair pay in 1968. Their fight was taken up by Castle, then secretary of state for employment, who pushed through the 1970 Equal Pay Act. “The way [Castle] conducted herself in politics, the way she heard those women and opened the door to change – that’s the sort of politics that I believe in, not the sort of politics where, Churchill-like, when you get yourself elected to parliament, you decide you have all the answers and pronounce to people from the dispatch box about what those answers are,” she told the Blackburn gathering. It didn’t persuade everyone. One middle-aged man stood up and introduced himself as a “disillusioned Labour supporter”. “The way I see it, this is all about electability. I’m all for equal rights and women’s rights and all that, but the people out there, the public, they need specific things,” he said. “You need to be a bit more specific about what my kids are going to get, in their schooling and hospitals.” It was a remark that cut to a common criticism of Nandy. As one Labour MP in the north-west puts it: “The question is: is she a commentator or is she a leader? She’s done really well and built a good profile for herself around towns. But what are her solutions to the problems she has diagnosed?” Nandy insists she has a plan to rebuild the Labour party and win back “red wall” seats such as Ashfield and Leigh, by embedding Labour members in every community. She wants Labour to set up creches, credit unions and food banks to show people that Labour is a party that cares about their wellbeing rather than simply their vote. It is a laudable plan but a difficult one to execute, and many Labour members may prefer to believe that top-down policy-making will win a general election rather than hard slog on the ground. But maybe a hard slog is the only way out of the quagmire?

2020-03-13T15:28:33Z,politics,Politics,MP Bridgen enters Covid-19 row between wife and Dorries,"The MP Andrew Bridgen has waded into an online row between his wife and the health minister Nadine Dorries over how the latter dealt with her coronavirus diagnosis. Bridgen has a cold and a cough and claims he sat next to Dorries, who has been diagnosed with the illness, in a tearoom in Westminster. Nevena Bridgen, an opera singer, claimed online on Friday morning that Dorries had jeopardised her family’s health by not mentioning him to Public Health England (PHE) staff who were tracing people with whom she had had contact before her diagnosis. In response, Dorries said she had not been sitting anywhere near Bridgen but had advised him that if he was worried he should call 111. Bridgen told the Guardian: “I can assure you that Nadine Dorries came and sat next to me at the end of my table. I wonder why she would now deny this? “My wife is an opera singer; she really is a prima donna whereas Nadine only acts like a prima donna.” Regarding his symptoms, the Tory backbencher said: “I don’t feel right. I am still waiting for a test. My 76-year-old mother-in-law [who lives with the family] is feeling all right at the moment. “I am locking myself away at one end of the house, which is particularly upsetting when your 18-month-old son is crying for you. He is toddling and knows how to open doors. But I have to keep him locked out.” After Dorries tweeted praise for the PHE contact tracers, Nevena Bridgen wrote: “Why did you not tell them that you sat next to my husband Andrew Bridgen on Thursday in a tearoom and that he can’t get the test now! “I have the baby and a 75-year-old mother jeopardised. You were treated but no one is coming to help us!” Dorries replied on Twitter: “Because I did not sit next to your husband. He was in the tearoom when I walked in, on another table not close to me. “He texted me and told me he had sat next to me, I was too ill to discuss but not sick enough not to know, that wasn’t true. I told him if he was worried to call 111.” Nevena Bridgen replied to Dorries, saying: “I’m sorry that you’re sick, I wish you to get well but let me tell you. You absolutely did sit next to my husband in the tearoom.” The government advice for those showing mild symptoms changed on Thursday; people will no longer be tested and it is recommended they stay isolated at home. Andrew Bridgen said after talking to 111 he was under the impression that he, his son and mother-in-law would be tested. His wife had been in Belgrade, Serbia, having travelled there for a performance that was cancelled because of the coronavirus, and returned to the UK on Thursday. She charts her life on her Wives of Westminster blog, covering fashion, parenting and being a parliamentary “plus one”. In response to someone who contacted her on Twitter, Nevena Bridgen said: “I guess if you are not a minister you do not get test nor help.” Twitter users expressed dismay that the pair had argued on social media, with one writing: “We need to pull together in a global crisis.” Andrew Bridgen told the Guardian on Thursday he believed parliament had been too slow to react to the virus, given that visitors entered the building from all over the world. The international development secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, has received a negative test result for coronavirus but is isolating at home, bringing the total number of MPs believed to be self-isolating to 11. Charles Walker, Edward Argar and Rachael Maskell are among those to have stopped face-to-face meetings, doing surgery work by phone."
2020-03-13T13:54:03Z,politics,Politics,"Brexit will not be delayed by coronavirus, says Johnson","Boris Johnson is adamant the Brexit transition period will close at the end of December, despite the risk of the Covid-19 crisis disrupting negotiations, his spokesman has said. Face-to-face talks which were to take place in London next week had been called off as a result of the outbreak, with officials exploring possible alternatives, such as video-conferencing. When Johnson’s spokesman was asked whether the status quo transition period might need to be extended as a result, he said simply: “No”, then added: “In UK law, a request for an extension is not possible”. When the government passed the EU withdrawal agreement in December, it added a commitment that the transition period would not be lengthened. Pressed on whether that meant the government was prepared to leave without a trade deal if the negotiations were interrupted by virus prevention measures, the spokesman said: “It will be possible to do the trade talks. Both the UK and the EU are fully aware of the timetable which we’re working towards.” He said both sides had committed to finding alternative ways to continue the negotiations, and were working closely together to achieve this. “The discussions can take place using an alternative forum, such as video-conferencing,” he said. “Video-conferencing is something which is used throughout the world, and business.” The government still expected to share a draft agreement with EU negotiators before the next round of talks, he said. The negotiations, led by Johnson’s EU adviser, David Frost, involve more than 100 officials. During the transition period, the UK remains subject to EU rules and institutions, and continues to pay into its budget. This is to be replaced at the end of the year with an agreement on the future relationship, including on trade and security. Despite the prime minister’s warning on Thursday that many more families would lose loved ones to Covid-19, the government has eschewed some of the more draconian measures in place in other countries. Parliament has remained open, and Johnson’s spokesman said local elections in May were also expected to go ahead, despite a request from the Electoral Commission on Thursday for a delay. In a letter to the government, the commission said holding the elections would put unnecessary pressure on local authorities already having to deal with the public health crisis. “The risks to delivery that have been identified are such that we cannot be confident that voters will be able to participate in the polls safely and confidently, nor that campaigners and parties will be able to put their case to the electorate,” it said. However, Johnson’s spokesman said that, for the moment, “we are working to facilitate the local, mayoral and police and crime commissioner elections on 7 May. We continue to work closely with those delivering the elections, while being led by evidence.” Local elections were postponed in 2001 because of the foot-and-mouth outbreak that affected many farms."
2020-03-13T07:00:54Z,politics,Politics,How will we report on the EU now that the UK is out?,"Shortly before Brexit, a touching little farewell ceremony took place in the Berlaymont, the European commission’s Brussels headquarters. On Jean-Claude Juncker’s last day as president of the commission, he made a final appearance in the basement press room at midday – the time the commission has been briefing the world’s press every day for much of the past 60 years. Juncker gave an emotional valedictory. When he stopped speaking, an Italian journalist stood up. “History will judge you, Mr Juncker,” the journalist said solemnly, “but we will never forget you” before urging a round of applause for the Luxembourger’s “30 years as a true European”. A British reporter shook his head in mild disapproval at the tribute, muttering: “You did your job, Mr Juncker, we did ours.”
The moment summed up much about the British – and the British media’s – relationship with the EU. UK political reporting culture prides itself on keeping a sense of distance, holding power to account. But for much of the UK’s 50 years of membership, British coverage of the EU seemed so confrontational as to lose all sense of perspective. Deliberations in Brussels were written up as national victories or defeats – an art form pioneered in the early 1990s by a young reporter by the name of Boris Johnson). The idea of compromise and collaboration simply didn’t enter into the adversarial narrative. The question now is, with the UK relegated to the sidelines, will the Eurosceptic British press just disengage or gloat at every setback? Post-Brexit, collective decisions taken by the EU27 will continue to have a profound impact across the European economic space. Britain will be affected. Will its press be watching? Daniel Boffey, the Guardian’s Brussels bureau chief, says a narrowly focused UK media could find its access to the corridors of power in Brussels receding in time. “Much of what is leaked and briefed in Brussels is done to influence the internal debates among member states on key policy decisions – and to influence the views of the domestic electorates,” Boffey said. “But the British government is no longer a decision-maker in Brussels.” Boffey believes that the Guardian’s huge readership, broad European appeal and stated commitment to cover pan-European affairs in all their complexity will guarantee its relevance. “In the run-up to Brexit, people often asked me whether I would be staying in Brussels,” his Brussels-based colleague Jennifer Rankin said. “It was an easy answer. I wasn’t going anywhere because (I think) the UK will be in semi-permanent negotiations with the EU over something. But also because we are here to cover the EU in all its rich complexity. I’m delighted that the answer is even easier today.” Just figuring out what is going on in Brussels can be the initial challenge for the newly arrived EU correspondent. Not necessarily because it is the remote, elite place of legend, but because it is a complex, hybrid decision-making system that lacks any parallel in national politics. John Palmer was dispatched to Brussels for the Guardian in 1974, the year after Britain acceded to full membership. Those early years were “primitive” for journalists, Palmer recalls. Reporters were left to stand in muddy fields to wait for ministers to emerge from whichever German schloss their meeting was taking place in. Palmer had a ringside seat for all the huge political realignments that followed the end of communism in 1989 and the EU’s expansion eastward.
He also chronicled the extraordinary political switch in the Conservative view of Europe – from enthusiastic backing to open hostility. The high watermark of the European project coincided with the tenure of the charismatic Jacques Delors in the 1990s. “Delors came to symbolise the push towards European integration,” says Palmer. “Yet it was clear from early on that decisions would have repercussions on national politics. The UK drove hard for the single market. But then it began to assume a dynamic of its own – you could see it would eventually lead to a single currency.” British diplomats also became “aghast”, Palmer recalls, to see that Bavarians, Catalans and other autonomous regions had their own “governments” represented in the EU’s committee of the regions. “They began to see where all this might lead,” he said.
By then global media interest had ballooned and the EU could boast a press corps to rival Capitol Hill. “All three Mexican TV channels had a correspondent accredited,” Palmer remembers. Stephen Bates was Brussels correspondent for the Guardian for four years in the 1990s and remembers a panic-inducing bewilderment at the acronyms, arcane structures, committees, the system of porte-paroles [spokespersons], all rooted deep in French administrative culture. A former Westminster reporter, Bates grew to love the role because “for all its faults the EU had a forward looking and expanding view, it was a positive project for Europeans and it was about collaboration”. He blames British political journalism for much of the incomprehension. “UK journalism is predicated along Westminster lines: a majority government is in power, and it does things. But the EU works in labyrinthine circles, decision making is slow and often very technical, as well as being essentially about collaboration and compromise.” The paradox was that the EU was attacked for ruling people’s lives, when the opposite was true. “In a way, the problem is that it is so diffuse it’s very difficult to get a decision through,” Bates says. Often it’s a miracle that 27 countries can agree about anything. Bates recalls a story about how UK chocolate was going to have to be relabelled “vegelate”, because it contained so little cocoa compared with Belgian or French varieties. “I wrote that story at least four times,” says Bates “and it was always illustrated with the same picture of a bar of Dairy Milk. But we never seemed to get it resolved because it kept being referred back.” That is a feeling familiar to Rankin. “The EU often feels like one endless process: meetings that result in decisions to convene a meeting at a higher level. One broadcast colleague complained there were never any pictures in Brussels: just endless shots of middle-aged men shaking hands in rooms.” A regular complaint from those hostile to the EU is that it is undemocratic, with decisions cooked up behind closed doors. Palmer blames the democratic deficit on a decision by national governments deliberately to keep the directly elected European parliament weak. But no Brussels correspondent ever complains about a lack of information. “Finding out what had been decided was never a problem,” Palmer insists. “What was more difficult was to establish what would happen next or what lay behind any decision. What you never did was rely solely on your own government to tell you. You went to talk to the Finns, the Irish, whoever.” The skill, adds Rankin, is in knowing what not to bother about. “Brussels has always been abundant in information, the trick is finding the useful nuggets from endless press releases, announcements and invitations.” Rankin is on her second spell in Brussels – and notices a big difference from her first stint in 2006. “In my first stint, the UK was part of the EU machine,” she recalled. “British ministers spoke on the record to British and international media after EU councils. “By the time I returned (in 2015) the UK was detached. Barely touched by the eurozone or migration crisis of 2015, the UK also didn’t play such a big role in the EU law-making councils. Those on-the-record ministerial meetings with journalists had disappeared.” The expectation is that this detachment will only grow, with less and less about the EU and European affairs in the pages of British newspapers. Katherine Butler was a Europe correspondent in the 1990s."
2020-03-12T20:19:50Z,politics,Politics,No 10 coronavirus briefing reassuring in its lack of reassurance,"Things fall apart. Just a little, at any rate. Moments after the latest Cobra meeting had broken up, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, went rogue and gave her own press conference. The coronavirus pandemic had gone beyond the “containment” phase and into “delay”. People with a dry cough and a fever should self-isolate. Large gatherings of more than 500 in Scotland would almost certainly be banned from Monday. Enough time to make sure the Old Firm derby between Rangers and Celtic could be played on Sunday. A little over an hour later, Boris Johnson emerged into the familiar setting of the Downing Street state room to give his third coronavirus presser inside two weeks. There will be plenty more to come. His message was pretty much identical to Sturgeon’s, other than to declare that sports events and concerts would be going ahead in the rest of the UK for the foreseeable future. His irritation at being pre-empted by the first minister on further measures was mostly kept in check. Only a barb at the lack of resilience in the Scottish health service betrayed his feelings. Boris was here to tell the country we were in for a long haul, but he already looked on his knees. He has aged appreciably over the last few weeks. The eyes are puffier, the bags baggier and the complexion pastier. Being prime minister is turning out to be a lot less fun than becoming it. He looks sleep-deprived.
The responsibility is weighing heavy. He isn’t used to being held accountable for anything – his whole life up till now has been an exercise in self-indulgence – but he knows that he will be forever judged by the decisions he makes now. The smirking clown might have worked well for Brexit, but now the country is demanding a serious leader. Just for the moment, he is having to fake it to make it. And it’s just about working. The man who has a psychological aversion to bad news is having to level with cosmological truths. The soft-soap, occasional comic asides and veneer of self-confidence have given way to something more real. The sense of despair and self-doubt that Boris has worked so hard throughout his life to keep internalised is now etched into every line of his face, drenched in every sentence he haltingly utters. Having to tell a lot of people they might die can do that to you.
Sensibly, Boris had once again come flanked by the new de facto joint prime ministers – the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance – and he rightly deferred to them on matters of science and epidemiology. Both men were hugely impressive: when they were sure of the numbers they said so, and when they weren’t they also said so. There was no artifice, no bullshit. Just cold hard truths. We were about four weeks behind Italy and the virus might not peak for nine to 14 weeks. There was almost something reassuring in their lack of reassurance. For the first time in years, the public were being treated as adults. Just about the only question ducked was the one about what constituted being “old”. Something of personal concern to those of us in our early 60s. Inevitably, most of the questions from the media were about whether the UK was doing enough. Other countries were closing schools, closing borders, closing down large public gatherings, closing travel. We were just advising people with symptoms to stay indoors for seven days, schools to cancel overseas trips, and people to wash their hands. With the proviso we would probably be implementing stricter measures at a later date. Not for the first time, it felt as if many in the country were ahead of the government in their response to the coronavirus. Many people had seen what was going down in Italy and had already cancelled large social gatherings, non-essential travel and were making plans to work from home where possible. Better safe than sorry. Boris, Whitty and Vallance were as one, though. The science was on their side. Which presumably meant that it wasn’t on the side of all those countries who had made more radical, earlier interventions. The three amigos were insistent that if we moved too soon, people would get bored of taking the proper precautions when the pandemic spiked. Not everyone in the room was wholly convinced. The idea that everyone would be running round the streets coughing over one another when they knew the risk of infection was at its highest just because they had already been cooped up for a few weeks seemed far-fetched. But the science was the science. And Boris was banking on his science being the right science. He wasn’t to be forced into doing anything before it could be shown to have a noticeable effect. In the meantime, he wished everyone well and asked for everyone to look out for one another. Especially the vulnerable and the elderly. Brexit was never going to bring the country together. But coronavirus just might. As he left the press conference, Boris had his fingers firmly crossed. So did I."
2020-03-12T19:29:33Z,politics,Politics,UK and EU agree to 'dial down rhetoric' in Brexit talks,"The UK and the EU have agreed to “dial down the rhetoric” over Brexit in an effort to open up space for a deal, it has emerged. Brussels and London are expected to produce legal texts of their negotiating positions next week, with diplomatic sources claiming both sides have agreed to “lower the temperature” to enable the texts to be considered in detail to assess the scale of the divergence. “The moment you see the legal texts, that’s when you see how good or bad things really are,” one insider said. Next week’s Brexit talks in London have been cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak, but in a joint statement both sides said they were looking at alternative options, such as teleconferencing. “Given the latest Covid-19 developments, UK and EU negotiators have today jointly decided not to hold next week’s round of negotiations in London, in the form originally scheduled,” a joint UK and EU statement said on Thursday. “Both sides are currently exploring alternative ways to continue discussions, including if possible the use of video conferences.” While the coronavirus outbreak has pushed Brexit out of the spotlight, negotiators are concerned that behind-the-scenes efforts must continue if they are to seal the outline of a deal before June. Four areas, including fisheries and crime and justice, have already been identified as the areas of deepest conflict – with little hope of progress in the second round of talks. On Northern Ireland, the EU has made it clear the onus is on the UK to come up with a plan to implement the controversial special arrangements, which include a trade barrier down the Irish Sea. The expectation is that the UK will come to the inaugural meeting of the EU-UK joint committee meeting on 30 March with its first such proposals. “The ball is now in the UK court,” one source said. “It is up to the UK to tell us how they are going to implement this.” While there has been a notable de-escalation in the war of words, there is concern about the fundamental clash in approaches to Brexit; the UK defining it as a battle of sovereignty and the EU prioritising the economic case for close relations. Fisheries is seen as a clear case in point, with the UK arguing the case for control over its waters, and the EU arguing for an economic partnership in which both sides will continue to fish in British waters. Both sides are expecting a major battle over fisheries, one of the least economically important areas of trade but the one that “wins or loses elections”.
With the UK vowing not to extend the transition period beyond 31 December, negotiations experts say a row will inevitably be deployed as a tactic, possibly by both sides. “You have limited time, you are in the worst possible scenario as a rule-taker and money-giver, so extending the transition period is not politically sustainable. So what do you do to achieve a deal? You dramatise it enough to create the tension to force a deal,” one source said. It has also become increasingly apparent in Brussels that London is not going to shift its position on Brexit as primarily an issue of sovereignty, rather than economics, causing problems in areas where agreement could easily be reached. On Wednesday, Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, told MPs there would not be an agreement on Reach, the EU body of rules that govern chemicals. Speaking as one of the most powerful government ministers in relation to Brexit, Gove indicated the government was not objecting to divergence on the Reach rules, telling MPs “one of the problems is that it involves the European court of justice”."
2020-03-12T19:06:41Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson calls coronavirus 'worst public health crisis for a generation' – as it happened,"Here are the main points from the news conference. Boris Johnson was joined by Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser. Johnson said that Britain was facing the “worst public health crisis for a generation” and that “many more” people would die. (See 5.52pm.) In a marked change of tone from his previous press conferences and interviews on this subject, he explained that Britons were going to face considerable disruption to ordinary life over the next few months as the government introduced measures to delay and limit the spread of Covid-19. Johnson said the true number of coronavirus cases in the population was probably “much higher” than official figures suggest. He said: The number of cases will rise sharply, indeed the true number of cases is higher - perhaps much higher - than the number of cases we have so far confirmed with tests. Vallance said he thought the actual number of people infected in the UK at the moment could be between 5,000 and 10,000. The official number of confirmed cases is 596. Johnson confirmed that the UK was now moving out of the “contain” phase and into the “delay” phase for dealing with the epidemic. He said: This is now not just to attempt to contain the disease as far as possible, but to delay its spread and thereby minimise the suffering. If we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our NHS will be in a stronger state as the weather improves and fewer people suffer from normal respiratory diseases, more beds are available and we’ll have more time for medical research. We can also act to stretch the peak of the disease over a longer period so that our society is better able to cope. Johnson said that people with a fever or a new, persistent cough were now being asked to stay at home for seven days. He also said schools were being advised to cancel overseas trips, and the over-70s and the ill were being told to avoid cruises. He said: From tomorrow, if you have coronavirus symptoms, however mild -- either a new continuous cough or a high temperature -- then you should stay at home for at least 7 days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease. We advise all those over 70 and those with serious medical conditions against going on cruises and we advise against international school trips. He said that at some point in the future the government would go further, and ask all family members to stay at home if someone was ill. He said: At some point in the next few weeks we are likely to go further and if someone in a household has those symptoms then we will be asking everyone in that household will stay at home. He also said that at some point in the future the elderly would be asked to stay away from places or people to avoid infection. He did not give details. He said at the moment he was not planning to ban sporting events, but he said this was being kept under review. He said: We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures. And the scientific advice, as we’ve said over the last couple of weeks, is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread but there’s also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services. In a mild dig at Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister who is planning to cancel events with crowds of more than 500 people from next week and whose decision to announce the results of the Cobra meeting before Johnson angered some in No 10, Johnson said that Scotland might have a particular issue with the resilience of its emergency services. He implied that that was why the Scots needed a different policy. Vallance said cancelling sporting events could be counterproductive. He explained: On average, one person infects two or three others. You therefore have a very low probability of infecting a large number of people in a stadium and a rather higher probability of infecting people very close to you. And that means that most of the transmission actually tends to take place with friends and colleagues and those in close environments - and not in the big environments. Though it is true that any cancellation of things can have some effect, if you then get a displacement activity where you end up with everyone congregating somewhere else, you may actually perversely have an increased risk, particularly in an indoor environment. So it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t at some point make the decision from a resilience point but this is not a major way to tackle this epidemic. Johnson defended his decision not to introduce measures as draconian as those being introduced in some other other countries. He said: The measures that I have discussed today... staying at home if you think you have the symptoms, your whole household staying at home, looking after the elderly - making sure the elderly and vulnerable stay at home - these are the three most powerful defensive lines. We think it’s very important to maintain public trust and confidence in what we are doing, throughout this challenging time, always to be guided by the best possible scientific advice. He and his advisers also argued that, if self-isolation measures were introduced too early, they would be ineffective - because people would ignore them at the point where they were most necessary. Whitty said he thought the overall mortality rate from Covid-19 was around 1% or less. It was higher for older people, and people in the vulnerable group, and lower for others, he said. But he said he did not want to speculate on who many people might die from the illness because he said the scientists just did not know how many people are infected. He said, although an 80% infection rate was the government’s top reasonable worst case scenario, nowhere in the world was currently coming close to an infection level like that. Vallance said that the outbreak in the UK could be about four weeks behind the outbreak in Italy. Vallance said the peak of the epidemic in the UK was “something like 10 to 14 weeks away”. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments."
2020-03-12T17:12:02Z,politics,Politics,Policy of building homes on flood plains to be reviewed,"The government has announced a review into the building of thousands of homes on land at the highest risk of flooding following the worst winter storms in years. The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, told MPs on Thursday that officials would review the policy of building homes on high-risk flood plains and bring forward changes “in the coming months”. The announcement, made at the end of a wide-ranging speech on the future of planning, will have significant implications for the government’s aim to build 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s to ease the chronic housing shortage. It comes after the Guardian revealed that one in 10 of all new homes in England since 2013 have been built on land the government considers at the highest risk of flooding, with more than 11,000 planned for high-risk flood zones in the counties battered by storms in November and February. Building on land prone to flooding is a risk to new homeowners and compounds the danger for surrounding areas, experts have said, as flood water that could otherwise be soaked up by green space instead runs quickly off concrete and into rivers.
Jenrick told MPs: “We should seize this opportunity to consider how the built and natural environments can work together more harmoniously, and in that spirit, I will be reviewing our policy to prevent building in areas of high flood risk. “Given the recent devastation suffered by so many of our communities, we are putting an extra £5.2bn into flood defences.” Jenrick said the review would prioritise steering new developments “away from needless urban sprawl and the ruination of the countryside” and away from areas at the highest risk of flooding, which is about 10% of land in England. He added: “I hope more broadly that the announcement I have made today of a review of how the planning system interacts with flood plains and the increased risk of flooding that we are seeing in many parts of the country will be good news to those parts of the country that have seen floods in the last few weeks, and that we can bring forward changes in the coming months.” A joint investigation by the Guardian and Greenpeace’s Unearthed news unit last month found that of the 11,410 new homes planned across seven flood-stricken English authorities, 1,479 are in four of the areas hit hardest by Storms Ciara and Dennis: Calderdale, Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcester. Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace’s chief scientist, said “The government has provided no details on this, but it seems as if ministers may have finally realised that building new homes in areas with high flood risk and inadequate defences is a recipe for continual disaster. “This is one of many examples where for far too long, the government has talked about the climate emergency without treating it as if it was real. The widespread damage and human suffering from the recent flooding have shown just how real it is. “The government should work up a more sensible policy that empowers local councils and the environmental watchdog to stand up to pressure from developers who are putting profits before people’s safety.”"
2020-03-12T13:01:44Z,politics,Politics,Government to revamp smart motorways after safety concerns,"An 18-point plan to tackle the safety of smart motorways has been announced by the UK government, including abolishing “dynamic” hard shoulders, speeding up detection technology for stopped vehicles and building more emergency refuge areas. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, paid tribute to victims of traffic collisions and campaigners for safer roads as he announced moves to “raise the bar” on motorway safety. He said: “What the evidence shows is that, in most ways, smart motorways are as safe as, or safer than, the conventional ones. But not in every way.” Shapps said dynamic hard shoulders were confusing. Such motorways, on which the hard shoulder operates only part-time and is a live running lane the rest of the time, will be converted to all-lane running – with refuge areas instead of a hard shoulder – by 2025. Motoring organisations said the moves were a “victory for common sense and safety”. A review was launched by the Department for Transport after revelations that there had been a spike in near-misses on converted sections of the M25, compared with conventional motorways. A former transport minister who signed off the policy to build more smart motorways also called for their rollout to be halted, saying commitments on safety had been ignored. Mike Penning cited “harrowing” evidence from the deaths of drivers who had broken down in live traffic and were killed in crashes while awaiting help. At least 38 people have died on stretches of smart motorways in the past five years, and motoring organisations believe a number of those deaths were avoidable. Shapps defended the role of smart motorways in helping the road network cope with a 23% rise in traffic since 2000. He said: “They save motorists thousands of hours sitting in jams. They reduce the disruption and environmental destruction which would otherwise be needed to widen our busiest roads.” Other measures announced to improve safety included: Speeding up the deployment of stopped vehicle detection technology to cover the network within the next three years, allowing problems to be spotted within 20 seconds and lanes to be closed more quickly. Faster attendance by more Highways England traffic officer patrols on smart motorways. Reducing the distance between places to stop in an emergency to three quarters of a mile where feasible, and to a maximum of 1 mile. Building 10 more emergency areas on the M25 where there has been a higher rate of breakdown. Making emergency areas more visible with a bright orange surface, and better signed. A £5m campaign to increase public awareness and knowledge of smart motorways. Automatic detection of and enforcement action against drivers ignoring the red “X” sign in closed lanes. The AA, which had long campaigned to change smart motorway design, welcomed the move. Edmund King, its president, said: “The measures announced by the transport secretary are a victory for common sense and safety. The fact that 38% of breakdowns happen in live lanes on smart motorways means drivers have been at risk. Tragically, people have lost their lives, and in some cases coroners have indicated this could have been avoided. “No driver wants to be stuck in a live lane with nowhere to go; at best it is incredibly distressing, at worst it can be fatal. We believe the intention to place emergency refuge areas at every three-quarters of a mile is a great outcome and what we have called for over the last decade.”
But the RAC gave a mixed reaction, describing the end of dynamic hard shoulders as a “red herring”, given that such systems represented a fraction of the network. Its head of roads policy, Nicholas Lyes, said: “Two-thirds of drivers tell us they believe permanently removing the hard shoulder compromises safety in the event of a breakdown. “While it is welcome that the government has listened to their concerns and undertaken this review, it remains to be seen whether these measures go far enough to protect drivers who are unfortunate enough to break down in live lanes.”"
2020-03-11T18:30:15Z,politics,Politics,UK to impose digital sales tax despite risk of souring US trade talks,"The government has set out plans to impose a digital services tax on the UK revenues of online companies including Google and Facebook, in a move that could sour trade talks with the US. The 2% levy on the British revenues of search engines, social media services and online marketplaces, first announced in the 2018 budget, is an attempt to keep some of the economic value created by technology companies in the country, ahead of planned international action by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Some of the world’s biggest companies pay relatively little UK tax, because the digital services they offer, such as advertising and fees for connecting buyers to sellers, technically take place offshore. That allows them to keep their tax burden low in major economies, and book the majority of their revenues in low-tax environments such as Ireland and Luxembourg. The digital services tax will instead be charged on revenue raised from UK sales, regardless of where the company is based. Estimates suggest it will eventually raise more than £500m a year, but it was not part of Wednesday’s budget announcement. The confirmation was buried instead in a tranche of documents release by the Treasury. The quiet launch will be seen as an attempt to downplay the news at a time when the UK is preparing to try to negotiate a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. The limitations put in place by the Treasury ensure that almost all of the revenues will come from US tech companies. Only companies with £25m of revenues are covered by the tax, and the list of affected businesses includes Google, Facebook and Amazon. European digital successes such as Spotify and Monzo are excluded because they do not operate “search engines, social media services and online marketplaces”. Washington views any digital taxes as a direct attack on US interests, and said as much to France when it proposed its own version. It also threatened to retaliate with tariffs on wine, cheese, handbags and cookware. There are many details yet to be decided. Zubin Patel, and international tax partner at Deloitte, said: “The government has announced that it will continue to consult on whether the regime should also apply to marketplace delivery fees.” All the carve-outs limit revenue-raising possibilities. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects the tax to raise £280m in its first year in effect, rising to a little over £500m by the end of 2025. The digital sales tax is one of a number of tech-focused measures in the budget. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, also announced billions of pounds in R&D investment, billions more for high-speed broadband and a tax cut for digital media, allowing digital books, newspapers, magazines and academic journals to be sold free of VAT like their print counterparts. Patel believes the tax is likely to be short-lived. “The taxation of the digital economy continues to be a global challenge and the government has again made it clear that it is committed to an OECD-led consensus solution to the problem, at which point the digital services tax will be repealed,” he said."
2020-03-11T18:01:21Z,politics,Politics,Rishi’s wholesale spaffing sends Tories into raptures | John Crace,"Some things are more important than the coronavirus. You’d have thought that once the junior health minister Nadine Dorries had announced she had caught it, some members of the government – Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock among them – might have chosen to self-isolate. For everyone else’s safety as much as their own. Other workplaces have shut down for less. But this was Rishi Sunak’s Big Day Out. A chance for the 16-year-old school prefect doubling as chancellor to splash the cash, to show that the “people’s government” really did care for the lower orders every bit as much as it did for the hedge funds that had bankrolled its election victory. So the entire cabinet squeezed themselves along the front bench to cheer him on. Boris and Matt did their best to look really, really well – “There’s nothing wrong with us, guv” – while Psycho Dominic Raab discreetly coughed into his hands. No one passed him a tissue. Or a face mask. Rather they tried not to look as if they had noticed, while slowly edging themselves away. Keep Calm and Carry On. Ish. Sunak began by announcing £30bn of measures to help the country get through the coronavirus epidemic, a serious amount of cash that rather suggested the government believes the situation is going to be a great deal worse than it has up till now been prepared to let on. Everyone thought it best not to mention the fact that the NHS might be in a far better place if the Tories hadn’t cut public services relentlessly for the past 10 years. The UK has fewer than half the intensive care beds of almost every other EU country. Or that people on zero-hours contracts were still vulnerable. Then we are at a new Year Zero where austerity never happened. The mere mention of George Osborne or Philip Hammond is enough to get you disappeared. A wiser chancellor might have cut his losses after the coronavirus announcements. Just explain we were on the verge of a recession even before we had entered a crisis situation, so there were too many unknowns for any sane economist to make any credible future spending plans. So turn this into an emergency budget, with the promise of a follow-up when he had a clearer picture or what he was dealing with. There again, it might just be handy to have the coronavirus to blame when everything else goes tits up. You win some, you win some. In any case, Rishi had another 45 minutes of Noises Off am-dram theatrics to get through. It’s always the politicians with the least charm and charisma who feel obliged to go on the longest. He waved his arms about, told a couple of shit gags and indulged in a bit of call and response. “We got Brexit done,” he squeaked. “What else are we getting done?” “Absolutely everything,” replied the Tory benches, reading from the Boris hymn sheet. And in a way they were. Boris looked thrilled. Priapic, even. There’s nothing he likes more than wholesale spaffing. After a while even the Tory benches got into the swing of things. If this had been a Labour chancellor announcing the very same measures, the Conservative MPs would have been having a full-on Venezuelan Marxist heart attack, but as it was their boy they collapsed with multiple orgasms. There was no end to Rishi’s rabbits. Literally anything anyone had ever wanted, they could have. Hospitals? As many as you like. Trains, planes and automobiles? Go for it. Schools. Houses. Booze. Toys. Things. Stuff. There wasn’t really a plan for any of this, but there sure was the cash. Not just for infrastructure projects but also for day-to-day spending. Sunak had no idea where any of the money was coming from – it sure as hell wasn’t coming from his own pocket, as he intended to hang on to the fortune he’d made at Goldman Sachs – but the £600 health surcharge on every immigrant was a decent start. The rightwingers in his party would be salivating at the prospect of cracking down on a few foreigners. Who said this wasn’t a budget for everyone? All the chancellor knew was there was unlimited cash for everything. Apart from the things there wasn’t cash for. Just about the only Tory not to enjoy the occasion was Sajid Javid. The former chancellor looked thoroughly miserable throughout. This was Sunak stealing all his best lines. Even the ones about sticking to the fiscal rules with a view to ignoring them at a later date. Rishi was on the up – a possible leader in waiting – while the Saj was going nowhere. Having an unexpected fit of conscience suddenly didn’t look like such a good idea after all. He should have dumped his Spads and taken the glory. As usual, Jeremy Corbyn replied for the opposition. Though he may as well not have bothered. He is already three months past his sell-by date and no one in the Commons pays attention to a word he says. Even Corbyn appears to be bored by Corbyn. He made little effort to engage with anything Sunak had said and just read from his prepared script in a morose monotone. There again, almost no one would care much about the budget by the end of the day. Within hours the World Health Organization had declared the coronavirus to be a global pandemic and that many governments had been too slow to act. The UK being a possible case in point. Sic transit gloria Rishi."
2020-03-11T13:33:29Z,politics,Politics,London Brexit talks in doubt because of coronavirus,"Brexit talks due to take place in London next week have been thrown into doubt because of the coronavirus, Michael Gove has confirmed. Gove told MPs fresh concerns about the second round of talks going ahead as planned had been raised by Brussels counterparts this morning. About 150 delegates from Brussels were due to arrive in London for three days of talks next Wednesday. Gove also said there was a question mark over the inaugural meeting of the EU-UK joint committee, on which he will sit, on 30 March. Asked at the Brexit select committee if talks would be affected by the coronavirus, Gove said: “It’s a live question. We were looking forward to a joint committee in the UK on the 30th and we were also looking forward to the next stage of negotiations going ahead, but we have had indications today from Belgium there may be specific public health concerns.”
It is not clear what the fresh concerns are, but Belgium has confirmed its first death from the virus. Last week two cases of the virus were confirmed by authorities in Brussels, one at the European Defence Agency and another at the Council of the European Union. Gove was answering questions at the first Brexit select committee hearing since the election. He defended the decision not to publish an impact assessment of the EU deal the government is pursuing despite issuing a 60-page assessment last week on the impact a deal with the US would have. “As load-bearing devices go they [impact assessments] are not perhaps the most effective ways of delivering a proper range of views of economic consequences,” he said. As Gove tried to make light of the apparent contradictory positions the government had adopted on impact assessments, he accidentally poured water over his phone and briefing papers.
As head of the exit operations groups and a member of the cabinet’s exit strategy group and member of the EU-UK joint committee, Gove is one of the most powerful government ministers in relation to Brexit. He was grilled by MPs over checks on goods to Northern Ireland and other key subjects on which the UK and the EU have clashed. He declined to answer questions about the checks mandated by the Northern Ireland protocol, saying: “That will be a matter for the joint committee.” His answer appears to underline what sources say is an agreement by both sides to “deal down the rhetoric” to allow negotiators to get on with the challenging task of getting an outline deal by the June deadline for the “stock taking” review of talks. The chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster also confirmed that the UK would produce a legal text of its negotiation position but reserved the right not to publish the text until it saw fit. The EU is also producing a legal text of its position with sources saying that when published the two papers will underline how far apart both sides are on key areas – fisheries, state aid and the level playing field and crime and justice. The Labour MP Stephen Kinnock accused the government of misleading voters during the general election campaign by claiming there was an “oven-ready Brexit” when “in fact it was at the back of the frozen food section” and nowhere near completion. Kinnock put it to Gove that he knew it would be impossible for Britain to get a quota-free and tariff-free deal if it did not accept alignment with the EU on state aid and the level playing field. Gove hit back saying a frozen food version of Brexit would just take “longer for the microwave to ping” and in any case it was possible to get something like the “Marks and Spencer deal you get – a starter, main course and a pudding and you decide which ones you want to get but all for £9.99”."
2020-03-11T12:07:59Z,politics,Politics,Labour anger over Chris Grayling's appointment to intelligence committee,"Labour has demanded that Boris Johnson rethink plans to appoint Chris Grayling to the powerful intelligence and security committee, one of a group of Brexiter Conservatives who will have the final say over whether to release the long-delayed report on Russian influence in UK politics. Nia Griffith, the party’s defence spokesperson, said that previous chairs of the special committee “have been highly qualified and experienced” and “not frightened of criticising the government where and when necessary”. But the Labour MP added that she doubted whether Grayling was sufficiently expert to take on the role, citing “his track record of failure” as transport secretary and justice secretary – and called on the prime minister to “immediately rethink”. The former transport secretary is one of several Tory grandees whose names have emerged as in the frame to be appointed to the watchdog, prompting alarm in Westminster and Whitehall circles. Others include Theresa Villiers, who was environment secretary until the recent reshuffle, and Sir John Hayes, another leave supporter, who would be among nine MPs and peers determining how and whether to release the Russia report. Westminster insiders reacted with dismay at the possibility of Grayling becoming chairman. One Conservative MP said: “He doesn’t have a clue and is likely to be supportive of the government, not critical.” One Whitehall veteran expressed outrage, writing an expletive in a text. Grayling is best known as an error-prone minister who presided over the collapse of Northern and Thameslink rail services and the granting of a no-deal Brexit ferry contract to a company with no ships. As justice secretary, he part-privatised the probation service and banned prisoners from receiving books from relatives – a measure that was overturned in the courts. He was also a prominent supporter of leave in the 2016 referendum campaign.
Downing Street is expected to appoint five Conservative members to the committee, with Grayling’s appointment described as “nailed on”.Other names mentioned as in the running include Mike Penning and Bernard Jenkin. Labour will have a maximum of three and the Scottish National party one. Once selected, the nine members will elect a chair, with a high-profile MP such as Grayling well placed if the Conservative members can agree. Some fear that if the committee has a Brexiter majority it could have an incentive to re-edit the Russia report, which looks at Kremlin influence in British politics, including the impact of meddling in the EU referendum. Dominic Grieve, who chaired the committee in the last parliament, has said the new members should release the report, which has been written, finalised and cleared, without delay once they start sitting – which could yet take a couple of months. “I urge the new members to publish the report as soon as they can,” Grieve said, although he said he expected new members to brief themselves on its contents before it was published and publicly debated. Downing Street was accused of suppressing the Russia report in the run-up to the election. It had been completed and cleared by the spy agencies, but Boris Johnson refused to sign it off until after he won an overall majority in December, prompting accusations that it made for awkward reading for the Conservatives. No 10 insiders, however, insist that the report is far less contentious than political critics have suggested. The report was cleared after the election by Johnson, leaving the decisions over its final release to the new committee. This week, the Guardian published some of the evidence received by the committee, from Bill Browder, an anti-corruption campaigner. He accused Russia of hiring a network of British politicians and consultants to help advance its criminal interests and to “go after” Vladimir Putin’s enemies in London."
2020-03-10T18:51:35Z,politics,Politics,Cabinet secretary betters Sir Humphrey at being utterly opaque | John Crace,"As Matt Hancock was doing a not altogether convincing job of sounding as if he was on top of the coronavirus epidemic during health questions – being led by the scientific evidence increasingly sounds like ministerial code for making policy up on the hoof while trying not to panic – there was at least one part of Westminster that was functioning normally. As in barely functioning at all. For down on the committee corridor, cabinet secretary and senior civil servant Mark Sedwill found himself facing two hours of questions from the public administration and constitutional affairs select committee. Here was the perfect calm. A man who has never knowingly given a helpful or straight answer to anyone. Indeed Sedwill would consider it a gross dereliction of duty to be anything other than thoroughly opaque. To be forgotten is the highest compliment he can be paid. And a committee that – with a couple of notable exceptions – was hell-bent on finding out absolutely nothing of any interest at all costs. Not just by passive negligence but also by active design. On several occasions it felt as if the committee was alarmed Sedwill might accidentally say something noteworthy and tried to warn him off. Not that he required their help. The tone was set by chair William “Wet” Wragg. Quite how this Conservative MP has come to be in charge of this committee is one of life’s mysteries. It’s not just that he appears to have little personality – no one can remember him making a single telling contribution in the five years he has been in parliament – but also because he seems to be almost entirely without intellectual curiosity. Every day is a wondrous new beginning for him where he wakes up astonished to find he is an MP – an astonishment that is shared by those who know him best – and his first instinct is to ask for instructions on what to do next. Anything for a quiet life. Wragg opened with a mumbled observation about bullying on the whole not being a very good thing. He sounded apologetic for bringing up such a potentially embarrassing subject and keen to move on to something less challenging. Sedwill agreed that everyone could probably do a bit better and it might be an idea to introduce some coaching for ministers to help them tone down the bullying a bit. It was all kept deliberately vague and impersonal as no one was keen to mention the specific allegations against the home secretary, Priti Patel. Because that would be awkward for all concerned and might raise tricky questions. Tory David Jones was keen to point out that it was very hard to differentiate between robust discussion and bullying and that the benefit of the doubt should always go to the minister. Besides, rather than create a fuss, why not ship out a civil servant who objected to being bullied and employ one who responded well to it instead. Fellow Conservative John Stevenson nodded eagerly. Quite right. Ministers should be allowed to choose their yes men and women. Sedwill, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Sir Humphrey as it is, responded by quoting directly from Yes, Minister. The whole job of being a civil servant was to keep the chips up rather than being forced into difficult situations when the chips were down. It was hard to know if he was just taking the piss out of the committee for being so hopeless or whether he always talked like this. Probably a bit of both. In any case he found another way of filling five minutes while saying precisely nothing. It took a while, but the SNP’s Ronnie Cowan and Labour’s Lloyd Russell-Moyle did eventually raise the unprecedented public resignation of home office permanent secretary Philip Rutnam and the various allegations agains Patel. But they too rather succumbed to the inevitable futility and faded into unconsciousness. Too long in Wragg’s company can do that to you. Sedwill merely batted away any direct questions by saying he couldn’t comment as legal proceedings were ongoing. Not that he would have even if they weren’t. So no one ever got round to getting to the bottom of the key issues. Such as whether Rutnam had gone to Sedwill before his resignation. Whether Sedwill thought there had been a breach of the ministerial code. Whether Rutnam had had any run-ins with previous ministers. And whether Sedwill had warned Boris Johnson about Patel’s previous. In fact, all the things the cabinet secretary had been summoned before the committee to answer. Much the same negative energy hung over the rest of the session. This was the select committee as anti-matter. What could have been a tricky few minutes on the recruitment of “weirdos and misfits” as special advisers passed off with Sedwill saying nothing was anything to do with him. He wasn’t even prepared to say whether it was Boris or Dominic Cummings who had ultimately been responsible for recruiting a eugenicist. Well above his pay grade. As indeed it appears to be above everyone’s. Eventually Wet Wragg drew the proceedings to a close. This had been an extremely useful session, he said, precisely because no one had learned anything. Sedwill could only agree. It had taken years of training to learn how to be this counter-productive. Sir Humphrey would have been proud of him."
2020-03-10T17:52:49Z,politics,Politics,Johnson's majority slashed as 38 Tory rebels fire warning shot over Huawei's involvement in 5G - as it happened,"Boris Johnson is under pressure to announce a firm deadline for the removal of Huawei from the UKâ€™s 5G network after 38 Tory MPs rebelled in a vote on the issue, slashing his majority by almost three quarters. The PM still won the division reasonably comfortably, but he should have a working majority of 87, and instead he won by just 24. (See 3.57pm.) All opposition parties apart from the DUP backed the rebel amendment, tabled by the former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, that was intended to stop the government using Huawei in 5G from 2023. Duncan Smith, who thinks the Chinese firm is a threat to UK national security, said that he was flexible about the deadline, but that he did want the government to set at timescale for the removal of Huawei from the network. Ministers have said that they will cap Huaweiâ€™s involvement in 5G at 35%, and that they want to lower this cap over time, as other supply options become available. In the debate Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, said that the government would bring forward a telecommunications security bill by the summer, which MPs could amend, and that the government was committed to working with Five Eyes partners (ie, intelligence allies) on developing an alternative to Huawei during this parliament. (See 2.48pm.) At one stage it looked as if the Dowden concessions had been choreographed to match the Duncan Smith demands and that Duncan Smith might withdraw his amendment. But during the debate Dowden failed to give Tory MPs the verbal assurances that they wanted, and Duncan Smith decided to force a vote. (See 3.03pm.) The government is under growing pressure to toughen up its coronavirus response as the number of confirmed cases in the UK rose to 373 and a sixth death was announced. There is full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak on our special live blog here.
Ministers should behave professionally and courteously when dealing with civil servants and could be given training if they fail to do so, Sir Mark Sedwill, the UKâ€™s most senior civil servant, has told MPs. The chancellor must use the budget on Wednesday to announce an emergency stimulus package to help the economy cope with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, according to one of Britainâ€™s biggest investment companies. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments."
2020-03-10T17:45:57Z,politics,Politics,Government majority cut as almost 40 Tories rebel over Huawei,"Thirty-eight Tory MPs have rebelled against the government in an unsuccessful attempt to force Boris Johnson to set out a timetable for excluding Huawei from future 5G phone networks. The government’s majority was cut to 24 as the rebels were defeated by 306 to 282 on an amendment put down by former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, amid concerns over the presence of a Chinese supplier at the heart of Britain’s digital infrastructure. Had another 13 MPs joined the anti-Huawei revolt, Johnson would have suffered an embarrassing defeat just three months after his comprehensive success in December’s general election. But the narrow margin of victory is a warning shot to Downing Street, which still has to legislate to implement its plan for a 35% cap on Huawei in 5G in the early summer, although 44 would be needed to have a chance of defeating the government. Conservative rebels voting against the government included former cabinet ministers David Davis, Iain Duncan Smith, Liam Fox, Damian Green, Esther McVey, Owen Paterson and John Redwood. Others joining them included ERG chair Mark Francois, and Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs committee. But five DUP MPs voted with the government. The rebels wanted the government to eliminate Huawei ideally by the end of 2022, but Iain Duncan Smith signalled he was willing to consider alternative dates, in an attempt to reach an agreement with ministers over the issue. “We need to know that it is the government’s intention to rid ourselves of high-risk vendors such as Huawei,” Duncan Smith said, and “to commence the beginnings of that retraction before the end of this parliament.”. But despite being repeatedly pressed by unhappy backbenchers, Dowden refused to give any timetable for eliminating Huawei from future 5G networks and even appeared to row back on previous commitments for eliminating Huawei at all. “We’re not in a position today to set out a specific date or timetable for reaching no high-risk vendors, that would require a new decision to be taken by the National Security Council,” Dowden told parliament. Labour and the SNP backed the Tory rebels, although the vote over an amendment to the telecoms infrastructure bill was technically symbolic, because the bill itself was focused on giving broadband providers access to buildings owned by recalcitrant leaseholders. Dowden’s offer to the rebels was a promise that the UK would work with the US, Australia and other members of the English speaking Five Eyes intelligence community to “develop new supply chain capacity” – competitors to Huawei - which he said would take place over the course of the current parliament, by the middle of 2024. But the lack of clarity was not enough for the rebel backbenchers. One frustrated Conservative, former environment secretary Owen Paterson, said that Dowden was “tantalisingly close” to giving them what they wanted. “All we need now is a commitment there will be a date,” to eliminating Huawei, Paterson added. Last month, Boris Johnson’s government announced plans to cap Huawei’s market share in 5G at 35%. The rebels want the UK to eliminate the Chinese company’s involvement entirely, even though it has been used in British networks since 2003. The White House and the rebels believe technology from the Chinese firm represents a potential surveillance risk, but Downing Street and Britain’s spy agencies believe any risks can be managed, based partly on their experience of the kit. Dowden also said that members of the National Cyber Security Centre, an arm of GCHQ, would give evidence to select committees inquiring into Huawei and the telecoms supply chain for the first time in their history. Earlier, Sir Mike Rake, a former chairman of BT Group, who is now an adviser to Huawei, warned: “Any attempt to further restrict Huawei 5G equipment, or to remove existing 4G equipment will not only incur very significant costs, but prejudice trade relationships with China and will significantly set back the government’s broadband ambitions.”"
2020-03-10T12:32:27Z,politics,Politics,"Ministers should be courteous to officials, says top civil servant","Ministers should behave professionally and courteously when dealing with civil servants and could be given training if they fail to do so, the UK’s most senior civil servant has told MPs. Giving evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee, Sir Mark Sedwill said he could not comment directly on allegations of bullying against the home secretary, Priti Patel, who has been accused of verbally abusing staff in three government departments. The cabinet secretary said, however, that there was an expectation ministers should conduct themselves properly and try to get the best out of their civil servants. He agreed that they could be sent for training if they had difficulties managing staff. “That is the most effective way of delivering the government’s agenda. If it doesn’t work then it doesn’t work and we will take whatever the appropriate action might be,” he said. The committee questioned Sedwill about the resignation last week of Sir Philip Rutnam as the Home Office’s permanent secretary. Rutnam plans to sue the government for constructive dismissal after a series of clashes with Patel. Part of his case is expected to include allegations that she bullied several civil servants in the department. She is also alleged to have mistreated staff in the Department for International Development and the Department for Work and Pensions. Senior Conservatives have argued for a new definition of bullying to be written into the ministerial code to avoid similar clashes in the future. Sedwill told MPs he did not think a more formal process was needed to allow permanent secretaries to air grievances about a minister’s conduct, and he described the fallout between Rutnam and Patel as regrettable. Asked whether the “informality of the process was wanting”, he replied: “I don’t think so because I think this is clearly a very regrettable incident. I regret Philip Rutnam’s decision to resign and hoped it could have been avoided. We have to allow that case and indeed the other investigation to take their course. “I don’t think we should necessarily try to write further regulations around relationships when the vast majority of cases are conducted professionally and in accordance with both the letter and the spirit of the various codes. There are tensions and differences, we deal with those when they arise. In general, I think the mechanisms we have available to us are adequate to the task. “Our expectation is that these are professional people, as in any big organisation. The job of the civil service is to support ministers, build a relationship of confidence and trust with them.” Sedwill declined to share the advice he had given the prime minister over the row. Asked whether it would still be regarded a private matter at an employment tribunal, he said: “I don’t know, I’d have to seek advice of legal counsel in those circumstances. But I would not expect at all for private advice between the cabinet secretary and the prime minister to be subject to that kind of procedure.” MPs asked Sedwill about remarks by Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s key aide, that the government would benefit from having more “weirdos and misfits” in its ranks. He said: “Anything that widens the aperture of public service … I think is a good thing.” Asked about the government’s decision to hire Andrew Sabisky, who stood down as a No 10 adviser after it was disclosed that he had argued that intelligence was linked to race, Sedwill said Sabisky was a contractor, not a special adviser, and would have been subject to security vetting. “There is a distinction between someone with controversial views and someone who is a national security risk,” he said. Following controversy over the recruitment and dismissal of special advisers – Cummings is reported to have taken control of all politically appointed ministerial advisers, much to their anger – Sedwill said “only the prime minister” was able to hire and fire them."
2020-03-09T21:05:52Z,politics,Politics,Johnson's coronavirus press conference is anything but reassuring | John Crace,"There may come a time when an emergency press conference actually reassures someone, but we’re a long way off as yet. Quite the reverse, in fact. When Boris Johnson had lined up with the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, at Downing Street last Tuesday the mood had been notably more relaxed. Though Boris had tried to look serious when doing his familiar front-of-house “business as usual” act, he’d still found time for a few light-hearted gaffes and gags. And Whitty and Vallance had appeared to be thoroughly enjoying their unexpected turn in the spotlight as the country’s favourite experts. A week on, and the three amigos were back in the same state room at No 10. But this time there were no smiles and even fewer words of reassurance. Even the hitherto imperturbable Whitty looked flushed and sweaty as he tried to choose his words carefully, while Boris appeared to have aged years. This wasn’t the job he signed up for last year. He liked being the bearer of good tidings – mostly out of a need to distance himself from his own despair and destruction. He was the Mr Fun Guy prime minister. The gaslighter-in-chief who could say, “Get Brexit done” and people would believe it despite it obviously being bollocks. The current crisis was a whole new ball game. No amount of saying “We’re getting coronavirus done” would cut it. There was only so much bullshit the public would take. Now was the time he had to drop the ersatz charm and show genuine leadership. And his self-doubt was all too visible. Unsurprising, as one key message was to behave responsibly and think of others – two things Boris has seldom done. This was much too real for Boris, too hard. He bounced nervously from foot to foot and his eyes darted around the room for signs of comfort from the assembled reporters. His unease rubbed off on everyone. You could feel the tension in the room. It was soon apparent that no one actually had anything new to say. They just felt the need to be visible and say pretty much the same things as before, only in a slightly more panicky tone of voice. People should basically carry on doing what they had been doing before, they said. We were still in the containment phase, even though Whitty had told last Thursday’s health select committee that he thought we had now moved into stage two of “mainly delay”. It was beginning to look as if there was not much difference between containment and delay after all. The main message appeared to be that everyone knew that the situation was going to get much worse, but the plan was to do nothing different until it had actually got worse, so most of the questions focused on why we weren’t doing more now. If we knew the UK was going to find itself in the same situation in two weeks’ time that Italy is now in, why not try to get ahead of the curve and implement some of the more extreme measures the Italian government had already implemented? Surely that must save more lives? Here we saw the coronavirus crisis for what it was. A brutal numbers game of damage limitation. There was no point yet banning large gatherings – bad news for Spurs’ season ticket holders, who had been hoping both for a decent refund and being spared the horrors of watching the team try to play football – or even small ones. Partly because it had little effect on transmission in the early stages of an epidemic. But mostly because if you introduced these measures too soon, then people got bored of them when it really counted and ignored them. Only it was a numbers game with no numbers. At least none to which Johnson, Whitty or Vallance were prepared to commit. Asked if he agreed with the Scottish chief medical officer’s suggestion that 4% of those infected – a possible two million people – could need hospital treatment, Whitty became unusually vague. Boris merely said he was sure the NHS would continue to do a marvellous job. No one thought it the right time to remind him just how many hospital beds the Tories had cut in the last 10 years. “It’s time for a national effort,” he said. “The country must pull together. We know how to defeat this and we will.” We just had no idea of the expected casualties. Earlier in the afternoon, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was also coming under a little more pressure when forced to answer an urgent question on the coronavirus epidemic. Up till now, all parties had been prepared to cut the government some slack – a genuine coming together at a time of a national emergency. Now, though, there was a feeling on all benches that it was a time to get real and stop talking in generalities. Labour’s shadow health secretary demanded to know what the actual budgets for the NHS were. Jeremy Hunt asked for the government’s estimated casualties. Hilary Benn wanted to know how many ventilators there were and how many staff were trained to use them. Tigger had no answers. Then again, neither does anyone else. At least, none that they are prepared to share with us."
2020-03-09T18:11:14Z,politics,Politics,"Containment of virus 'extremely unlikely to work on its own', says Boris Johnson – as it happened","Here are the main points from the press conference held by Boris Johnson. He was joined by Prof Chris Whitty, the governmentâ€™s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the governmentâ€™s chief scientific adviser. Ministers will within a fortnight advise anyone with a fever or a mild respiratory tract infection to stay at home for seven days, Whitty revealed. He said that the government was not giving out this advice now, because the chances of someone with a fever now having coronavirus are very low, he said. But he said that would change very quickly. Soon the number of infections would rise â€œreally quite fastâ€�, he said. He went on: We are now very close to the time, probably within the next 10 to 14 days, when the modelling would imply we should move to a situation where everybody with even minor respiratory tract infections or a fever should be self-isolating for a period of seven days. This advice is likely to have huge repercussions for workplaces across the country. Johnson stressed that it was important for the government not to implement its delay and mitigating measures too early. He said: It is absolutely critical in managing the spread of this virus that we take the right decisions at the right time based on the latest and the best evidence, so we mustnâ€™t do things which have no or limited medical benefit, nor things which could turn out actually to be counter-productive. He sounded more defensive on this point than he was when he held a press conference last week, reflecting the fact that the government is starting to face criticism for allegedly being too complacent. Johnson said that he was no longer shaking hands. Last week he was still shaking hands, but he said at todayâ€™s Commonwealth Day service he was advised against this. He explained: We were all given an instruction not to shake hands and thereâ€™s a good reason for not shaking hands, which is that the behavioural psychologists say that if you donâ€™t shake somebodyâ€™s hand then that sends an important message to them about the importance of washing your hands. So thereâ€™s a subliminal cue there to everybody to wash your hands, which is, I think Iâ€™m right in saying ... far more important. Whitty refused to comment on suggestions that 2m people might be hospitalised. He said figures like this were â€œlargely speculativeâ€�. Whitty said that from tomorrow the government would start screening everyone arriving at hospital with a respiratory illness for coronavirus. Until now people have only been screened if they are in intensive care and have coronavirus-type symptoms, he said. Vallance said the aim of the measures to be introduced by the government would be to lower the mortality rate of those in the at-risk group by 20 to 30%. But he said it would be wrong to try to â€œsuppressâ€� the disease completely because it could result in a winter outbreak at a time of maximum pressure for the NHS. He said: What you canâ€™t do is suppress this thing completely, and what you shouldnâ€™t do is suppress it completely because all that happens then is it pops up again later in the year when the NHS is at a more vulnerable stage in the winter and you end up with another problem. Thatâ€™s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments."
2020-03-09T16:17:23Z,politics,Politics,Glasgow activist risks arrest to set up drug consumption room in a van,"A community activist will risk arrest to set up a safe injecting facility in the back of a van for addicts in Glasgow, in a desperate attempt to break the political deadlock around drug consumption rooms. Peter Krykant has already raised over £2,000 within days of announcing his plan to purchase a vehicle and customise it as a mobile safer-injecting suite. It will offer clean water, needles and swabs, as well as supplies of naloxone, the potentially life-saving drug that reverses the effects of opioid overdose, as a means of combating the soaring drug deaths and HIV infection rates across the city. While similar set-ups have been credited with saving lives around the world, it remains illegal to facilitate drug use in this way in the UK. Krykant launched his fundraising appeal last week after his building frustration at political inertia over Scotland’s escalating drug deaths was compounded by the lacklustre government summits that took place in Glasgow last week, at which the UK crime minister, Kit Malthouse, described drug consumption rooms as “a distraction”. Glasgow city council, backed by the Scottish government, has been calling for legal powers to pilot such a scheme for years, but with drug laws reserved to Westminster, the Home Office has consistently dismissed the proposal. Krykant explained: “The conferences were the final straw, and the fact that it is being used as a political football. Both governments are guilty; the UK is saying it’s just not going to happen, and the Scottish government is making it sound like a silver bullet and all the fault of Westminster. “I accept that much more needs to be done for addicts – people coming to a drug consumption room need onward referrals and access to opiate substitution treatment or rehab beds – but we’ve got to start somewhere. “People who use drugs like heroin are injecting in squalid conditions in alleyways and parks, there’s a risk to public with injecting equipment strewn everywhere, and an ongoing HIV outbreak amongst addicts. We are trying to provide a safe place for people to come, but also give them an opportunity to engage with outreach workers, who can give wound care, harm reduction advice or referrals to other services.” Krykant’s original Just Giving page was shut down because it breached the site’s regulations, but donations are continuing to flood in via a new PayPal page. Following publicity around his plans to challenge the law, he lost his job with an HIV outreach charity, but Krykant, himself a recovered addict, remains undeterred. “What we’re talking about is against the law, but I am prepared to take that risk. If it means I have to be arrested for providing an internationally recognised, evidence-based approach to help people stay alive, so be it.” Police Scotland’s Greater Glasgow division recently committed to supporting a public health approach to tackling drug-related deaths, and a number of senior figures have indicated their support for a legal consumption room. Krykant’s civil disobedience has also been publicly backed by Brian Casey, the campaigning Church of Scotland minister who spoke passionately at the UK summit last week about the escalating numbers of drug-related funerals he conducts in his north Glasgow church, and has now written to the police and Crown Office calling for an amnesty for those “trying their best to plug a gap the state should have covered”. Casey has pledged to volunteer at the van, as has the former Labour MP Paul Sweeney, whose constituency included Casey’s parish. Karyn McCluskey, co-founder of Glasgow’s renowned Violence Reduction unit and now head of Community Justice Scotland, this week visited Copenhagen in Denmark, where five drug consumption rooms support thousands of users. This harm prevention work began with a mobile van like the one proposed by Krykant. McCluskey says that, while she cannot support someone breaking the law, she believes strongly that the UK and Scottish governments should find common cause over a pilot DCR. “This is not just a Scottish issue, it’s UK-wide. We need to keep people alive before we can get them into recovery. We won’t get it right the first time, and we need to involve those we want to help in their development, but we can’t be still sitting here in a year’s time saying, ‘We really must do something.’”"

Thousands of women and allies gathered in cities across the world to protest for women’s rights and protection against violence. Demonstrations were seen in over a dozen countries, from Pakistan to Argentina. For some, the risks of protesting were great. In many cities, women were often met with counter-protestors, sometimes in the form of riot police who used tear gas to disperse crowds. No matter the risk, women showed up and demanded to be heard, showing the fight for rights will continue well past this day for women."
2020-03-08T18:36:39Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer declines to rule out campaigning to rejoin EU,"Keir Starmer, the Labour leadership frontrunner, has declined to rule out campaigning to rejoin the EU in the years ahead, saying it was a question for future generations. The shadow Brexit secretary said he did not think it was a “priority for now and the immediate future” and has previously said the question of leaving the EU is over. But when pressed to rule out advocating rejoining the EU in future, he said: “It’s for our kids to decide what our future relationship is.” Starmer was the only candidate not to rule out campaigning to reverse Brexit at a Labour hustings hosted by the Mirror in Dudley. Rebecca Long-Bailey was the candidate who posed the question to her two leadership rivals and she ruled it out herself. Lisa Nandy said: “I’d rule it out. We haven’t got the option, we’ve lost that right because we didn’t take the deal that ticked every box that we had about protecting close economic and political cooperation. We refused to do it.”
Starmer was instrumental in shifting Labour’s position in favour of a second referendum before the election. But he told the hustings that the party’s Brexit policy had not been the main factor in its election defeat. He told the hustings that if people think “we were cruising to victory but for Brexit then I’ll suggest they weren’t out there campaigning”. Starmer has previously said: “I don’t think there’s really any question of rejoining the EU. We’ve just left the EU. The leave-remain debate is over. The divide is over and we need to let it go. All of us, whichever way we voted.”"
2020-03-08T16:31:12Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson heckled as a 'traitor' while visiting flood-hit Worcestershire,"Boris Johnson has been met with cries of “traitor” after arriving in flood-hit Worcestershire more than three weeks after the crisis began. The prime minister arrived on the banks of the River Severn in Bewdley on Sunday afternoon, and was taken to view flood defences by Environment Agency staff. However, some members of the public heckled Johnson in fury that he has stayed away from the affected areas until now – instead spending the half-term break in one of the government’s grace-and-favour mansions in Kent. Johnson told residents he would “get Bewdley done” and said he was “so sorry to hear it” when he was told that some homes had been overwhelmed by as much as 2ft of water. He later tweeted a video of him surrounded by well-wishers and those who wanted selfies. As he walked around the town, many asked to shake his hand and shouted friendly greetings, but one person heckled him with “do your fucking job”.
After speaking to the Environment Agency officials, he said they discussed “what permanent defences can we put in and what’s the business case”. He added: “What we’re doing is we are doubling the funding for flood defences to £5.2bn, and we’re also going to be looking at all the things we can do upstream.” The extra money for flood defences is due to be announced at Wednesday’s budget by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor. He will say flood defence spending will increase from £2.6bn to £5.2bn between 2015 and 2021, giving protection to 336,000 homes in England through 2,000 new schemes. However, Johnson’s reluctance to visit flood-hit areas himself has led to criticism from Labour that he is a “part-time prime minister”. Last week, the prime minister claimed he had been advised to stay away by emergency services in case he got in the way. Speaking to ITV’s This Morning, he said: “They [the emergency services] said to us: ‘All you’ll do is distract us and disrupt the business of helping people with the immediate crisis.’ So what I was doing was directing operations … Obviously, I’m working around the clock on various things, as indeed is the government.” Critics have pointed out that he found time to visit flooded areas of the north of England during the election campaign when he was seeking votes."
2020-03-08T15:46:25Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak took part in controversial US corporate raid case,"The new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was part of a small team of hedge fund managers criticised by a US court for covertly acquiring an interest in a Wall Street-listed firm while working on a 2007 corporate raiding deal. Sunak was a partner of The Children’s Investment (TCI) fund when it threatened to “go to war” with the board of the American rail freight operator CSX, where the tactics included pledging to topple the company’s board after the hedge fund had surprised directors by amassing a secret interest.
The hedge fund is one of the City’s best-known “activist” investors, meaning it often tries to use its financial muscle to force firms to change their management or strategy. TCI’s acquisition of its CSX stake, which included shares and financial derivatives that give economic returns similar to shares, was ruled by a US judge to have breached US securities rules, although TCI the successfully appealed against the judgment. In the original judgment, the judge said the financiers had attempted to “seek to defend their secret accumulation of interests in CSX by invoking what they assert is the letter of the law. Much of their position in CSX was in the form of … a type of derivative that gave defendants substantially all of the indicia of stock ownership save the formal legal right to vote the shares. In consequence, they argue, they did not beneficially own the shares.” The appeal court also sent part of the case back to the lower court so it could further consider whether the investment in the derivatives had breached any law, but CSX then abandoned its claim. The moves to use the CSX stake to replace the directors were documented in minutes taken to record a meeting in June 2007 between advisors to CSX and TCI, which was attended by Sunak, TCI founder Sir Christopher Hohn, and TCI partner Snehal Amin.
The document, sent by the advisors to CSX, stated: “TCI indicated that they fully intend to ‘go to war’. When asked what that means they indicated that they would seek to replace the entire board as a means to change management.” A Treasury spokeswoman said: “TCI had highlighted failures in corporate governance, safety and performance at CSX and were ultimately successful in convincing shareholders to vote for their board nominees rather than the management’s nominees.” Following the campaign, CSX shares declined, prompting TCI to sell its stake and take its directors off the board. TCI did not respond to invitations to comment."
2020-03-08T15:46:17Z,politics,Politics,Rishi Sunak: the bit-part hedge fund partner now managing the economy,"For those fretting that the UK economy is about to crash in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, there is some solace. Rishi Sunak has a history of staying up all night worrying about his charges’ financial wellbeing. The new chancellor, who is preparing to deliver his first budget this week, is now running a £2tn economy in which every member of the country has a stake. But the 39-year-old claims that mere hundred-million-pound decisions once caused him sleepless nights in his former life as a hedge fund manager, as he attempted to stem his clients’ losses during the financial crisis.
The stress Sunak admits to during his time in the City is instructive as – alongside Star Wars films, former Southampton football Matthew Le Tissier and Yorkshire Tea – the chancellor says finance is among his main loves. “You are highly accountable. That’s what I like about it,” he told the BBC’s Political Thinking podcast last year as he related tales from his time in the City. “You are responsible for your investments and either they’re good or they’re bad … There are not many other people to blame, there’s nowhere to hide.” Yet despite his insistence that his career is on display, Sunak has hidden from sight incredibly effectively.
When appointed chancellor last month, he was widely said to have risen without trace. Ask around the City, and it’s difficult to find many people who have come across him. Those who have talk of a “very bright”, “polite” and considered financier who had little of the ego associated with that trade. “He is always very, very well turned out,” said one, but few can give details of a City career that Sunak had left by his early 30s. Sunak is the eldest son of a Hindu family who immigrated from India (both sets of his grandparents with their children), and Sunak’s parents went on to carve out professional careers: his father worked as a GP and his mother as a pharmacist, who acquired her own pharmacy business. Sunak showed an early interest in the mechanics of trade by doing her bookkeeping. Sunak went on to become head boy at Winchester College before going on to study philosophy, politics and economics (PPE) at Oxford University. But despite gaining a first in the traditional politician’s degree, he rejected student politics and instead devoted his spare time to his fascination with money, becoming president of the Oxford University Investment Society, where members received talks from real-life bankers and competed in financial trading games. Almost inevitably, that led him to the Square Mile in 2001 and the most revered – some say hated – of investment banks, Goldman Sachs, effectively working as a graduate trainee for three years. Sunak left there to do an MBA at Stanford in the US, where he met his wife, Akshata Murty, the daughter of NR Narayana Murty, the billionaire founder of the global IT firm Infosys. Then it was back to the City, with Sunak moving into hedge funds by joining the Children’s Investment (TCI) Fund, which proved a controversial choice. The fund, created by one of the City’s best-known managers, Sir Christopher Hohn, is set up like many hedge funds, including basing its funds in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. But it is also regarded as an “activist” investor, meaning it often tries to use its financial muscle to force companies to change their management or strategy. Most infamously, TCI launched a campaign against the Dutch bank ABN Amro in 2007, which resulted in its sale to the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). The deal loaded RBS with crippling debt and led to a £45.5bn government bailout. The Treasury says Sunak played no role in that deal, but as chancellor he is now ultimately responsible for managing the taxpayer holding in the bank. Sunak was directly involved in other activist campaigns, including a bitter one against the US rail freight group CSX, which ended up with TCI being criticised for its lack of disclosure about its interest in the firm, in a judgment that was then successfully appealed against. His time as a junior partner at the fund would have meant he was very well paid, although nowhere near the levels of more senior partners.
But around the time of the financial crisis, TCI split. Patrick Degorce, a co-founder with Hohn, left to start his own fund called Thélème Partners, taking Sunak with him to work in America, where he invested in companies including News Corp and the US hospital group Community Health Systems. Like Hohn, Degorce proved to be a controversial boss. In 2013 he was forced to part with millions of pounds in tax after a ruling concerning a personal investment in a complex film financing scheme, which sought to shelter earnings of almost £19m. The Treasury minister at the time, David Gauke, said the structure was a “dubious avoidance scheme”. Still, Sunak appears to know his own mind when picking investments in this sector. Before he became an MP, Catamaran Ventures – an investment firm he founded with his wife – acquired a stake in a company called Acamar Films, which makes the children’s TV programme Bing for the BBC. A fellow shareholder is the comedian Jimmy Carr – who is no stranger to tax controversies himself – and the company has benefited from investments made by people receiving tax breaks via the government’s Enterprise Investment Scheme. However, unlike Degorce’s efforts, the tax breaks on the Acamar investment look to have had a proper purpose, with the company now employing 67 people. It is an investment that appears consistent with Sunak’s view of the world – one that appears traditionally Tory, with tax breaks seen as a pragmatic method to encourage trade. That is a theme that shaped Sunak’s initial policy work, as well as his early backing of Brexit.
In 2016 he wrote a paper for the free-market thinktank the Centre for Policy Studies, advocating the use of freeports, in which he argued for the UK to establish a series of free-trade zones around the country where components can be imported, used to manufacture finished goods, which are then exported without incurring domestic duties. Tellingly, the paper was full of references to what is now called “levelling up” and entitled The Free Ports Opportunity: how Brexit could boost trade, manufacturing and the north. The north was by then an obvious focus, after Sunak had won the former seat of another former Tory rising star – William Hague’s Richmond in North Yorkshire – where Sunak has joked that his family now accounted for the constituency’s entire intake of immigrants. Despite not drinking alcohol and not eating beef, which might have caused the odd eyebrow to arch among local beef farmers, he seems to have been a popular choice with the local party, which respects what is said to be a healthy work ethic. One local Conservative said: “He won it on his merits. People often unfairly say in these situations that he was pushed by Central Office, parachuted in because he was a BAME candidate, or whatever. It was just not true in his case in Richmond. They love him there.”"
2020-03-08T10:39:29Z,politics,Politics,Layla Moran to stand for Liberal Democrat leadership,"Layla Moran has revealed she plans to run for leadership of the Liberal Democrats, saying the party needs to “move on from the last decade”. The former teacher, who has been an MP since 2017, would mark a break from the party’s years in coalition with the Tories from 2010 to 2015. Speaking on Sky’s Ridge on Sunday, the MP for Oxford West and Abingdon said she would put climate change and electoral reform at the heart of her agenda. “I want to lead and empower the Liberal Democrats to fight for this future and to grow our support, so that we can make people’s lives better. I want the party to be in a position to win power within a generation, so that we can bring about the change our country so desperately needs,” she said. Moran, who recently came out as pansexual, has previously been critical of former leader Jo Swinson, saying the 2019 election campaign was “arrogant”. She had been expected to run for the leadership in 2019 but withdrew after it emerged she had slapped her then boyfriend in 2013 at the party’s conference. Her rivals are likely to include Ed Davey, the former energy secretary, who is currently acting leader and lost out to Swinson in 2019. The first candidate to declare was Wera Hobhouse, the MP for Bath since 2017, who entered the race saying she wanted a “clean break” with the coalition era. Other potential candidates include Daisy Cooper, the St Albans MP, who has only been an MP since December."
2020-03-08T09:05:30Z,politics,Politics,Lisa Nandy demands answers over missing Labour leadership ballots,"Lisa Nandy has written to Labour’s general secretary, Jennie Formby, asking for urgent reassurance about the conduct of the party’s leadership contest, amid growing controversy over why many party members have yet to receive their ballot papers. The MP for Wigan, who has reached the final stage of the contest along with Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey, is concerned that many of those affected by delays are among the 100,000 new members who have joined since Labour’s general election defeat in December. According to senior party figures, the new members – who, polling suggests, would be more likely to vote for Starmer or Nandy than Long-Bailey, who is backed by the Corbynite left – are being subject to extra verification processes, including checking their addresses against the electoral register. Such checks, it is believed, are not being carried out on longer-established members. The delays, however, have also hit many members who joined before Jeremy Corbyn became leader in 2015. The former lord chancellor Charlie Falconer, who on Saturday had still not received his ballot papers, said serious questions had to be asked: “The number of people complaining about not receiving their ballot papers gives me real anxiety that there is a high level of incompetence here – or perhaps something worse.”
One source close to one of the leadership campaigns said: “We think this is part cock-up, part conspiracy. It is very striking that a very high proportion of those who have not got their papers are either people who joined before 2015, so before Corbyn was leader, or since the general election – so these are people less likely to back a Corbyn continuity candidate.” The source added: “Many of those who joined after the election were encouraged to do so by [former leadership candidate] Jess Phillips before she pulled out. After she did so, they are by definition likely to have switched to Keir or Lisa.” Former deputy leader Dame Margaret Beckett, who sits on Labour’s national executive committee (NEC), said she was mystified by the delays: “I know of people both in my family and my constituency who have not had their ballot papers – and this is inexplicable, in that some of these people have been party members for more than 50 years.” In her letter to Formby – the most senior official in the party – Nandy has demanded answers to a series of questions, including how many members who applied to join since the election in December have not yet passed the electoral register check. She also wants to know if the same checks have been carried out on people who were already members before the election, and if not why not; and what the position will be for members who are under 18 and who as a result will not be on the electoral register. In addition, she wants to know why the party considers it “appropriate” to put new “barriers in front of new members joining the party in this election, but not in previous contests” and has asked Formby if the NEC was consulted on the new system. The ballot opened on 21 February, and closes on 2 April. It is understood that the full NEC held only a brief discussion of how to manage the leadership contest in January. It is understood that issues relating to membership of the party were placed under the control of Corbyn’s close ally Karie Murphy following the election defeat. A party source said the ballot was being conducted by Civica, formerly Electoral Reform Services, which has more than 100 years’ experience of conducting elections. They said Civica was “satisfied” with how the process was going. They also said new members were being checked against the electoral register because the party wanted the election to be as fair and democratic as possible and this was a way of ensuring people could not register fake or multiple names."
2020-03-07T20:11:47Z,politics,Politics,Tories ‘must spend £33bn more a year’ to reach zero emissions by 2050,"Boris Johnson’s government must spend an additional £33bn a year on measures to tackle the climate emergency if it is to meet its target of cutting carbon of emissions to zero by 2050, according to a detailed analysis published on Sunday. Investment in low-carbon transport – including more infrastructure for charging electric vehicles, improved railways and better facilities for cyclists – would have to rise by £12bn a year, and spending on low-carbon homes and other buildings would need to be increased by £10bn annually. The huge sums of extra spending required have been produced before Wednesday’s budget by the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, which says the necessary measures would not only help tackle climate change but would also deliver an economic boost and help Johnson’s ambition to “level up” the country. Last summer the government signed into law a commitment requiring the UK to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero, replacing the previous pledge to reduce them by at least 80% compared with 1990 levels. But the IPPR argues in its study that in order to do so ministers will have to loosen their own fiscal rules, which cap borrowing for investment at 3% of GDP annually. The former Labour leader Ed Miliband, a co-chair of the IPPR’s environmental justice commission, said the budget needed to put climate change at its heart. “This will take investment but making these decisions will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, improve our natural environment, cut air pollution and make Britain a better place to love,” he said. “It makes economic and environmental sense.” In order to hit net zero within 30 years, the UK will need to be running on renewable energy with industry using mostly carbon-free processes. All homes and other buildings will have to be fully insulated and public transport will need to be greener and more efficient. Currently the government spends about £17bn a year on measures related to the climate and environment, which, the study shows, would not even be sufficient for it to meet its previous target of an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The IPPR calculates it would need to spend an additional £11bn just to meet that previous target. The Green MP Caroline Lucas, another co-chair of the environmental justice commission said that the economic shock to the economy from the coronavirus made investment in the green economy even more necessary. “This budget will be a litmus test of whether the government understand the climate crisis, and on the basis of the evidence they are falling terrifyingly short of what is needed,” Lucas said. “With likely shocks to the economy because of the coronavirus outbreak, and the accelerating climate emergency, investing in a green new deal is now more important than ever. “It wouldn’t only help us address the climate and nature emergencies, it would transform almost every aspect of our economy and society and deliver on government promises to level up the nation by making our economy fairer and fit for the future.”"
2020-03-07T13:39:20Z,politics,Politics,"Cancelled Rudd event at Oxford not free-speech issue, say feminists","The decision to cancel an event with the former home secretary Amber Rudd at Oxford University has been misunderstood as “no-platforming” and is not a free-speech issue, the ethnic diversity representative at the Oxford Feminist Society has said. The event, In Conversation: Amber Rudd, was organised by UNWomen Oxford as part of its 2020 Trailblazer Series in the lead-up to International Women’s Day on Sunday, but was cancelled 30 minutes before it was due to start after a majority vote by the group’s committee after criticism from students. The incident shows no signs of blowing over. Oxford University has stated its opposition to “no-platforming” and declared it would ensure there would be no repeat of this situation. Meanwhile, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said on Friday evening that the government would step in if universities failed to “defend free speech”. But Safa Sadozai‎, from the Oxford Feminist Society, drew a distinction between the event – advertised as a celebration of Rudd’s achievements for women, without mentioning the Windrush scandal – and a debate where views were challenged robustly. “All the promotional material spoke about Rudd’s role in encouraging women to get involved in parliament and the UN,” Sadozai‎ said. “Under that context, it didn’t sound like it could ever be an open debate where views are challenged.” She said it was widely accepted the decision was last-minute, but described the invitation as “misjudged” and criticised the response of the university. “It’s been misunderstood by the university as a free-speech issue or no-platforming,” Sadozai said. “Many people here were saying she is not entitled to be celebrated or upheld as a feminist.” According to the official Facebook listing for the event, the conversation was expected to be premised around the former minister for women and equalities’ work in a traditionally male-dominated field. The listing said that Rudd had championed equality, urged tough legal penalties to eradicate female genital mutilation and called for a higher proportion of women in cabinet. Rudd has also chaired a cross-party inquiry into unplanned pregnancies, which called for statutory sex and relationships education in all secondary schools, the UNWomen Oxford society said. But Sadozai said: “I personally don’t think she has been very inspiring, but it depends how other women want to perceive her.. “For an event like International Women’s Day, which is about solidarity, it can’t be that difficult to find someone who has had less of a controversial career. It felt like they were disregarding her role in the Windrush scandal.” Rudd stepped down as home secretary as the Windrush scandal escalated and it emerged she had misled parliament over the existence of targets within the Home Office to deport undocumented migrants.
The former Tory MP, who stood down at the last election, said the decision to “no-platform” her shortly before the event “to encourage young women into politics” was badly judged. “They should stop hiding and start engaging. #FreeSpeech,” she tweeted on Friday. Lord MacDonald, the warden of Oxford’s Wadham College, said attendees would have had the opportunity to challenge Rudd on her record and that a free exchange of ideas was fundamental to university life. “It was made clear by this society in advance that people would be free to question her about her policies in government and the impact they had on women of all races,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “The University of Oxford has a very robust free-speech policy, which acknowledges that a part of free expression is a willingness to be confronted with views that you might find unsettling, extreme or even offensive.” Last month, historian Prof Selina Todd was forced to pull out of an event after a boycott threat from other speakers. Williamson said it was “unacceptable” for two speakers to have been “no-platformed at Oxford within a week”. “It is not enough to adopt free-speech codes if they are not enforced,” he told the Telegraph. “I expect the University of Oxford to take robust action over these incidents – and, if universities are not prepared to defend free speech, the government will.”"
2020-03-07T10:00:02Z,politics,Politics,Alex Salmond's trial: what will happen and how it will be reported,"The Scottish legal system has a number of unique features – including the not proven verdict and the requirement for corroboration – which will come into the spotlight as the trial of Alex Salmond begins on 9 March. Scotland’s former first minister will appear at the high court in Edinburgh charged with a series of alleged sexual assaults, including an attempted rape, against 10 women. He denies all the charges. Media covering the trial, which is expected to last for up to four weeks, will be mindful of contempt laws, set out in the 1981 contempt of court act. This applies across the UK and, in some respects, it is applied more strictly in Scotland than in England. For example, the publication of photographs of accused suspects is seldom allowed north of the border. These rules exist to ensure that juries and witnesses are not influenced by anything other than the evidence they hear in court, and apply to everyone from journalists reporting on the trial to individuals posting comments on social media. Not proven is one of three options available to a jury or court in Scotland along with guilty and not guilty. It leaves the accused innocent in the eyes of the law but critics argue it is confusing for juries and the public. The three-verdict system and the need for corroboration – two separate sources of evidence are required before a case can proceed to trial – are thought to have a disproportionate effect on rape and sexual assault cases, leading to markedly lower prosecution and conviction rates. While there is no general prohibition on identifying sexual offence complainers in Scotland, editorial convention dictates that they are not, although such restrictions can apply if a special order is made under s.11 of the 1981 act. During the 10 women’s evidence, the court will be cleared of the public and only two media representatives – from the Press Association and the Edinburgh Court Service – will be in court, with the rest watching by video link in a separate room. Ahead of the case, Rape Crisis Scotland has published a set of guidelines on how to report sexual assault trials responsibly. The eight guidelines, written in conjunction with Prof Karen Boyle of Strathclyde University for the Gender Equal Media Scotland project, encourage reporters to be scrupulous about the language they employ, referring to specific charges rather than “sex claims”, for example, and using neutral descriptives such as “witness”, “accused” and “complainer”. The guidelines also call on journalists to be alert to the effect of their reporting on the public. “These reports reverberate beyond the courtroom. The audience for sexual assault trial reporting includes potential and actual perpetrators and victims or survivors. How these cases are reported can make it more – and less – likely that potential perpetrators reflect on their actions, that incidents are reported to the police, and that victim or survivors seek support.” They also encourage news organisations to provide links to relevant national helplines, noting that organisations supporting victims experience an increase in demand for their services when there are high-profile stories about sexual assault in the media, whatever the outcome of a criminal case. Sandy Brindley, of Rape Crisis Scotland, said: “We know that reporting of sexual assault cases can be really difficult for many survivors, and we do sense that there is a real willingness amongst media organisations to report these issues responsibly. “These guidelines apply to any sexual assault trial, and we hope that they will not only be read by those reporting daily from court but also by editors, headline-writers, and all those who are likely to be discussing any high profile case on radio and television.”"
2020-03-06T18:04:55Z,politics,Politics,Free speech row at Oxford University after Rudd talk cancelled,"A free speech row has broken out at Oxford after the university attacked the decision by a women’s group to cancel a speech by the former home secretary Amber Rudd at the last minute. The university authorities intervened after the UNWomen Oxford society called Rudd, who resigned from the cabinet over the Windrush scandal, to withdraw an invitation to her half an hour before she was due to speak on Thursday. The former MP was pictured with the organiser, Felicity Graham, in an empty auditorium. Rudd said on Friday morning that the decision was “badly judged” and “rude” and urged students who opposed her politics to “stop hiding and start engaging”. The university said it strongly disapproved of the decision to disinvite her, tweeting that it is “committed to freedom of speech and opposes no-platforming”.
The row over the decision – which drew in students, politicians and Rudd’s family on Friday – is the latest incident in the long-running discussion about freedom of speech at universities. The academic Selina Todd was dropped from a feminist conference over her views on transgender rights issues, a decision that prompted the Office for Students to warn that “there is a legal requirement on universities to take steps that are reasonably practicable to secure freedom of speech within the law and protect academic freedom”. UNWomen Oxford said the decision on Rudd came after intense pressure from campaigners to scrap her appearance, with Graham claiming she was adamant the event should go ahead but that “it was the Oxford African and Caribbean Society – who hold a lot of power – who really applied the pressure and forced us to cancel”. But in response, Oxford’s African Caribbean Society (ACS) said it did not call for the cancellation of the event. In a statement published on Twitter it said: “We privately expressed [when approached by Felicity Graham, the UNWomen Oxford president] that although we share the disappointment expressed by some of our members, we did not in any way intend to boycott the event since we, as a cultural society, ultimately have no place to demand the event not go ahead. “The society did not call for Ms Rudd’s speech to be cancelled, nor did we ‘force’ UNWomen Oxford to cancel their event. “Individuals who are members of our society expressed public disapproval, but did so as individuals. Oxford ACS never planned or even discussed ‘boycotting’ the event … In no way did Oxford ACS ‘force this to happen.’” The event, In Conversation: Amber Rudd, had been organised by UNWomen Oxford as part of its UN Women’s 2020 Trailblazer Series ahead of International Women’s Day on Sunday. The former home secretary was to be interviewed about her earlier role as minister for women and equalities and encouraging women to get into politics. Following the row, the UN’s women group for the UK suspended the society’s permission to use its name. UN Women UK asked for the Oxford group to make no further association with the national body and it has now changed its name to United Women Oxford Student Society. Rudd resigned as home secretary in 2018 after heavy pressure over her role in the Windrush scandal. After news of the cancellation broke, she tweeted her frustration at the decision, saying it was “badly judged and rude of some students last night at Oxford to decide to ‘no platform’ me 30 mins before an event … to encourage young women into politics”.
And her daughter, the journalist Flora Gill, tweeted: “Can not believe mum was ‘no-platformed’ at my old Uni yesterday. “I don’t care if you disagree with her … this is NOT how women should treat each other.”
Her political allies gave their support on Friday, with the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, describing the decision as unacceptable and calling on the university to take “robust action” to defend free speech. The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, replied to Rudd’s tweet: “Free speech is the bedrock of a democracy and Oxford University ought to lead the way rather than being snowflake central.” But others were sceptical about the significance of the offence to Rudd. The radio presenter James O’Brien tweeted: “I think Amber Rudd was treated pretty shabbily, but I wish I could think of a word to describe people more exercised by her experience than they were by people of colour being wrongly deported from the only home they’d ever known.”
And the political commentator Ash Sarkar said: “I actually don’t think there’s a moral duty to no platform Amber Rudd the same as a fascist. But after presiding over the wrongful deportations of mums, dads, grandparents & loved ones, you don’t get to complain about not being allowed somewhere you feel you have a right to be.”"
2020-03-06T14:48:20Z,politics,Politics,Rebecca Long-Bailey: Corbyn's heir fights on all fronts in Labour race,"From the top floor of the Lowry Centre in Salford, a supporter of Rebecca Long-Bailey points at the layout of the old docks. He’s there for her Labour leadership campaign rally and wants to explain why accusations she lied about her upbringing are unfair. Her claim that she grew up with her ex-docker father going through round after round of redundancies under Thatcher at Salford docks was heavily scrutinised. They shut in 1982, when she was two years old. The furore forced Long-Bailey to explain he had moved to work at Barton docks, a site not too far in the distance, visible from the Lowry’s floor-to-ceiling windows, around a bend in the Manchester ship canal. It wasn’t the only remark she made that raised eyebrows. Her claim she was “born to the sound of the roar of the Stretford End” was seized upon as another tall tale. Manchester United were apparently playing away that particular day in 1979. The notion the shadow business secretary has been liberal with the truth dogged the beginning of her campaign. Certainly, none of the other Labour leadership candidates have been attacked in the same way, as critics homed in on her authenticity and working-class credentials. There could be many reasons for this scrutiny. To her followers, it’s down to sexism, and the fact her alignment with Jeremy Corbyn makes her the obvious target for a media that hounded him relentlessly too. “She’s had questions and judgments that wouldn’t have been aimed at a man,” said one Labour MP. But for other Labour members – and perhaps a wider electorate – there is another prevalent feeling. People cannot quite work her out, said another MP. After all, she is the socialist who lives in one of Salford’s nicest suburbs Monton, dubbed Monton Carlo. “We have got this thing in the north about ‘how destitute were you as a child?’” one MP said. “We absolutely pore over the views of people’s families and their jobs, like it validates their politics. But when there’s a disconnect, people probe you more.” Long-Bailey’s work ethic, friends say, has somehow been used as a stick to beat her with. And even her most loyal supporters would say she has come across as very serious and forensic on policy in TV interviews and hustings events, without the warmth they see face to face. Long-Bailey has just a month to bridge this gap. She is the natural heir to Corbyn and the most leftwing of the three candidates still in the race, but has polled consistently behind Starmer. Party insiders, however, say the race is far from over: constituency Labour party nominations did go in Starmer’s favour but numbers were often extremely close. But her campaign to become Labour’s first female leader has been a bumpy one, laced with frustration for her followers.
There is some disappointment among her supporters that more has not been made of the expected joint-ticket bid with deputy leadership candidate Angela Rayner, who is also her flatmate when they are in London. The idea just hasn’t taken off. The entry of Richard Burgon into the deputy leadership race, who is unashamedly marketing himself as Corbyn’s successor with a raft of fresh policies, has infuriated some of her backers. They think his ideas, including balloting members on military action and creating a Tony Benn University, trivialise the left and Corbyn’s legacy, sweeping her up along with it. Another irritation for her campaign has been the perpetual criticism that she is being directed by men. She has been described as a docker’s daughter, the puppet of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, or Corbyn, or the Momentum founder Jon Lansman, who is now her leadership campaign chief. She has tried to make light of it; she joked about even being the pope’s puppet, after her Catholic religion and views on abortion became an issue earlier in the campaign. She is personally uncomfortable with terminations beyond the 24-week limit in the event of a severe foetal abnormality, over concerns raised by disability rights groups, but has never sought to restrict abortion law on this matter. She supports a woman’s right to choose. A union source admitted to the Guardian that Long-Bailey had let far too many men dominate her campaign, adding that it was like watching Labour’s version of Judy Garland, being led continuously by male decision-makers. Yet there is no shortage of people who will attest to Long-Bailey’s hard work, devotion to the party and distinctly low-key and policy-focused form of socialism. She read the Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists when she was younger, cites her favourite politician as the late Frank Allaun, the MP for Salford East, who she has said was “quiet and unassuming and true to his beliefs”. This diligence to whatever task comes her way has often led to comments that Long-Bailey is dull. Much was made of her ordinary-sounding “dream Friday night” in her pyjamas with a Chinese takeaway and Netflix. It’s not all cosy nights in, though. She took her husband to see Fatboy Slim at Manchester Arena and her election soundtrack has included the Prodigy, DJ Format, Kasabian and Mr Scruff. In the last few years she has been to the Kendal Calling festival in Cumbria, including the year American hip-hop trio House of Pain headlined, which she described as her “best ever” gig. Weekends with her young son and marketing boss husband, Stephen Bailey, might be spent doing what many people across the country do: swimming or the cinema followed by Pizza Hut. This normality clearly resonates with some and in Salford she is much loved. Chef-turned-councillor Sammie Bellamy decided to change her entire life after seeing Long-Bailey’s political journey. Cheering from the sidelines of her Labour leadership campaign, Bellamy said: “She inspired me. I’m now at uni doing a degree in politics and eventually I would like to try that next step and become an MP and that’s the inspiration she’s had on me.” Family friend Ian Stewart, who was the MP for Eccles between 1997 and 2010, said he knew her from union meetings and her interest in climate change was obvious even then. Now, her green new deal is a flagship policy of the party.
She also likes to keep her political friends on their toes, adding that her particular forte is wryly pointing out inconsistencies in someone’s statement or actions. Laura Smith, the former Labour MP for Crewe and Nantwich, explained how Long-Bailey had always been a strong support to her and texted throughout the night of the December general election, checking in on the collapse of the red wall in punishing real time. Smith’s marginal leave-voting seat turned blue again just two years after she had won it on the wave of Corbyn’s popularity. “She was devastated for me when I lost,” Smith said. “Becky had been in touch with me constantly during the election. She was always listening to me and the concerns that I had over the last few years on Brexit and I know in shadow cabinet she would try to push the other side.” The pair had connected, having the same working-class background, both juggling politics with young families, and sharing a similar commute from seats in the north-west down to parliament every week. They didn’t go to Westminster’s bars, Smith explaining they both felt they were there to do a job, not get swept up in the “lifestyle of Strangers”, the Commons bar. They did, however, go for coffee as often as they could. When Smith was elected on to Cheshire East council in a byelection last week, Long-Bailey was one of the first people to get in touch and celebrate. Smith said: “Nothing against Keir, but as soon as women go for a position of power or leader people try to make out like she’s vulnerable and being controlled by a number of men. That’s rubbish. She’s a strong person.” Long-Bailey is not described as tribal but it cannot be ignored that some MPs feel she is in the frontbench bubble. A colleague, also from the north-west, said her diligence and potential were not in question, but, because she was with Unite from the very beginning of her political career, and then into Corbyn’s team, she had missed a few vital rungs on the ladder. They pointed out that she did not have a wide network of friends across parliament beyond Angela Rayner and another MP, Cat Smith, and her immediate staffers, because she had never been a jobbing backbencher nor socialised beyond her tight circle. They also took offence at so much being made of her Stakhanovite work ethic, particularly the story of her staying up all night to work on the party’s response to the finance bill, when former MP Robert Marris unexpectedly quit the party’s treasury team. “Stuff like that happens all the time – that’s the slog of opposition. People do leave and you’re left being the sole portfolio holder,” they said. One MP from the 2019 intake said she must have failed “socialist Tinder” as she had never met Long-Bailey or been courted for her support at the start of the campaign. “Someone must have taken one look at me online and swiped left, thinking I wasn’t worth bothering with,” she said.
Another new MP said: “No one from Rebecca Long-Bailey’s campaign approached me and I’d made a conscious effort to show when I started that I wasn’t obviously attached to any group. “Not like Emily Thornberry, who must have jumped out at me from every single column in this building to try to speak to me. She probably stopped me about five times.” Long-Bailey presents the enduring conundrum in politics, the balance between policy and personality. Those close to her are effusive about her loyalty, wit, kindness and relatable normality. Yet even fans would say the intensely policy-focused, business-suited candidate is all that people see.

2020-03-06T10:15:59Z,politics,Politics,Amber Rudd hits out at 'rude' Oxford students  after talk cancelled,"The former Conservative home secretary Amber Rudd has hit out at “rude” students at the University of Oxford who cancelled her appearance at an International Women’s Day event 30 minutes before it was due to take place. The event, called “In Conversation: Amber Rudd” and organised by UNWomen Oxford, was scheduled for Thursday evening as part of its UN Women’s 2020 Trailblazer Series before International Women’s Day on Sunday. Rudd, who stepped down as an MP at the last election, was supposed to be interviewed about her earlier role as minister for women and equalities and was due to speak about encouraging women to get into politics. But after receiving criticism for inviting Rudd because of her links with the Windrush scandal, the society announced on Facebook that the talk was cancelled after a majority vote by the group’s committee. Writing on Twitter, Rudd said: “Badly judged and rude of some students last night at Oxford to decide to ‘no platform’ me 30 mins before an event I had been invited to for #IWD2020 to encourage young women into politics. They should stop hiding and start engaging.” Rudd stepped down as home secretary as the Windrush scandal escalated and it emerged she had misled parliament over the existence of targets within the Home Office to deport undocumented migrants. Before cancelling the event, the society attempted to assuage concerns about her appearance in a statement on Facebook. “The concerns we see happening now around this event are absolutely ones which we as a committee feel ourselves,” the statement said. “We invited Ms Rudd on the understanding that this would be an honest and frank conversation about how her policies have impacted women of all races, religions, classes etcetera. “We will not run away from mentioning any of Ms Rudd’s past comments or policies, and we ask you to attend this event to help us campaign for a truly frank feminism which is not afraid of taking such opportunities to discuss these issues with high-profile figures.” The society was incorporated as part of the UNWomen UK’s Student Champion Programme, which aims to involve university students in advocating for gender equality. In response, Rudd’s daughter Florence Gill tweeted: “Can not believe mum was ‘no-platformed’ at my old Uni yesterday. Mum doesn’t need the platform and travelled to talk for FREE for International Womens Day-proceeds to FGM charity. I don’t care if you disagree with her. Its fucking rude This is NOT how women should treat each other.” A number of former politicians also came to Rudd’s defence. Responding to Gill, the former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne tweeted: “Don’t worry about your mum – ‘no platforming’ one of the most senior female politicians of our generation at an International Women’s Day event just makes the Oxford students involved look stupid & small-minded, the very opposite of what that great university stands for. Their loss.” The former Labour deputy leader Tom Watson posted: “If you’re trying to silence Amber Rudd you really are being anti-democratic.” The former Conservative and Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Wollaston tweeted: “No platforming of @AmberRuddUK by Oxford is absurd & worrying. Why are universities allowing ideological fringes to crush freedom of speech in our centres of excellence?”"
2020-03-06T00:01:21Z,politics,Politics,Tory governments spend more on London than rest of England – thinktank,"The Treasury should stop directing so much money towards rich and productive London if it is serious about the “levelling up agenda” that Boris Johnson hopes will help him retain red wall seats, according to a report by centre-right thinktank Onward. Its analysis by Neil O’Brien, a Tory MP and former adviser to George Osborne, found that the successive governments have spent much more on transport, science, affordable housing and culture in London than elsewhere in England over many years. He found that transport spending was almost three times higher in London than the average in the rest of England since 2008 and the capital has received nearly twice the UK average science spending since 2001. London will also have experienced five times as much support for affordable housing between 2016 and 2021, and nearly five times as much spending on culture as the rest of England between 2011 and 2018. The thinktank said next week’s budget should be a moment for Rishi Sunak, the new chancellor, to rethink the Treasury’s priorities and stop the skewing of spending towards London and the south-east. O’Brien, who advised Osborne and Theresa May before entering parliament, said: “For decades we have piled fertiliser on the parts of our economy that are already flourishing while refusing to water the seeds of growth elsewhere. The PM’s mission to level up poorer parts of the country is vital.” The Treasury has been looking at rewriting its rules to permit greater investment in areas such as the north of England and the Midlands, after years of complaints that the current system overly favours London and the south-east. The change to the method of evaluating the economic benefits of spending could potentially introduce new metrics, such as improving the wellbeing of people in certain areas, or reducing regional productivity gaps. “I think as well as being good for the economy and the right thing to do, it is also good politically to be changing these rules that have existed for decades,” O’Brien said. Johnson has embraced an agenda of “levelling up” across the country after gains in the north and Midlands propelled him to a general election victory with a majority of more than 80 seats. Onward suggested the chancellor should “use every tool at his disposal” to improve regional growth and prevent government spending further unbalancing the economy. These also included proposals to devolve transport powers to more places in England and redirecting cultural funding away from the national institutions in London."
2020-03-05T20:41:58Z,politics,Politics,"Build an Irish Sea tunnel, not a bridge, says Scottish secretary","The UK government could build a tunnel under the Irish Sea instead of a new bridge linking Scotland with Northern Ireland, Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, has revealed. Jack told MSPs on Thursday he had raised the tunnel proposal with Boris Johnson as a cheaper and more weatherproof option than a bridge over the sea. He said he believed Johnson’s previous references to a bridge were a euphemism, and that the best crossing would be a tunnel – a theory he said the prime minister had asked UK government officials to investigate. “It would be less expensive to tunnel it,” he told MSPs on the Scottish parliament’s culture, tourism, Europe and external affairs committee. “It’s no different to the tunnels connecting the Faroe Islands, it’s no different to the tunnels going under the fjords.” Jack insisted there were longer tunnels in other parts of the world, and told reporters he envisaged the crossing starting as a bridge, then going under the sea for a 22-mile tunnel before rising up to be carried by a bridge again. He said that a bridge across the entire distance could be closed for up to 100 days a year by the severe weather which can hit the Irish Sea. His proposal was quickly ridiculed by his opponents. Ross Greer, a Scottish Green Party MSP who questioned him during the committee hearing, said: “These proposals might be headline grabbing but let’s face it, they are pure fantasy, just like the Tory approach to Brexit which Mr Jack so spectacularly failed to explain to the committee.”
Proposals for a bridge over the Irish Sea have had support in principle from across the political spectrum, including from Mike Russell, the Scottish Brexit secretary and SNP MSP, and Arlene Foster, the Democratic Unionist party leader. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, has not opposed the idea but her government was sceptical about the economic justification for sinking tens of billions of pounds into a crossing, arguing the money could be better spent on other projects.
The leading option is to build the crossing from Portpatrick, near Stranraer in south-west Scotland, to Larne, north of Belfast, although a crossing from the Mull of Kintyre in Russell’s Argyll and Bute constituency has also been mooted. Critics say the bridge runs the clear risk of encountering a vast dump of more than 1m tonnes of old munitions dumped in Beaufort’s Dyke, a 300-metre deep ocean trench. Jack said a tunnel could avoid disturbing the spent shells dumped there. “Once we get better sight of the costs involved, should the prime minister decide to press the button, we would then want to engage with both [the Northern Ireland assembly and the Scottish parliament] to get a better understanding of the benefits and the challenges,” he said. “We’re not going to just come riding roughshod and slam a tunnel in – and by the way, under the settlement of devolution, nor can we.” Sturgeon’s spokesman told reporters after Jack’s evidence that the idea of a tunnel was news to the Scottish government. He said Michael Matheson, the Scottish transport and infrastructure secretary, had written to the UK government questioning the rationale for the project last month. “If you’ve a spare £100bn, pick a number, it would be better off being spent in other ways, including a fair share for Scotland and Northern Ireland,” the spokesman said."
2020-03-05T18:50:58Z,politics,Politics,Johnson aims to integrate Foreign Office and DfID operations,"Boris Johnson has been accused of heading back towards the “bad old days” of linking foreign aid to the UK’s trade goals, after the government said he wanted all Foreign Office and international development operations abroad to be fully integrated “to promote Global Britain”. Labour and charities expressed concern about a merger between the departments “by the back door”, as it emerged the government had asked for Department for International Development (DfID) missions in other countries to report directly to Foreign Office ambassadors. They also raised the alarm about the potential for the government’s new integrated review of foreign policy to examine the current ban on tied aid – the idea that development money is linked to the UK’s trade goals and commercial interests, rather than simply alleviating poverty. This was outlawed under Tony Blair’s government in 2002 with the International Development Act. DfID insisted that its own ministers would be fully responsible for aid budget decisions “within existing departmental lines”. However, all of its ministers, apart from Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the international development secretary, are now shared jointly with the Foreign Office. Trevelyan has previously expressed sceptical views on foreign aid, once tweeting that “charity begins at home”. The DfID statement also pointed out that Johnson was “clear he wants all aspects of the government’s international operations to be integrated fully to promote Global Britain”. Dan Carden, the shadow international development secretary, said Labour was worried that there appeared to be a “clear attempt to merge DfID into the FCO by the back door”. “Under Johnson’s leadership we are heading back to the days of ‘tied aid’ with UK aid spent in Britain’s commercial or security interests,” he said. “Both departments have important, but distinct, purposes and it must stay that way if the government takes seriously its role in tackling global poverty.” In response to Labour’s comments, a DfID spokesman said: “It is the UK’s policy to keep aid untied.” Stephen Doughty, a former shadow foreign minister, said: “It is deeply concerning there now appears to be a back door attempt to divert our development spending to provide sweeteners for trade deals and tying it in a way that would take us back to the bad old days of the 1980s. Not only would this be bad development practice but it could lead to money being spent less effectively and less accountably.” He added: “It is absolutely clear that there needs to be a cooperative strategy between diplomatic, defence, development and trade agendas but that is a wholly different thing from merging them under the hierarchy of one. This will only lead to skewed priorities and funds not being spent effectively, and may well in fact conflict with laws around the use of our development assistance.” There were multiple reports before Johnson’s cabinet reshuffle in February that he wanted to formally merge the FCO and DfID but he stopped short of that goal. However, there is still the possibility that this may happen after this year’s spending review, if No 10 feels that the Foreign Office and DfID are not yet working closely enough together with joint ministers. Johnson launched a major integrated review of foreign policy, defence and development last month, which some view as a precursor to merging the two departments. The prime minister told the FT last year: “If ‘Global Britain’ is going to achieve its full and massive potential then we must bring back DfID to the FCO. We can’t keep spending huge sums of British taxpayers’ money as though we were some independent Scandinavian NGO.” Charities also expressed concern about the latest developments. Simon Starling, director of policy, advocacy and research at Bond, a UK network for international development charities and NGOs, described the reports that DfID staff were being told to report directly to the Foreign Office as “alarming and suggest the outcome of the integrated security, defence and foreign policy review has been decided before it has even taken place – with zero consultation with humanitarian and development experts”. Starling added: “UK aid is increasingly at risk of becoming politicised, a move which will make it less effective at reducing global poverty and inequality. The British taxpayer cannot afford for aid to be misspent on vanity projects where there is little evidence that it will reach those who need our support the most.”"
2020-03-05T18:18:22Z,politics,Politics,300 allegations of Tory Islamophobia sent to equality watchdog,"A dossier of more than 300 allegations of Islamophobia in the Conservative party has been submitted to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, increasing pressure on the watchdog to launch a formal investigation. The submission from the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) catalogues evidence of allegedly Islamophobic comments and actions by hundreds of activists, councillors, and advisers to the prime minister. It also includes comments made by Tory candidates in the election who later became MPs, two of which were first revealed by the Guardian. Sally-Ann Hart, the MP for Hastings and Rye, was put under investigation by the party for sharing a post claiming a women’s march had been hijacked by the Muslim Brotherhood to promote the “Muslim agenda”. Anthony Browne, the MP for South Cambridgeshire, questioned the loyalty of Muslims to Britain when responding to Muslim leaders’ concerns about the Iraq war. Karl McCartney, the MP for Lincoln, retweeted Islamophobic and antisemitic posts by Tommy Robinson and Katie Hopkins. Browne and McCartney apologised for their actions. The MCB also highlighted the role of Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s de facto chief of staff, in having responsibility for the Spectator website when a controversial cartoon of the prophet Muhammad with a bomb in his turban was posted, with a caption feeding into a far-right, Islamophobic trope about a Muslim “takeover”. Another example was that of Andrew Sabisky, briefly a No 10 adviser, who questioned in a book review whether a growing Muslim population would be countered with violent resistance. The dossier also includes allegations against Boris Johnson himself, who has previously apologised for describing Muslim women wearing face-covering veils as looking like “letterboxes”. The MCB first sent a file of 150 cases to the EHRC 10 months ago. However, the watchdog has resisted launching an inquiry until it can see the terms of reference of the Tories’ independent investigation into prejudice within the party. With no action so far, the MCB said it was sending another 150 cases and accused the EHRC, which launched an investigation in allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party last year, of failing to act on evidence of “institutional, systemic and widespread” Islamophobia in the Conservative party. The secretary general of the MCB, Harun Khan, which represents 500 Muslim groups, mosques and charities, said: “Having furnished the Equality and Human Rights Commission with evidence of over 100 incidents of Islamophobia in the Conservative party 10 months ago, we find it extraordinary that the commission has failed to give any response, let alone inform us and British Muslims as to whether action will be taken. “Two years ago, we estimated that there were cases of Islamophobia being identified in the party on a weekly basis. Now, with over 300 documented incidents, it appears our estimation was too low. There is no doubt that the Conservative party has an Islamophobia crisis. The party’s response has been one of denial, dismissal and deceit. “This results in clear discrimination against Muslims because of their religion. Islamophobia is never acceptable, yet this dossier cites hundreds of individuals – including many in significant positions of power and influence – who have made horribly offensive comments about Muslims that would not be tolerated for any other section in our society.” He said the EHRC had a duty to uphold the Equality Act and called on the watchdog to take the wealth of evidence into account by launching a formal investigation. On becoming prime minister, Johnson had pledged to launch an inquiry into all forms of discrimination, including Islamophobia, before the end of last year. However, the terms of reference have still not been published. A spokesperson from the EHRC said: “We are actively considering what, if any, action we may take in relation to the handling of Islamophobia and other discrimination within the Conservative party. We are also awaiting the final terms of reference of the party’s independent review which we will consider as part of our decision-making process.”"
2020-03-05T18:11:58Z,politics,Politics,Labour faces claims members yet to receive leadership ballots,"Labour is under pressure to step up its efforts to ensure party members receive their leadership ballots amid widespread reports of glitches. Several leadership and deputy leadership campaigns have told the Guardian their canvassers are picking up a large volume of party members still awaiting their ballot.
The issue appears to be particularly acute for new members who joined the party after December’s election, believed to number more than 100,000, who are being subjected to a verification process that involves checking their address against the electoral roll. Polling suggests this group, as well as those who joined before Jeremy Corbyn became leader, are less likely to support his preferred candidate, Rebecca Long-Bailey. Some may have joined in the hope of voting for Jess Phillips, who was campaigning for new members to sign up, but withdrew from the contest as it became clear she was unlikely to receive the endorsement of any of the major unions. The latest YouGov poll showed 67% of members joining since the election backed Keir Starmer – against 43% who joined in the previous four years. A source at one of the campaigns said: “It’s a small sample, but our phone-banking data is showing 80% of those who haven’t had their ballot paper joined either pre-2015 or post-2019 general election.” A second campaign described a “large scale failure”, with “many, many people” having to reapply for their ballots. Another Labour source, with knowledge of the process, claimed queries had been raised about the eligibility of thousands of new members, with staff unable to match their details with the electoral roll. Members are then contacted, and given the opportunity to resolve the discrepancy. Labour’s website warns members they may have to wait up to 10 days for a ballot to be reissued if they have missed out. Members can also use a self-service portal to make the request, but there are claims of a backlog. Chris Matheson, the MP for Chester and a Starmer supporter, said: “It is very worrying that two thirds of the way into this contest many Labour members appear not to have received their ballot papers. The general secretary needs to provide urgent assurance that all outstanding ballots will be dispatched as soon as possible.” Lisa Nandy supporter Louise Haigh, the MP for Sheffield Heeley, said: “Lots of new members who have joined our party since the devastation of the general election to have a say in our future have a right to their vote and it must be exercised. The party need to sort this out immediately and make sure all members are reassured they will get a chance to vote.” Voting opened last week, and will continue until noon on 2 April, with the result due to be announced at a special conference on 4 April. Labour officials declined to comment, but pointed out there is still plenty of time for queries to be resolved and ballots issued. If none of the three remaining candidates win more than 50% of the vote in the first round, the third-place candidate will be eliminated, and their votes reallocated to those members’ second choice. Long-Bailey has sought to shake up the race in recent days by challenging Starmer over how his well-oiled campaign machine is being funded. Pressed on the issue by Andrew Neil on Wednesday, the shadow Brexit secretary revealed that the £100,000 donation from a fellow barrister he reported earlier this week was the largest he has received. Long-Bailey told Neil: “I think there’s always an assumption that you don’t get something for nothing in this world. And those who donate to your campaign will expect to be repaid in some way in the future.” Her campaign has received significant contributions from the Unite trade union, and from leftwing Labour group Momentum, whose founder, Jon Lansman, is chairing her campaign. Wigan MP Nandy, who has been more critical of Labour’s policies and approach than either of her two rivals, told HuffPost on Wednesday she remained confident she could still win, saying there were “a lot of members who are undecideds, who haven’t made up their mind who their first choice is”. She hopes to nose ahead of Long-Bailey, whose second preferences she would then hope to pick up. There have been few stark policy disagreements during the campaign, with Starmer adopting 10 markedly leftwing “pledges”, including widespread nationalisation, abolishing tuition fees and passing a new law to prevent illegal wars. Starmer received the backing of former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown on Thursday, who said he, “has all the qualifications that are necessary for a prime minister of the future”. “A vote for Keir Starmer is a vote for hope. It’s a vote for the future. It’s a vote for the values that all of us believe in deeply,” Brown said. Long-Bailey has prioritised the environment, saying she would seek to make it a part of Labour’s constitution, in a new clause IV. And she has also focused on party democracy, calling for open selection of all parliamentary candidates."
2020-03-05T17:06:41Z,politics,Politics,Brexit: Barnier says UK is refusing to commit to remaining signed up to ECHR as part of EU deal – as it happened,"Michel Barnier has spoken of “grave” differences between the EU and the UK over their future relationship, warning that Boris Johnson’s refusal to formally commit to the European convention on human rights could limit cooperation in fighting crime. The number of coronavirus infections in the UK has exceeded 100, with 115 people having now tested positive, the Department of Health and Social Care has said. The announcement came as Sir Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, told MPs that the government’s response to coronavirus had now moved from the point where it was mainly focusing on containing the disease to the point where it was mainly focusing on delaying its spread. But Boris Johnson said that for the moment it should be “business as usual” for people and that Britain would get through the coronavirus outbreak “in good shape”. (See 1.17pm.) For full coverage of the latest coronavirus developments, in the UK and around the world, do read our separate live blog.
Gordon Brown has backed Keir Starmer to be Labour leader, saying he has all the qualifications needed to become prime minister. Drugs and terrorism have driven the recent rise in homicides - with each killing costing society an estimated £3.2m, according to a new report (pdf). The rate of murders and manslaughters in England and Wales soared by 39% between the year ending March 2015 and 2018, to a higher point than at any time between 1900 and 1970, Home Office research found. As the Press Association reports, there were four times as many homicide deaths in the year ending March 31 2018 as those resulting from terror attacks since 1980. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, said: These are damning but frankly unsurprising findings. The home affairs committee has repeatedly warned that deep cuts to policing would have dangerous consequences for public safety. For years Home Office ministers have insisted that there is no direct relationship between the number of police officers and levels of crime on our streets – this report indicates that there is one and that more police officers mean fewer homicides. Boris Johnson has signalled he has no regrets about refusing to visit areas devastated by floods this year and claimed the emergency services advised him to stay away. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments."
2020-03-05T16:58:56Z,politics,Politics,Barnier warns of grave differences between EU and UK in trade talks,"Michel Barnier has spoken of grave differences between the EU and the UK over their future relationship, warning that Boris Johnson’s refusal to formally commit to the European convention on human rights would limit cooperation in fighting crime. Following the first round of negotiations between the two 100-strong teams, the EU’s chief negotiator said there were many “serious divergences” between the two sides. The problematic areas were said to range from the maintenance of a level playing field for British and European businesses to the role of the European court of justice and conditions on future access for European fishing fleets to British waters. In response, a UK government spokesman said there were “expected, significant differences” but that the final deal had to respect that the country would be outside the orbit of EU law or its courts. As he ran through the main obstacles to a deal, Barnier warned that the British position on the role of European courts threatened “the level of ambition of our cooperation” on joint work to fight crime, terrorism and money laundering. He said the UK had informed him that “they do not wish formally to commit to continuing to apply the European convention on human rights, nor do they wish to permit the European court of justice to play its full role in interpreting EU law”. Barnier said that on issues such as the exchange of personal data, including DNA, the UK’s formal commitment to the convention on human rights and the recognition in any trade deal of the role of the court of justice as the arbiter of EU law was a “must have”. “This is serious, I say this is grave, because if the United Kingdom’s position does not move it will have an immediate and concrete effect on the level of ambition of our cooperation,” he said. The British government has not said it will quit the European convention on human rights but it does not believe the EU should demand obligations in a treaty beyond that agreed by other independent countries. Boris Johnson’s government also insists that there should not be a role for the European court of justice within any future treaty, while accepting that the court interprets EU law for member states. A UK source close to the negotiations said the government’s “determination to regain independence did not compromise our commitment to high standards in all areas” including in human rights. “But that doesn’t mean that we can accept a relationship that limits our freedom to legislate in those areas or enforce the supremacy of the law,” the source added. On the EU’s demand that any free-trade deal must involve signing up to current European regulations on environment, workers’ rights and state aid for companies, British negotiators have said they intend to maintain high standards but oppose making them a precondition for a trade deal. “Whilst we agree on preserving high standards, my question is why not commit to them formally? It is a question of trust,” Barnier said. He added that he had been “quite surprised” to see the UK mandate for negotiations with the US, in which the government is vowing it will not water down standards. “I was very interested to see that there was this element of the level playing field,” Barnier said. “Of course it’s a different context, different proximity, geographic and economic proximity. But the philosophy … is the same. We will need an agreement on the level playing field to guarantee that that was promised by Boris Johnson and the European leaders in the political declaration [to] avoid any unfair competitive advantages.” The British government has said the commitments it is willing to make to avoid distortions in trade through undercutting standards are similar in both deals. On fishing rights, Barnier said the UK’s proposal to negotiate the level of catches in British waters on an annual basis, similar to an agreement with Norway, was impractical. He noted that the EU and Norway negotiated over five species of fish while there were 100 shared stocks in European and British seas. Barnier said the British government was further insisting that fisheries should be outside the main trade deal. “An economic agreement with the UK will have to include a balanced agreement on fisheries,” he insisted. A UK government source described the EU’s negotiating ask as being “the status quo”. “That is not going to happen”, the source added. The two sides are also at loggerheads on the nature of the agreement they are seeking. The EU wants one over-arching agreement covering everything from trade to transport, fisheries to agricultural standards, underpinned by a common dispute-settlement system. The UK wants a series of mini-deals that have different arrangements for resolving disputes when needed. Barnier said the EU’s preferred “association agreement” model was “not a matter of ideology” but a “practical question”. The EU is concerned that having multiple deals will make ratification more difficult with national parliaments seeking a say. Despite the differences, Barnier said he remained confident that a deal was possible by the end of the year."
2020-03-05T15:53:36Z,politics,Politics,"As Chris Whitty provides a dose of reality, Boris is just an annoying distraction | John Crace","What a difference a week makes. For several years now, we’ve got used to being told that experts are a waste of space. Doomsters and gloomsters who trade in telling you things you don’t want to hear. What was needed was a good honest dose of mindless optimism to talk the country up. Want to believe that Brexit will be a brilliant success and there’s an oven-ready deal to take us to the promised land? Then the Tories had just the government for you. But now we’re heading for several months of a coronavirus pandemic, the UK wants rather more than a prime minister who lies about building 40 new hospitals and a 12-year-old Tigger of a health secretary whose main contribution has been to replace his Blue Peter sticker with a NHS badge. Even Boris Johnson, the narcissist’s narcissist who can’t imagine a world without him at its centre, has had to bow to the inevitable and take advice from people who know what they are talking about. For a while at least, the geeks have inherited the Earth. And the Geek-in-Chief, whom everyone now regards as the country’s de facto prime minister, is Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer. There’s no one who wouldn’t rather listen to a few minutes of Whitty than half an hour of Boris’s bullshit. Temporarily at least, Boris has become a near irrelevance. An annoying distraction. Whitty first captured the nation’s minds during Tuesday’s Downing Street press conference, during which Boris’s main contribution had been to make jokes and offer unscientific, cheery reassurances – reality has never been his strong point – and now he was back before the health select committee to provide rather more detail about the coronavirus crisis over the best part of two hours. Whitty’s only real downside is that he looks unfortunately like Chris Grayling. They could almost be brothers. But there the similarity ends. The moment Whitty opens his mouth, the words flow with liquid intelligence. His command of his subject and his ability to communicate that knowledge is near-total. This is not a man whose solution to the pandemic would be to award a £13m contract for hospital ships to a company with no ships.
There’s something very weird about the choice of Jeremy Hunt as the health committee’s chair. Rather like putting the chief suspect in charge of a murder investigation. The man who, as former health secretary, did more to screw up the NHS with endless cuts to provision and services is now responsible for finding out why the NHS is in such a mess and to hold the culprits responsible. I’d imagine we’re going to see Jeremy Hunt asking Jeremy Hunt some very awkward questions over the coming years. That was something for another day, however – and if Whitty was as bemused as the rest of us to find a rather sweaty, twitchy and jacketless Hunt in charge of proceedings, he was too polite to let on. Rather, he merely restated the facts as he knew them. We had now moved from the “pretending nothing was happening and hoping it would go away” phase, which had been the government’s plan before he had been brought onboard, and into delay mode. The idea being that the worst of the pandemic could be spread out over a matter of months to ease the pressure on public services. Whitty never tried to soft-soap or minimise the situation. In a worst-case scenario, 80% of the country could get the virus, the mortality rate could reach 1%, with the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions most at risk, and there would be no chance of the NHS having enough beds. And though his attempts at reassurance – “most people over 80 will live” – didn’t sound particularly reassuring, there was something undeniably refreshing about his honesty and directness. Here was a man willing to treat the country as adults and didn’t feel the need to lie about the severity of the situation. Sadly, this isn’t an attitude likely to catch on in government, as Boris was only too happy to demonstrate during a simultaneous appearance on ITV’s This Morning with Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield. Even when he strives for authenticity, he can’t help being shifty. It’s as though something within him can’t survive contact with reality. He doesn’t want to publish regular updates on the spread of the virus, not because the public can’t handle the information but because he can’t. He just wants the crisis to be over and for people to get on with their lives: the anxiety and experience of going through it is anathema to him. The dishonesty continued when the conversation turned to floods and to Priti Patel. After saying that he didn’t want to interrupt the emergency services – though he was happy to let junior ministers do so and had been quick to do so himself during the election campaign – he went on to defend his home secretary and implied that the bullying inquiry would be a stitch-up because Priti was doing such a great job. A bit of bullying was healthy collateral damage. “I hate bullies,” he said. Which is why he has Classic Dom as his chief of staff. The only bully one suspects he really hates is himself. His self-loathing is manifest in numerous displacement activities. The one really jaw-dropping moment came when he was asked if he would change his baby’s nappies. For almost every dad, this is a no-brainer. The very minimal level of care you would afford a child you had brought into the world. He was eventually shamed into saying: “Yes, I expect so”, but it was clear Boris had no real intention of doing even this. Carrie must have watched in despair. She was going to be on her own with this one. There was little comfort for the rest of us either. If he treats his own family with such indifference, just imagine how he really feels about us. Just inconvenient satellites orbiting his world. Later in the morning, Michel Barnier was left to give a solo press conference after the first round of the Brexit trade negotiations. The UK’s David Frost couldn’t be bothered to show up as he was desperate to get the hell out of Brussels and have a patriotic English breakfast. Barnier sighed heavily. The UK still didn’t really have a clue just how complicated the negotiations were: it imagined turning up and shouting: “We’re British” would work wonders, he said. Much like our first response to the coronavirus. The thought occurred that if we also replaced Frost with Whitty, a trade deal would be a lot more likely. • This article was amended on 5 March 2020 because Chris Whitty is England’s chief medical officer, not the UK’s as an earlier version said."
2020-03-05T12:48:13Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson defends decision not to visit UK's flood-hit areas,"Boris Johnson has signalled he has no regrets about refusing to visit areas devastated by floods this year and claimed the emergency services advised him to stay away. The prime minister came under fire for heading to the government’s country mansion at Chevening during half-term rather than visiting flood-hit areas. Pressed repeatedly on whether he feels now that was the wrong decision, Johnson made the claim that the fire services, Environment Agency and others had told him his presence would be counterproductive. He has previously taken the decision to visit flood-hit homes during the general election campaign and some of his ministers made repeated visits to devastated homeowners during the latest disaster. Speaking to ITV’s This Morning, he said: “They [the emergency services] said to us: ‘All you’ll do is distract us and disrupt the business of helping people with the immediate crisis.’ So what I was doing was directing operations … Obviously, I’m working around the clock on various things, as indeed is the government.” Last week, Labour branded Johnson a “part-time prime minister” over his absence from the public eye during the floods. It has called for an independent review into the government’s sluggish reaction. Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, said: “There needs to be an independent review into the government’s woefully slow response to help flood-hit communities. We need to know how many homes and businesses have been affected, and what additional funding will be made available to local authorities and emergency services. “Labour will continue to support communities devastated by the floods and hold the government to account for its inaction.”"
2020-03-05T12:22:15Z,politics,Politics,Gordon Brown backs Keir Starmer for Labour leader,"Gordon Brown has backed Keir Starmer to be Labour leader, saying he has all the qualifications needed to become prime minister. Brown said all three candidates were worthy but Starmer was his first choice. He highlighted Rebecca Long-Bailey’s commitment to a green new deal and Lisa Nandy’s focus on the importance of empowering communities. He said: “There is one candidate with the expertise, with the eloquence, with the dedication, with the commitment and indeed with the values that are necessary for Labour to return to power. Keir Starmer has all the qualifications that are necessary for a prime minister of the future. A vote for Keir Starmer is a vote for hope. It’s a vote for the future. It’s a vote for the values that all of us believe in deeply. Join Keir Starmer and let’s elect a Labour government.” In his video statement in support of Starmer, Brown laid into the Conservatives’ record over the last decade of “demolishing much of the social fabric and the postwar social contract” that Labour created. “Our public services are deteriorating and the National Health Service is struggling from crisis to crisis. Britain deserves better than this and it needs a Labour party with a vision of what can be achieved in the new world of the 2020s,” he said. Brown predicted that Labour under Starmer could reverse the changes to society overseen by the Tories. Starmer is the clear frontrunner in the contest, with Long-Bailey in second place and Nandy in third. There is a month left for members, trade unionists and registered supporters to vote before the winner is announced in early April. Brown’s predecessor as Labour prime minister, Tony Blair, has not backed a candidate, saying he does not want to harm their chances."
2020-03-04T21:24:44Z,politics,Politics,Labour leadership: Long-Bailey accuses Starmer of lacking policy during Andrew Neil interviews - as it happened,"And here are the main points from the Rebecca Long-Bailey interview. Rebecca Long-Bailey accused Keir Starmer of not having clear policies. Asked about the policy differences between her and him, she replied: I donâ€™t know what Keirâ€™s policy ideas are, if Iâ€™m honest. I know he says he wants to adopt the same values that the Labour party currently has, but what does that mean in practice? Asked if she trusted him to stick to Jermey Corbynâ€™s legacy, she replied: I think we need to see more detail, we need to see more meat on the bone in terms of what Keir believes in. She said that in principle she thought it would be a good idea for the Labour membership to have the chance to reconfirm her as leader in another ballot before the general election. But it might not be practical, she said. Asked if she supported mandatory reselection for party leaders, she said: I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s a bad idea. I think it would be quite disruptive potentially to do that in the months before a general election. But I certainly like your way of thinking. She accepted that, if she lost the next general election as leader, there would be another leadership contest. She said: When we have the general election, after that if we donâ€™t win the general election, then weâ€™ll have another leadership election. There was no leadership election after Corbyn lost the 2017 general election (although he had been challenged the year before.) She said it was wrong to describe her as continuity Corbynism, because there was no such thing as Corbynism. She said: Thereâ€™s no such thing as Corbynism and this is one of the things that always irks me. There is socialism and there are principles in the Labour party. And if I continue them, then Iâ€™m proud to do that. But Iâ€™m certainly not a continuation of Jeremy Corbyn or indeed any other member of the shadow cabinet or previous leader. She said, when she gave Corbyn 10 out of 10 in an interview, she was passing judgment on him as a person, not as a leader. She refused to give him marks out of 10 as a leader. She insisted she did have what it took to be prime minister. When this was put to her, she said: I think thereâ€™s two elements to a leader. The first is being electable and resonating with communities and speaking the language of aspiration. The second is actually having the policies to improve their lives. And you need to have those two things, one doesnâ€™t come without the other. She rejected claims that at a meeting of Labourâ€™s national executive committee in July 2018 she sided with those opposed to the party adopting in full the International Holocaust Memorial Alliance definition of antisemitism. She was in favour of that, and assumed it would be adopted, she said. When Andrew Neil told her that â€œpeople who were in the room have told us that you stayed silent and you went along with those who opposed itâ€�, she said that there was no vote taken at the meeting and that she could not remember if she spoke on the subject. But she said she fully supported adoption of the definition. Thatâ€™s all from me for tonight. Here is my colleague Heather Stewartâ€™s story about the two interviews.
Thanks for the comments."
2020-03-04T21:14:16Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer: Andrew Neil and Long-Bailey keep up donation pressure,"Keir Starmer has said the largest donation to his Labour leadership campaign has been the £100,000 from a like-minded lawyer that he has already declared, as he came under attack from rival Rebecca Long-Bailey. The pair appeared in separate interviews with the BBC’s Andrew Neil on Wednesday, and Starmer was challenged over the source of his funding. He said he was complying with Labour’s rules for declaring donations and, after being repeatedly pressed by Neil, said the £100,000 contribution – details of which were published on Tuesday – was the largest he had received. That donation came from Robert Latham, a fellow barrister. “Nobody’s given me more than £100,000, that biggest donation went up yesterday or the day before,” he said. Long-Bailey’s campaign has repeatedly sought to cast aspersions on the financial backing for what they argue is Starmer’s very well-funded campaign. She told Neil: “I think there’s always an assumption that you don’t get nothing for nothing in this world. And those who donate to your campaign will expect to be repaid in some way in the future.” Long-Bailey also claimed Starmer had not yet given sufficient details of what his policies would be if he becomes Labour leader – despite the frontrunner having published a 10-point list of “pledges”. “I don’t know what Keir’s policy ideas are, if I’m honest. I know he says he wants to adopt the same values that the LP [Labour party] has, but what does that mean in practice?” she said. “I hope that he keeps to our values and our principles. I think we need to see more detail. We need to see more meat on the bone, in terms of what Keir believes in – and indeed about all of the candidates.” Long-Bailey was questioned repeatedly by Neil over her role in helping to create contracts for the NHS under the private finance initiative (PFI), when she worked as a lawyer in Manchester. She said PFI was “the only game in town” at the time; and that she had become an MP to try to change what she called “the intricacies and the insidious nature of PFI”. Long-Bailey, who is widely thought to be Jeremy Corbyn’s pick to replace him but appears keen to shrug off the label of being a continuity candidate, refused to repeat the 10/10 score she gave the Labour leader in an interview just after the general election. “That was quite a cheeky interview, and I was asked what I thought of Jeremy and I’ve always said that Jeremy is an honest, decent, principled man. But we did face the worst defeat that we’ve ever seen as a Labour party.” She said she had given him full marks, “as a person: and I’ll always give Jeremy top scores for the decent human being that he is”. But she added: “I’m not going to mark anybody out of 10, it’s not top trumps we’re talking about here. We’re talking about the reasons for our defeat, and they were manifold.” Starmer defended Labour’s Brexit position at the general election – and claimed that “gritty” conversations in leave-voting areas had convinced him that he could win back such seats for Labour. “Once we’ve got beyond the gritty conversation, and I’ve said to people what are the two or three things you really want me to look at on the train on the way home, they’ve said we need infrastructure and transport, we need jobs with real dignity and security, and we want decisions made by us,” he said. He also claimed his argument for free movement to be restored after Brexit would resonate in such communities."
2020-03-04T20:56:01Z,politics,Politics,Johnson pushed to disclose when he heard Patel bullying claims,"Boris Johnson is under pressure to disclose when he first heard claims of bullying by Priti Patel as new details emerged of her alleged behaviour towards staff in three government departments. The prime minister brushed over Jeremy Corbyn’s repeated questions on Wednesday, asking how much he knew about the allegations when he appointed Patel as home secretary last summer. Several sources claim the Cabinet Office was told about her alleged intimidation of staff in 2017. Patel faces a Cabinet Office inquiry, overseen by Johnson, and an employment tribunal brought by Sir Philip Rutnam, her former permanent secretary. She denies any allegation of wrongdoing. Westminster sources claim the Conservative party was warned about a bullying allegation in the Department for Work and Pensions when Patel was employment minister but failed to take any action. A source with knowledge of the complaint said a former DWP staff member contacted Conservative campaign headquarters to make the party aware of Patel’s alleged behaviour some time before she was promoted to home secretary. The complainant was given a £25,000 payout after taking an overdose of prescription medicine following alleged bullying, the BBC reported. At prime minister’s questions, Corbyn asked if Johnson knew about the bullying claims and why public money was used to pay off civil servants who complained about Patel. “On each occasion, tens of thousands of pounds of hard-earned taxpayers’ money has been spaffed up the wall to buy their silence. Was the prime minister aware of these allegations about the home secretary? If he was, why did he appoint her?” he said. Johnson gave a public show of support for Patel who sat on the Commons frontbench alongside him. “The home secretary is doing an outstanding job – delivering change, putting police on the streets, cutting crime and delivering a new immigration system – and I’m sticking by her,” he said. Allegations emerged on Tuesday night that the home secretary had bullied her private secretary, who had to sign off from work with stress. It allegedly occurred when she was international development secretary between 2016 and 2017. A former Department for International Development (DfID) staff member told the Guardian that Patel’s “bang the table” attitude towards staff was “common knowledge”. “There was an internal inquiry about the culture. I’d heard of people being called useless,” they said. Penny Mordaunt, who came in immediately after Patel, conducted an internal investigation into the department’s culture, the staff member said. Mordaunt, who is now the paymaster general, made a speech to staff saying she had wanted to get people’s “mojo” back. Patel was sacked by Theresa May as international development secretary over unauthorised contacts with the Israeli government. Following Patel’s dismissal, a senior figure in DfID was said to have approached staff in her private offices about allegations that they had heard of bullying. The senior figure was said to have been told of multiple claims of staff being humiliated and coming under heavy pressure in emails. They then went to see another senior figure in DfID and urged them to contact the then cabinet secretary, the late Sir Jeremy Heywood, so that her conduct was recorded “in the system” if she ever returned to government. Rutnam dramatically resigned as Home Office permanent secretary on Saturday, claiming he had been subjected to a briefing campaign against him that had been condoned by Patel. He has begun legal action against the government for constructive dismissal. The Conservative party did not respond to a request for a comment."
2020-03-04T20:09:58Z,politics,Politics,Emergency coronavirus talks held on possibility of parliament closing,"Emergency talks have taken place in Westminster between the Speaker and the government’s chief medical officer about the possibility of parliament closing during the Covid-19 outbreak. The Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, is said to be concerned about the spread of the coronavirus, not only for the staff working in the building but because the Palace of Westminster is a major tourist attraction. Boris Johnson said more information could be released in the next couple of days on the advice for parliament, which employs 3,000 people, as well as for other large gatherings of people. The prime minister’s spokesperson said: “It’s not for me to speak for parliament but I’m sure parliament will itself be led by the advice of the experts in terms of taking the steps it needs in order to protect the people that work there. “Discussions are already taking place with parliamentary authorities and scientific and medical advisers.” Hoyle has had briefings from the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, and the director general of the House of Commons, Ian Ailles. The commissions of both the Commons and the Lords are due to meet on Monday, presenting another chance to discuss the virus. However, some MPs believe any talk of a parliamentary shutdown is premature and would be very difficult to implement. The Labour MP Chris Bryant, a former deputy leader of the Commons, said parliament could be doing much more to safeguard against the spread of Covid-19 before it took such a drastic step. “There are early-days measures they could do tomorrow like toilets with hot water, and it isn’t there. They should be thinking about it. There could be more hand sanitiser,” he said.
Bryant said emergency powers would also need to be voted on every 28 days and that would require MPs to come back to parliament. Another plan being considered is that Easter recess is brought forward in an effort to reduce the rate of transmission, he suggested. Before any such decision was made the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, would have to become involved. Many in the Palace of Westminster will be looking to his turn at the despatch box on Thursday for more guidance. The leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Lords, Dick Newby, said there were older peers with health issues who were considering not coming into the House of Lords. “At this moment I don’t think they are running to the hills but if there are more cases in London and they rose significantly then perhaps this could happen but I’m not aware of anybody taking that step yet,” said Lord Newby. He said he could not envisage a scenario in which the Lords was shut down but the Commons remained open, adding: “We’re not all geriatric and it will take a lot to persuade me not to come in myself.” A spokesperson for parliament said: “We are monitoring the situation closely and continue to work with the Department for Health and Public Health England. “We have taken a range of precautionary measures including placing information posters across the parliamentary estate encouraging thorough handwashing. We have been reassured by Public Health England that the steps we are taking to reduce the risk of transmission are proportionate and reasonable.”"
2020-03-04T18:27:00Z,politics,Politics,Andrea Leadsom rewrites her history in desperate dirge of denial | John Crace,"Those we haven’t loved. It’s yet to register with Andrea Leadsom that she was sacked by Boris Johnson in the February reshuffle. In her own mind she stepped down of her own accord despite repeated phone calls begging her to stay on, and no one has as yet been heartless enough to break the bad news to her. Which is how she came to make one of the least self-aware and most self-indulgent resignation speeches ever heard in the Commons. It may even catch on. Last week we had Sajid Javid’s statement, which was all the more powerful for having delivered a warning shot to Boris Johnson. Andrea’s? Not so much. But if every third-rate minister who has been fired is now going to be awarded the primetime gig after PMQs to witter on about their non-existent achievements, then the next few months could get very busy. Priti Patel should probably book her slot now to avoid any future disappointment. It looks as if she’s going to need it. After a swift jab at the former Speaker – she and John Bercow are united in their mutual loathing of one another – Leadsom settled down to a 15-minute dirge of denial. There were no telling points to be made or scores to be settled. Just a total rewrite of her career to raise it into the realms of mediocrity. It was as if someone who didn’t know her very well had been asked to give the eulogy at her funeral and was struggling to come up with anything memorable. Even her closest friends squirmed a little as she tried to pass off her two failed attempts to be party leader as an act of supreme selflessness rather than a personal embarrassment. Other Tory MPs just stared at the floor, willing it to be over. The opposition was even less kind. Though it’s customary to sit through these things in their entirety, Labour and SNP headed for the exits in their masses. Preserving their own sanity took precedence over precedent. By the end, Leadsom was pretty much talking only to herself. The story of her time in parliament. Still, the statement did serve one purpose in reminding the Tories of the bullet they had dodged. A part-time Boris was still a lot better than a full-time Andrea. Not that some Conservatives aren’t beginning to have a few second thoughts about their choice of leader. Johnson’s 80-seat majority is rather more fragile than it may seem and if he fails to deliver on his promises, he – and they – are goners. Sooner or later, Boris is going to have to do more than just bluster. Jeremy Corbyn had opened PMQs with three straight questions about the coronavirus that yet again exposed how slow the government had been to react to the threat of a pandemic. Even with the experts – much to Michael Gove’s annoyance – now onboard, Boris still doesn’t have a credible response plan if things get noticeably worse. The jibes about him being a part-time prime minister are beginning to wound. Principally because they are true. Boris has never been into anything for the long-haul. There were no answers to how already overstretched hospitals were going to cope with an extra 2 million patients. Presumably Boris expects the 40 new hospitals to build themselves, cancer patients to go into spontaneous remission, and thousands of workers who have left the NHS due to ill health and stress to volunteer to put themselves at risk of contagion. While he continues to stay safe by working from home. No need for everyone to die. Nor were his reassurances that “we haven’t yet” reached a point where the police will stop investigating murders that reassuring. Give it a few days and you can top anyone you want. That bastard who lets his dog shit on the pavement? He’s on borrowed time. As for the workings of statutory sick pay and universal credit, Boris was totally clueless. But then those are just for the skiving little people. Boris also appeared out of his depth when Corbyn switched to the ever-increasing number of bullying allegations being made against Priti Patel. He didn’t seem at all bothered about the need for an independent inquiry and just said over and over again that as far as he was concerned the home secretary could do whatever she liked as she was doing an outstanding job terrorising both her staff and immigrants. The people had voted for a bully and he had given them a bully. He wasn’t bothered how abusive or incompetent Priti was, he was going to stick by her regardless. Up until the point when he wasn’t and chose to throw her under a bus. The more Boris praised her, the more uncomfortable Patel looked. “We’ve got Brexit done,” Boris said randomly. No one on the frontbench had the heart to tell him they really hadn’t. Brexit had barely started. PMQs ended in a moment of total absurdity when the hapless Peter Bone – what have the people of Wellingborough done in a previous life to deserve an MP like him? – tried to claim that Boris’s visit to a hospital in Kettering had been done out of the media glare. It was just a total coincidence that photos of the trip had been all over the front pages of several Tory papers. Still, by then everyone was past caring. Especially Boris. He’d already done his bit for one day. In fact, he needed to be elsewhere, so he persuaded Matt Hancock to chair the Cobra coronavirus meeting in the afternoon as he had an antenatal refresher course. After all, he’d done the press conference the day before and that was more than enough for any prime minister for one week. If 600,000 people died, they died. No great biggy. Time for a lie down."
2020-03-04T18:12:34Z,politics,Politics,Rebecca Long-Bailey pledges the environment would be central to Labour policy,"Rebecca Long-Bailey would make protecting the environment a core Labour principle by writing it into the party’s constitution, she has said. The shadow business secretary has argued that Labour’s green industrial revolution, which she authored, was not prominent enough in the party’s election campaign last year. She would seek to redraw clause IV of the party’s constitution, which sets out its political aims, to include environmentalism, she said on Wednesday. “As leader, I’ll centre Labour’s plans to tackle the climate crisis in everything our party does, and make sure it defines the next election. I know that we can build a winning electoral coalition around our green industrial revolution, uniting working people everywhere with a just, aspirational response to the climate crisis,” she told the Guardian. Any changes to Labour’s constitution would have to be agreed by party members at its annual conference; however, Long-Bailey set out a series of principles that she said should guide the process of drawing up what she called a “clause IV for our time”. The first of these is “a green economy and a sustainable planet, recognising that socialism and environmentalism must go hand in hand”. Other principles include: • Universal provision of high-quality public services, including childcare, education, healthcare, housing, social care, social security, transport and utilities. • A prosperous economy with a more equal distribution of wealth, ownership and economic power. • An independent foreign policy based on peace, internationalism, human rights, justice and international law. • Expanding democracy and devolving power. Long-Bailey is widely regarded as Jeremy Corbyn’s chosen successor. He made a video alongside her last week in which the pair chatted about climate change, and he promised “absolute support” for her “green revolution”. However, Keir Starmer appears to be the frontrunner. The long leadership campaign has featured increasingly detailed policy promises, with Starmer publishing “10 pledges”, which include nationalisation of “rail, mail, energy and water” and supporting the abolition of tuition fees. Meanwhile, Lisa Nandy, the MP for Wigan, has sought to shake up the race by warning that Labour faces extinction unless it changes radically. Long-Bailey has made clear that she is committed to retaining Corbyn’s leftwing policy stance but stressed that she believes it could have been explained and promoted better during the election campaign, saying her colleagues need to become “salespeople for socialism”. And she has also emphasised widening party democracy – committing to campaign for open selection for MPs. Long-Bailey’s campaign chair, Jon Lansman, founder of the leftwing Labour group Momentum, has long advocated open selection. Clause IV was originally agreed in 1918. It was rewritten in 1995, under Tony Blair’s leadership, to eliminate the commitment to “the common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange” after a highly symbolic public battle with the trades unions.
Rethinking clause IV has already featured in Labour’s deputy leadership contest, with Richard Burgon proposing to ensure that nationalising key public services is “hard-wired into our party’s core”. Long-Bailey and Starmer will both appear in separate interviews on the BBC’s Andrew Neil show on Wednesday evening. Her campaign has challenged the frontrunner in recent days to reveal more details about his campaign funding. Jon Trickett, who is closely involved in Long-Bailey’s campaign, said on Wednesday there was a need to “end the secrecy” in an escalation of tensions over the issue of donations. Starmer committed to releasing his campaign donations in tranches on the official register of MPs’ interests but critics said these donations do not need to be officially accepted for 30 days and then they do not have to be declared for another 28 days. The register of MPs’ interests was published on Tuesday and showed Starmer’s latest tranche of donations included £100,000 from fellow barrister Robert Latham, £5,000 from another barrister, Richard Hermer, £2,500 from an individual called Iain Simpson and the cost of various hotel stays amounting to around £2,500 from a company linked to Farah Sassoon, a wealthy Labour donor. Long-Bailey and the third contender, Lisa Nandy, have both released what they say are full lists of their donations on their own websites. Corbyn announced on the morning after December’s catastrophic election result that he would not lead Labour into another general election, but insisted a “period of reflection” was necessary, rather than rushing into a contest. Voting is open in the race, with the result due to be announced at a special conference in London on 4 April."
2020-03-04T14:32:24Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson says he will 'stick by' Priti Patel under fire from Labour,"Boris Johnson has given the government’s strongest backing yet for Priti Patel in the wake of fresh bullying allegations, insisting the home secretary was doing an “outstanding job”, as Jeremy Corbyn demanded an independent inquiry into whether she had broken the ministerial code. Patel was alongside Johnson on the frontbench during prime minister’s questions as he told the Commons she was keeping the country safe by increasing the number of police officers on the streets and bringing in a system to “tackle our migration crisis”. He said: “The home secretary is doing an outstanding job: delivering change, putting police on the streets, cutting crime and delivering a new immigration system – and I’m sticking by her.” Allegations emerged on Tuesday night that the home secretary had bullied a third civil servant, her private secretary, who had to sign off from work with stress. It allegedly occurred when she was international development secretary between 2016 and 2017. Patel denies all the allegations against her. Sir Philip Rutnam dramatically resigned as Home Office permanent secretary on Saturday, claiming he had been subjected to a briefing campaign against him that had been condoned by Patel, and he has begun legal action against the government for constructive dismissal. A former aide to Patel, who was previously an employment minister at the Department for Work and Pensions, was also allegedly given a £25,000 payout after taking an overdose of prescription medicine following alleged bullying. Corbyn said the prime minister must make the findings of any investigation public, but that he was pushing for an independent procedure as the government could not be “judge and jury” on whether a cabinet member had broken the ministerial code. The Labour leader said: “Will he now commit to an independent investigation into the home secretary’s conduct led by an external lawyer and commit to a date when its findings will be made public?” Johnson replied that it was right there should be an investigation into any allegations of bullying and that is what the Cabinet Office was doing. He said it would be led by Sir Alex Allan, the prime minister’s independent adviser on ministerial standards. He said: “She is keeping this country safe by putting in record numbers of police officers. She believes in stopping the early release of offenders and she is bringing in a system to tackle our migration crisis with an Australian-style points-based system.” Hitting back at Corbyn, he added: “He would scrap stop and search. He believes in getting rid of our security services and he certainly wouldn’t tackle our immigration system.” Corbyn said: “It’s about whether he will release the findings of an investigation into the home secretary’s behaviour. A government cannot be judge and jury over its own conduct. There has to be an independent element to that investigation.” He said the fresh allegations from Patel’s time at the Department for International Development suggested a “shocking and unacceptable pattern of behaviour” across three government departments. Corbyn’s spokesperson subsequently revealed that Labour had been handed details of further questions about the home secretary’s conduct in recent days. “We have been contacted by former staff of Priti Patel saying there are additional allegations of bullying,” the spokesman said. Mocking the prime minister over his previous use of crass language to discuss wasted money, Corbyn said: “On each occasion, tens of thousands of pounds of hard-earned taxpayers’ money has been spaffed up the wall to buy their silence,” and asked Johnson whether he was aware of the allegations and if he was, why had he appointed Patel. Johnson replied: “The home secretary is doing an outstanding job. I have every confidence in her. If there are allegations, of course it’s right they should be properly investigated by the Cabinet Office and that is what is happening.”"
2020-03-04T00:26:09Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel accused of bullying a third senior civil servant,"Priti Patel has been accused of bullying a third senior civil servant when she was the secretary of state for international development. Whitehall sources told the Guardian that the home secretary, who is already reeling from allegations that she bullied her permanent secretary at the Home Office and an aide in the Department for Work and Pensions, had “harassed and belittled” staff in her private office in 2017. The allegations have been denied by sources close to Patel but will increase pressure on Boris Johnson to ask his minister to step aside while she is investigated by the Cabinet Office. Sir Philip Rutnam, who resigned dramatically on Saturday as Home Office permanent secretary, is suing the government for constructive dismissal, claiming that Patel bullied and harassed staff in the Home Office. It was claimed on Tuesday night that she also repeatedly harassed and belittled a staff member in her office at the Department for International Development (DfID). According to BBC’s Newsnight, the Cabinet Office was aware of these claims and an alleged witness from DfID said they would be willing to give evidence at Rutnam’s employment tribunal. A Tory source told the programme that members of the civil service were attacking Patel because they were trying to scupper government plans for immigration and the police. “Dark forces are trying to influence the findings of a cabinet office inquiry,” the source said. Rutnam quit after accusing Patel of orchestrating a “vicious” campaign against him, of lying about her involvement in it and of creating a climate of fear in her department. It emerged on Monday that another former aide to Patel received a £25,000 government payout after a threatened lawsuit in which the minister was named. According to the BBC, Patel was accused of shouting at the aide to “get lost” and “get out of her face”. Patel shouted at the former aide with “unprovoked aggression” before removing her from her job, a BBC report claimed. Legal correspondence alleges that the civil servant took an overdose of prescription medicine shortly after the October 2015 incident. A spokesperson for Patel said: “The home secretary completely rejects all allegations made against her.” The latest claims against the home secretary came after the prime minister’s key aide Dominic Cummings was accused of fostering a culture of bullying in Whitehall as details resurfaced of a case in which he allegedly intimidated a mandarin who received a payoff. The senior civil servant received about £25,000 in January 2013 after a lengthy grievance procedure involving Cummings, who was then Michael Gove’s special adviser at the Department for Education (DfE). Labour has accused Cummings and Gove of being behind a culture of intimidation of civil servants and has called for the inquiry into Patel to be “genuinely independent”. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said: “It is clear that Cummings and Gove had a concerning track record at the [DfE], yet now they have positions of responsibility over the whole system. “In light of this week’s events, it’s more important than ever that we get full disclosure of the facts. No inquiry will be credible without complete transparency, not just on one case but the whole culture of this government,” she said. Cummings was an adviser to Gove in the DfE in 2012 when accused along with a colleague of bullying the senior aide. A departmental investigation cleared both men, and said no disciplinary action was necessary, but the final judgment made clear that their conduct had on occasions fallen short and their behaviour “has been perceived as intimidating”. The civil servant lodged a case with a tribunal, the Observer first disclosed, where the allegations would have been heard in public, but negotiations led to an agreed financial settlement. In further indication of tensions in Downing Street, No 10 has confirmed that the special adviser who confronted Cummings over his “unkindness” at a recent meeting is leaving the government. Lynn Davidson, an aide to the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was asked to move post as part of a reshuffle of special advisers (Spads) in February, government insiders said – before she publicly upbraided Cummings over his treatment of aides. On 14 February, at the weekly Spad meeting, Davidson reportedly criticised Cummings over his approach to government advisers. The confrontation came after Sajid Javid dramatically resigned as chancellor, rather than accept that five of his aides would be sacked and their posts absorbed into a new handpicked “Spad unit” to serve the Treasury and No 10."
2020-03-03T20:40:33Z,politics,Politics,Top civil servant begins legal case against Priti Patel and Home Office,"Sir Philip Rutnam, the senior civil servant who resigned on Saturday claiming he was bullied and forced from office, has begun legal action against the government over his treatment by Priti Patel, his union has told the Guardian. Legal documents name the home secretary, the Home Office and the Cabinet Office as respondents, the FDA said. It would mean that Patel will be expected to give evidence under oath if the case comes to tribunal. The development comes as the home secretary has expressed her regret at the decision of the top civil servant at the Home Office to quit and urged staff in the department to come together as “one team”. Rutnam dramatically announced at the weekend that he was standing down as permanent secretary, claiming constructive dismissal and accusing Patel of bullying her subordinates. Soon after, the government conceded in response to an urgent question from Jeremy Corbyn that there would be an inquiry into Patel’s actions. The new set of allegations accused her of acting “without warning” and with “an unprovoked level of aggression”. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union which will back Rutnam’s claim, said he has lodged an initial complaint with the arbitration service Acas, the first stage of making a claim to a tribunal. “We can confirm that Sir Philip has commenced legal process,” he said.
Patel, who was international development secretary from July 2016 until November 2017, has been beset by a raft of reports alleging she bullied and belittled officials at both the Home Office and the Department for International Development, where she reportedly openly described staff as “fucking useless”. In claims reported by the BBC, the embattled minister was accused of shouting at a former work and pensions aide with “unprovoked aggression” before removing her from her job. Patel has sent a joint email to staff written with Rutnam’s interim successor Shona Dunn stating they cared about the wellbeing of all employees. They expressed their gratitude to the staff for their continuing hard work and “commitment to deliver the government’s priorities”. “We both deeply value the work that every person in this department does and care about the well-being of all our staff. It is therefore a time for us all to come together as one team,” they wrote. “We also recognise the importance of candour, confidentiality and courtesy in building trust and confidence between ministers and civil servants. “Both of us are fully committed to making sure the professionalism you would expect to support this is upheld.” They added: “We both regret Sir Philip’s decision to resign. He had a long and dedicated career of public service for which we thank him.” The email comes after the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove announced on Monday that there was to be an inquiry into allegations Patel had broken the ministerial code. Patel has denied any allegations of wrongdoing."
2020-03-03T20:30:44Z,politics,Politics,Keir Starmer challenged to publish all campaign donations,"A prominent supporter of Rebecca Long-Bailey has challenged Keir Starmer to release details of all donations to his Labour leadership campaign immediately, saying any further delay is “anti-democratic”. Jon Trickett, a senior ally of Jeremy Corbyn, said there was a need to “end the secrecy” in an escalation of tensions over the issue of leadership campaign donations.
Starmer, the frontrunner, committed to releasing his campaign donations in tranches on the official register of MPs’ interests but critics say these donations do not need to be officially accepted for 30 days and then they do not have to be declared for another 28 days. Long-Bailey and the third contender, Lisa Nandy, have both released what they say are full lists of their donations on their own websites. The register of MPs’ interests was published on Tuesday and showed Starmer’s latest tranche of donations included £100,000 from fellow barrister Robert Latham, £5,000 from another barrister, Richard Hermer, £2,500 from an individual called Iain Simpson and the cost of various hotel stays amounting to around £2,500 from a company linked to Farah Sassoon, a wealthy Labour donor. Starmer’s campaign said all his donations have to go through their compliance team to make sure they are properly registered with the parliamentary authorities and this is done to ensure there are no mistakes. However, Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said all candidates should release all records of their donations now, while voting in the contest was in its early stages.
“I’ve been campaigning against the influence of money in politics for years. Whether it’s in general elections or internal party elections, we need to end the secrecy,” he said. “By only publishing donations via the register, candidates can self-finance in order to delay accepting donations, allowing them to publish these later on. You don’t have to officially accept a donation for 30 days and then you don’t have to declare it for another 28 days, so it can be 58 days until it’s declared on the register, which will be after the leadership election is over. “If we’re actually serious about financial transparency, political donations need to be published by campaigns themselves in real time, rather than waiting for the register. Delaying publishing donations until people have voted is anti-democratic. Voters deserve to know what lies behind the candidates they are being asked to vote for, before they cast their vote, not afterwards.” Matt Zarb-Cousin, an aide to Long-Bailey, claimed on Twitter that Starmer’s latest release of donations would not cover the amount spent during the leadership campaign. “That all-member mailshot alone would have cost their campaign in the region of £300k. That’s the basis of questions about funding, the campaign appears to have spent a potentially unprecedented amount,” he said. Starmer has declared about £10,000 of donations from Unison previously and his campaign said it received about £100,000 from crowdfunding. Long-Bailey’s declaration shows donations of around £215,000 from Unite, more than £52,000 from the Communication Workers Union and nearly £120,000 from Momentum. Nandy’s campaign release shows just under £200,000 of donations from a variety of individual donors and the GMB."
2020-03-03T19:52:13Z,politics,Politics,Boris fails to convince with sanitised take on coronavirus | John Crace,"And… breathe. Though not too deeply. And certainly not all over anybody else. After more than six weeks of mooching around No 10 hoping the pangolins would deal with the coronavirus on their own, Boris Johnson finally broke off from his sabbatical to ease widespread concerns about a global pandemic with an emergency press conference. Don’t panic! Don’t panic! There were no face masks or breathing equipment stashed in the corner of the state room. Just hand sanitiser at the front door on the way in. This was Downing Street in full “Keep calm and carry on” mode. As Boris walked into the room, flanked by chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, his trademark smirk was replaced by the serious face. It wasn’t altogether convincing – it never is – but it was the best he could do. When you’re trying to find the right words to tell several hundred thousand people they might die, it’s probably best not to look too chipper. Don’t panic! Don’t panic! Boris began by outlining the government’s four-part strategy. Contain, delay, research and mitigate. He forgot to mention the fifth strand of “doing almost nothing”, which had been the plan up until the previous weekend. Everything was probably going to be more or less OK for most people, he continued, though for some people it would undoubtedly not be. Which was just one of those things. But try not to worry as the NHS, which was already severely overstretched and underfunded, was uniquely placed to cope with an extra 2 million patients. Don’t panic! Don’t panic! “The best thing you can do,” Boris said, “is to wash your hands with soap and hot water while singing Happy Birthday twice.” Mostly as an aspiration that you survive until your next one. Still, at least here he was on relatively strong ground. Because if there’s one thing Boris knows something about it’s washing his hands. Over the years he’s washed his hands of almost everything: family, children, friends, colleagues, morals, scruples. Pontius Boris. Having listened in silence as the prime minister tried to minimise the situation, Whitty and Vallance were left to deliver a cold dose of reality. No one could say for certain just how bad things were going to get. But it would be at least another six months before we were out of the woods, and in a worst case scenario, 80% of the country could catch the virus with a mortality rate of about 1%. The young would probably be fine. The old, not so much. Bring out your dead! It would also be handy if the UK could work closely with neighbouring countries. If only there was a Union of European countries of which we could be a part... It rapidly became clear that the government’s emergency plan was actually remarkably thin. Something that had been hastily cobbled together over a couple of days and didn’t really stand up to close examination. There was nothing on what role the army might have to play, how health and social care workers could be protected, which hospital procedures would have to be delayed and what financial provision would be made for workers in the gig economy who weren’t covered by employment law. It was all just a bit hit and hope. Don’t panic! Don’t panic! The longer the press conference went on, the more uncomfortable the prime minister looked. Boris is essentially a good time guy with a penchant for the glib one-liner. He hates being the bearer of bad news. He hates even more the idea that people might hold him responsible for the decisions that could cost lives. He just wants to keep things light and breezy. One of the things he had most liked about Brexit was that at least no one was that likely to die from it. Or not so anyone would notice. Now it was all getting just a bit too real. Boris tried to cheer people up a bit. The good news was that if the coronavirus really did get everywhere, there would be no need for isolation units or preventing overseas travel. Though it might be an idea to only visit those countries with better healthcare than on our own. There again, the shiny new blue passport did guarantee immunity from Covid-19 and all other foreign illnesses, so all was not entirely lost. “We should all basically just go about our normal daily lives,” he said, hopefully. Before telling the entire nation he had spent the last few days shaking hands with as many people who had contracted the coronavirus as possible. Whitty and Vallance perked up. They had at last tracked down “Patient Zero”. The prime minister was the UK’s own super-spreader. The man who had broken all the rules he was telling everyone else to observe. As the pair walked away from the podium, they quietly advised Boris that a spell of self-isolation might do him and the country no end of good. Besides, it wasn’t as if anyone would know the difference. After all, he was the first person on record to have started his paternity leave four months before his child was born. An hour later, Matt Hancock, delivered much the same message in a statement to the Commons. Weirdly, though, he sounded rather more convincing in saying he didn’t know what he was doing than the prime minister had. When a 12-year-old Tigger is the one with gravitas then it really is time to panic. Don’t panic! Don’t panic!"
2020-03-03T18:11:52Z,politics,Politics,Tory donor invested in firm linked to Amazon deforestation,"Crispin Odey, one of the biggest donors to Boris Johnson’s Conservative party, has invested in a Brazilian company linked to deforestation in the Amazon, the Guardian can reveal. SLC Agricola has been accused of clearing land for soy cultivation, mostly from the Cerrado ecosystem in Brazil, which is rich in wildlife and plant species and is an important carbon sink. It has requested licences to clear thousands of hectares of Cerrado land, on top of at least 30,000 hectares that it cleared between 2011 and 2017, which resulted in the Norwegian government pension fund divesting from the group. Though the company has government licences for the Cerrado land it is clearing and does not regard this clearance as deforestation, such clearances are controversial. Jair Bolsonaro’s government has drawn widespread criticism for allowing land to be cleared and burned in the Amazon and elsewhere in Brazil. Chain Reaction Research, which provides sustainable investment advice, has said SLC Agricola’s “planned deforestation and lack of zero-deforestation commitment exposes the company to a number of business risks [and] could raise concerns with equity investors”. Odey Asset Management donated £10,000 to Johnson for his leadership bid and has donated at least £1.7m to the Tories and the pro-Brexit campaign in the last decade. The company is understood to have a sizeable stake in SLC Agricola. Alasdair Cameron, an investigator at Friends of the Earth, said: “While Johnson talks of protecting and restoring the world’s ecosystems, he and his party gladly accepted donations from an investor profiting from the destruction of Brazilian forests. “The burning of tropical forests is not accidental – it is driven by the demand for soy, beef and other commodities. In the run-up to Cop26, it is worrying to see that the cosy relationship between environmentally destructive industries and UK politics is still going on.” A spokesperson for Odey Asset Management told the Guardian: “As active fund managers, we seek to invest in companies that we determine have a promising future, and one of the inputs to that evaluation is how those companies are using or adopting sustainable practices. “Brazil has formed a vital part of increased global agricultural output, that has allowed food to be cheaper in real terms than ever before, and enabled a growing global population to feed and clothe itself. SLC Agricola is a good corporate citizen that abides by relevant legislation and adopts the most modern agricultural technology to maximise yield and use land efficiently.” SLC Agricola said it had not deforested without licences and did not have a zero-deforestation policy. The company said it had converted 1,500 hectares of land to farming in the three years from 2017 to 2019, all of which was Cerrado land. The company said its current strategy was focused not on “the acquisition of raw land for conversion, as was the case in the past,” but on already developed areas and leased instead of owned land. A spokesman said: “We are in full compliance with the Brazilian forestry code, which requires us to preserve 30% of our owned land. Also, we do not have interest in planting in the Amazon, and we believe it should be preserved. There are still huge amounts of degraded pasture land to be converted into farming, and not even that will be necessary. Farming yields have been going up due to technology, which requires less and less land to produce the same amount of food.”"

In a press conference marking the publication of the plan Boris Johnson sought to reassure Britons, saying that the government was prepared for all eventualities, and that country would â€œget through [this outbreak] in good shapeâ€� and that the â€œoverwhelming majorityâ€� of people who caught coronavirus would only suffer a mild disease from which they would recover fully. At the event, where he was flanked by Prof Chris Whitty, the governmentâ€™s chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the governmentâ€™s chief scientific adviser, Johnson did not discuss how many people might die if, as expected, efforts to contain the virus fail, and he would not discuss in detail the emergency measures being considered to limit the impact of the disease. Whitty and Vallance were more forthcoming, and they confirmed that under a â€œreasonable worst case scenarioâ€� 1% of those affected could end up dying. See 12.49pm. For more on coronvirus, do read our coronavirus live blog.
Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has told MPs that in the light of the coronavirus outbreak the government may review the rule saying workers need a sick note from a GP if they need to take sick leave for more than seven days. (See 1.33pm.) Boris Johnson is to take paternity leave after the birth of his child with his partner, Carrie Symonds, in the summer. The Labour party has called for the home secretary, Priti Patel, to stand down while a lawyer-led â€œgenuinely independentâ€� inquiry is carried out into bullying allegations against her. The Conservative MP Bob Seely has asked BT to investigate whether using Huawei is compliant with its anti-slavery policy after an Australian thinktank alleged that some of the Chinese firmâ€™s subcontractors used forced labour from the countryâ€™s Muslim minority.

2020-03-03T16:15:56Z,politics,Politics,Aide who called Dominic Cummings ‘unkind’ to leave post,"Downing Street has confirmed that the special adviser who confronted Dominic Cummings over his “unkindness” at a recent meeting is leaving the government. Lynn Davidson, an aide to the defence secretary Ben Wallace, was asked to move post as part of a special advisers’ (Spad) reshuffle, in February, government insiders said – before she publicly upbraided Cummings over his treatment of aides. On 14 February, at the weekly Spad meeting, Davidson reportedly criticised Cummings over his approach to government advisers. Sources say Cummings, Johnson’s de facto chief of staff, played no role in Davidson’s departure – though one fellow aide said Cummings had referred to her as “the ex-MoD Spad” at a recent meeting. They also suggest No 10 had sought to move her to another department, either health or education. But, in a development first reported by Buzzfeed, the former Sun journalist is now expected to leave the government.
Wallace, a longtime Johnson loyalist, had been widely tipped as at risk in the reshuffle but he kept his job as defence secretary. The confrontation between Davidson and Cummings came after Sajid Javid dramatically resigned as chancellor, rather than accept that five of his aides would be sacked and their posts absorbed into a new handpicked “Spad unit” to serve the Treasury and No 10. In his resignation speech, Javid said he believed the arrangement was not in the “national interest” and chancellors needed to be able to “speak truth to power”. No 10 has taken a close interest in the role of ministerial advisers, removing or reshuffling those deemed not to be in tune with the government’s ethos – or suspected of leaking. Several aides were asked to move departments alongside last month’s cabinet reshuffle. The government announced a new approach to recruiting advisers – unusually giving the consultancy Hanbury Strategy, whose directors include the Vote Leave strategist Paul Stephenson, a role in finding applicants. It also launched a website, spadjobs.uk. Boris Johnson’s powerful director of communications, Lee Cain, would have the final say in all appointments, the government said. Cummings has previously faced criticism over what some describe as his high-handed behaviour – in particular over the controversial sacking of the media adviser Sonia Khan, who was marched out of Downing Street over leak allegations after he demanded she hand over her phone. He also drew criticism for hiring Andrew Sabisky, a temporary contractor who resigned over comments he had made about eugenics and race. Davidson could not be reached for comment."
2020-03-03T14:52:39Z,politics,Politics,Boris Johnson says he will be taking paternity leave this summer,"Boris Johnson is to take paternity leave after the birth of his child with his partner, Carrie Symonds, in the summer. When asked about the new arrival during a press conference on coronavirus on Tuesday, the prime minister said he was likely to take his entitlement to two weeks off. Dominic Raab, the first secretary of state and foreign secretary, would be the next in line to be in charge during Johnson’s absence.
Johnson announced at the weekend that he was expecting a child with Symonds and that the couple were engaged. Their spokesperson said: “The prime minister and Miss Symonds are very pleased to announce their engagement and that they are expecting a baby in the early summer.”
Johnson, 55, will become the first prime minister in 250 years to get married in office. The last child born to an incumbent PM was Florence Rose Endellion, the daughter of David and Samantha Cameron, who was born in August 2010. Cameron and Tony Blair took paternity leave while they were in office. Johnson and Symonds have been living together in Downing Street since he became prime minister in July 2019. He is not yet divorced from his second wife, Marina Wheeler, but they came to a financial settlement last month. Johnson and Wheeler have four adult children together: Lara Lettice, Milo Arthur, Cassia Peaches and Theodore Apollo. The prime minister also has a younger daughter with Helen Macintyre, an art consultant, and has repeatedly refused to answer questions about whether he has any more children."
2020-03-03T08:31:21Z,politics,Politics,Labour demands independent inquiry into Priti Patel bullying claims,"The Labour party has called for the home secretary, Priti Patel, to stand down while a lawyer-led “genuinely independent” inquiry is carried out into bullying allegations against her. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, suggested the Cabinet Office-led inquiry announced by Boris Johnson into Patel’s behaviour was not sufficiently impartial to restore public trust in the relationship between the government and the civil service. “It doesn’t necessarily have to cross the Cabinet Office inquiry, but to restore confidence in the respect that the government has for the civil servants we want a genuinely independent inquiry,” Abbott told Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday. “We’ve had other allegations come up overnight and unless you have a conclusive and independent inquiry this thing may run on to the detriment of Priti herself and the government.” She added: “I’m afraid it would be better if she stood down. We are calling on her to step down while the inquiry goes on.” Patel’s permanent secretary, Sir Philip Rutnam, quit on Saturday, accusing Patel of orchestrating a “vicious” campaign against him, of lying about her involvement in it and of creating a climate of fear in her department. On Monday, Patel was also accused of shouting at a former aide with “unprovoked aggression” before removing her from her job. The BBC reported that the aide received a £25,000 government payout after a threatened lawsuit in which Patel was named. The legal correspondence alleges the civil servant took an overdose of prescription medicine shortly after the incident in October 2015.
Abbott said the inquiry did not need to be led by a judge, a lawyer could do the job: “Someone who can be seen to be independent”. Asked if ministers were entitled to order civil servants to do what they wanted, Abbott said: “Ministers have a mandate from the electors, and this government in particular has a very fresh and emphatic mandate, but there is such a thing as a ministerial code and if the allegations against Priti Patel, both by her former permanent secretary and the more recent allegations from the woman who had to be paid off, if they are true she would be in breach of the ministerial code and have to stand down.” Supporters of Patel say she has been patronised and belittled because of her gender and race. “This is such a serious issue,” Abbott said. “This is not about things online, or to and fro with interviewers. This is about one of the great departments of state. You cannot have the home secretary at odds with her senior officials in this way.” Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, said on Monday that a cabinet inquiry falls short of the independent inquiry his members have demanded. “The government is establishing an inquiry that civil servants are expected to have trust in, whilst at the same time ministers stand at the dispatch box and pledge their confidence in the home secretary,” he said."
2020-03-03T00:01:06Z,politics,Politics,Sadiq Khan says London election will be vote on rent controls,"The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is launching his re-election campaign with a challenge to Boris Johnson to allow rent controls to be introduced if Khan wins another term in office. Khan said victory on 7 May would mean Johnson could no longer ignore demands for the policy as he would be “ignoring the democratic will of millions of Londoners”. Kickstarting his campaign at a housing estate in Hackney on Tuesday, the mayor was due to say: “The case for rent controls is now absolutely undeniable. But Tory ministers have blocked us from introducing our plans for rent controls in London and have simply said no. “That’s why today I am making the mayoral election on 7 May a referendum on rent controls – showing Londoners that I will stand up for renters. The prime minister will have to give us the powers we need, because if he refuses to do so he will be denying the express democratic will of millions of Londoners. And as we have all heard Boris Johnson repeatedly say himself, the democratic will of the people must be respected and it is not for politicians to frustrate it.” There are 2.4 million private tenants across the capital, spending on average 43% of their income on rent. Between 2010 and 2020 rent costs rose by almost a third in London, and the average private rent for a one-bed home is now more than the average for a three-bed in every other region of England.
Khan said his rent control plan would establish a new London private rent commission, with renters on its board, to implement and enforce measures to control rents. Rent control schemes exist in other major cities. In Berlin, rents are controlled both within and between tenancies. In New York City, some rents are capped by the NYC Rent Guidelines Board, and others are “stabilised” or reset between tenancies. Khan is also considering ending “no fault” evictions and increasing minimum landlord-to-tenant notice periods to four months. Caitlin Wilkinson, a policy manager at the campaign group Generation Rent, said: “London is one of the most expensive cities to be a renter on the planet. Soaring rents mean the basic necessity of a secure, safe home is out of reach for too many people. Londoners are being priced out of the neighbourhoods they grew up in or forced to leave the city altogether.” The Conservatives’ mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, claimed rent control ideas had failed where they have been tried elsewhere, leading to higher rents and longer waiting lists. He said: “This is a transparent attempt to distract from Sadiq Khan’s abysmal record on building the homes London needs. Despite being given £5bn from the government to build them, he has only delivered a tiny fraction of the new homes he promised.”"
2020-03-02T20:36:27Z,politics,Politics,Priti Patel would have preferred anyone but the Govester to defend her | John Crace,"On reflection, Priti Patel would probably have preferred almost anyone but Michael Gove to defend her reputation in the commons. A junior home office minister would have been so much better. Someone who could be bullied into taking the hit of a 45-minute punishment beating while under instructions to say nothing of any interest whatsoever. Mikey is an entirely different proposition, however. A politician mistrusted by everyone who has ever met him. Especially those who know him well. A man rejected by the Tories as their leader on two separate occasions, principally because no one could be sure he wouldn’t stab himself in the back. Give him a knife and he just can’t help himself. There will be blood. So the home secretary’s heart must have sunk when she saw that the Govester had been put up to answer Labour’s urgent question about her bullying allegations and the resignation of permanent secretary Philip Rutnam. What followed was an absolute master-class of duplicity. He began in honeyed tones. Patel was a superb minister whom he admired almost as much as he admired himself. No one does self-love quite like Gove. Then again, perhaps it’s just as well he loves himself, for no one else does. He is the bagman who inspires only fear and loathing. And just as he had lured Patel into believing she had the wholehearted confidence of both him and the prime minister, he announced – just for the hell of it – that he was opening an independent inquiry into her behaviour. Back in the Home Office, Patel held her head in her hands. She’d just been thrown under a bus. There had been no need for any of this. Boris had promised that the official line would be a full support with no comment on any of the allegations due to the impending employment tribunal. But Mikey just hadn’t been able to resist making trouble for her. Now all sorts of other allegations would inevitably tumble out of the cupboard and she was living on borrowed time. Her job was no longer nearly as safe as she had imagined. Predictably enough, another bullying claim – this one linked to a £25,000 payout – materialised a couple of hours later. Even Jeremy Corbyn seemed rather taken aback by the ease with which Gove had washed his hands of the home secretary. He contented himself with asking why the prime minister hadn’t appeared in person to answer questions on the conduct of one of his ministers and if Patel had made illegal demands of her own officials. He ended by calling for her dismissal. Gove shook his head but his eyes sparkled. There’s nothing he would like more. It was nothing personal between him and Patel. Just that he can never pass up a chance for duplicity. Treachery is his Pavlovian response. Labour MPs tried to press for a few more details. How many allegations against Patel were there? The numbers seemed to be increasing by the hour. How much had the permanent secretary been offered to keep quiet? Was Gove actually aware that bullying could be quite nuanced? That someone could be quite nice to you one day, and unpleasantly aggressive and vindictive the next? Mikey nodded with faux sincerity and humility. Westminster’s very own Uriah Heep. No one took bullying as seriously as him. No one loved Priti more than him. Now that he had undermined her, he could afford to appear more gracious. “I’ve always been happy to admit when I’m wrong,” he insisted. Cue a moment’s silence. It has never once occurred to Gove that he might be wrong about anything. Not even the odd coke binge. With the de facto deputy prime minister having effectively disowned the home secretary, it was left to Tory backbenchers – all of whom were reading off a crib sheet handed out by a lone government whip – to belatedly come to Patel’s rescue. Mark Francois and Bill Cash who had been first to complain about John Bercow’s alleged bullying behaviour were now adamant that a spot of light bullying was fair game, and that civil servants ought to man up a bit. Most bizarre, though, was new Tory Dehenna Davison, who said that her constituents didn’t give a toss about bullying just so long as the government clamped down on immigration. So as far as she was concerned, Patel could do whatever she liked. The intellectually-challenged Tim Loughton rather agreed. The prime minister had more than enough on his hands not doing anything much about the coronavirus, floods and Brexit – the ante-natal refresher courses were taking up a lot of his time – so it was entirely appropriate that he should do nothing much about bullying. Mikey smiled. He’d done enough damage already; he could afford to be ingratiating. “We’ve got a good deal,” he oozed. “We’ve got Brexit done.” He was going to get a hell of a shock when he got back to his office and discovered the trade negotiations had only just started, and Boris was actively planning for a no deal."
2020-03-02T18:53:26Z,politics,Politics,Corbyn attacks 'government led by bullies' as Cabinet Office inquiry announced into Priti Patel  – as it happened,"The Cabinet Office is to launch an inquiry into explosive claims that Priti Patel lied and bullied officials in several government departments, Michael Gove has told MPs. See 5.11pm for an analysis of how serious this is for Patel. An overwhelming majority of doctors fear the NHS is not well prepared to deal with a major outbreak of coronavirus, a survey has found. There is full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak on our separate live blog.

Thanks for the comments."
2020-03-02T15:53:18Z,politics,Politics,"US-UK trade deal: PM eyes three-course meal, but may end up with packet of crisps","It was supposed to be one of the biggest Brexit dividends. According to Liz Truss, an “ambitious and comprehensive” trade agreement with Donald Trump would reflect Britain’s unique relationship with the US, cutting red tape and tariffs to help British businesses and the economy grow. The value to the nation: at most, an economy 0.16% bigger after 15 years. In the cold language of economic benefits, such a small number is almost a rounding error. The gains in cash terms are roughly £3.4bn under the best-case scenario, an amount worth less than the current annual contribution of Brentwood or Bury. Set in the context of the potential costs from erecting tough trade barriers with the EU, or leaving the bloc on World Trade Organization terms (an Australia-style trade agreement, in the language of government), the numbers are even more stark. Compared with the plan to add a small town’s worth of economic output to Britain over 15 years, failure to strike an EU trade deal would result in an economy 7.6% smaller than under current arrangements, over the same timeframe. That’s according to the most recent official economic impact assessment published by the government, late in 2018, when Theresa May was forced to reveal official forecasts. At the time, the report also suggested that a Canada-style deal – of the type sought by Boris Johnson – would still leave the UK about 4.9% worse off. To repurpose a comment made two years ago by Sir Martin Donnelly, once the most senior civil servant at the department under Liam Fox, as he assessed the prospects for British trade outside the EU: such a plan is akin to swapping a three-course meal for a packet of crisps.
Of course this is not the government’s stated intention. Free trade deals are wanted with the US, the EU and other nations – keep the three-course meal, crisps, and eat the lot. But carrying out negotiations in parallel may eventually force Johnson’s hand towards making tough choices. Any deal with the US could influence any deal with the EU. It will be imperative for both to know what Britain wants, putting Johnson in a bind, even should he aim to play one off against the other. One perhaps surprising point about the latest government analysis is the seemingly frank assessment of the limited benefits. This suggests the trade department was either not leant on, or refused to be cajoled into producing trumped-up estimates, according to Dr Peter Holmes, an academic at the UK Trade Policy Observatory at Sussex University. “They are in line with the standard results,” he says, adding that such small gains probably reflect the relatively low tariff barriers between the US and the UK at present. The trade department estimates US tariffs on UK exports are worth about £493m, out of a relationship worth a total £220.9bn. It could also reflect that non-tariff barriers – the red tape that Truss says she would like ripped apart – can be particularly tough to get rid off, especially should Britain refuse to bend to every demand made by Trump, and vice versa. Truss warns that any deal must protect the NHS (the health service is firmly “not on the table” in Monday’s document) and also uphold the UK’s “very high standards on food safety and animal welfare”. The clock though is ticking. Johnson has set a deadline of the end of 2020 for an agreement with the EU, do or die. Trump will undoubtedly want to show progress before the US elections in the autumn. Tougher and more detailed decisions over Britain’s post-Brexit trade priorities will soon need to be made."
2020-03-02T12:45:11Z,politics,Politics,British economy 'to grow 0.16% at best under US trade deal',"The British economy would be at most 0.16% larger by the middle of the next decade under a comprehensive trade deal with the US, the government has admitted, laying bare the limited benefits from striking an agreement with Donald Trump. In a Department for International Trade (DIT) document, designed to kick-start post-Brexit trade talks with the White House, the government said the British economy stood to benefit from an “ambitious and comprehensive” trade deal worth a fraction of GDP, equivalent to £3.4bn after 15 years.
Prompting warnings from economists that the benefits would be far outstripped by the losses from crashing out of the EU, the official analysis also showed that a more limited trade deal with the US would deliver benefits to the UK economy worth just 0.07% by the middle of the 2030s, or about £1.4bn. The government had previously estimated the economy would be as much as 7.6% smaller should Britain leave the EU without a deal, and about 4.9% smaller under Boris Johnson’s preferred Canada-style agreement. Dr Peter Holmes, an academic at the UK Trade Policy Observatory at Sussex University, said: “The numbers are very small. It just goes to show how tiny the gains are from a free trade agreement with the US compared to losing our present arrangements with the EU.” Outlining the start of deeper talks with Washington, the UK government insisted it would not water down animal welfare standards or put the NHS up for sale to secure a trade deal with Trump. However, the US trade representative Robert Lighthizer, speaking at an event in Oxford, immediately poured cold water on several aspects of the UK’s negotiating position. He said he hoped the UK “doesn’t just adopt European standards” that ban the practice of washing chicken in chlorine or acid, and claimed the practice was a “labelling question” not a food health question. “The US and the UK are not going to go separate ways based on chicken,” he told the Oxford Union. He accepted that the UK was sensitive about access to the NHS but said it should be open to it. “We would expect that we should have access in the healthcare area to the respect that there’s private section competition,” he said. He also dismissed the estimates of low economic growth in the UK negotiation paper, saying: “You can be fairly certain that whatever numbers people come up with they are not going to be accurate.” The DIT document says the government is aiming to reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade, but without compromising standards.
Fears have been expressed that the UK is preparing to water down standards in areas including food production – for example on allowing imports of chlorinated chicken. But the document reiterates the Conservatives’ manifesto commitment that “in all of our trade negotiations, we will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards”. Ending the ban on genetically modified (GM) food in the UK, which could lead to cheaper produce on supermarket shelves, was not explicitly ruled out in the document. Officials are said to be expecting to go into talks with the US backing up the pre-existing UK ban and the government noted GM food was not popular with some of those they consulted with. It also insists that NHS drugs prices will not be up for negotiation, saying explicitly: “The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. The services the NHS provides will not be on the table.” However the US negotiating mandate, published last year, pointed to public services as one area for potential liberalisation. Talks around securing a new trade deal are expected to take several years, which may see conversations going beyond the president’s “fast track authority” period, which runs until June 2021. This means he can avoid Congress filibustering or amending a treaty struck with another country. The document is being published on the same day that negotiations with the EU27 in Brussels over the future relationship kick off. Truss had argued the two processes should run simultaneously, believing that would maximise the UK’s leverage. The government stresses the potential advantages of a deal, including potentially boosting exports of salmon, cheddar cheese and cars, claiming that “removing trade barriers with the US could deliver huge gains”."
2020-03-02T12:43:05Z,politics,Politics,Key points: what the UK wants in a US trade deal,"The UK government has set out its objectives for a trade deal with the US in a 167-page document from the Department for International Trade. What is it all about? The European Union does not have a trade deal with the US although there have been several attempts to strike one. Outside the confines of the EU, the UK cannot strike out on its own. Currently UK-US trade is worth £221bn, 20% of exports, the document notes. Government analysis suggests it could increase by £15.8bn. It believes wages can get a long-term bounce worth £1.8bn from a US deal. There are also 1 million British people working in US companies and the same number vice versa. Who could benefit? The UK says it is seeking to maximise its reach in global data and artificial intelligence, in line with the Conservative party’s manifesto. It also cites professional services, food processing and car manufacturing – the Mini is a big seller in the US – as beneficiaries. Removing trade barriers, including tariffs, could “deliver huge gains, especially for the 30,000 small- to medium-sized enterprises already trading with the US”.
What does it mean for the NHS? Just months after the Labour party accused the government of putting the NHS on the negotiating table, the government has pledged to keep it out of US hands. In clear language on page one, it says: “The NHS will not be on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. The services the NHS provides will not be on the table. “The NHS is not, and never will be, for sale to the private sector, whether overseas or domestic. Any agreement will ensure high standards and protections for consumers and workers, and will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards.” What about chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef The debate about chlorinated or lactic-acid-washed chicken were never about food safety but about the lower animal welfare standards and lack of regulations in the US where industrial scale farming can involve practices long outlawed in the EU. BBC and Channel 4 The UK would protect the right to regulate public services, including the NHS and public service broadcasters. Which parts of the UK could benefit and how? Northern Ireland Exports of furniture, machinery and pharmaceuticals could rise. Scotland A free trade agreement could bolster exports of Scottish whisky and salmon, cashmere and “high quality meat”. Midlands One in five exports from the Midlands go to the US. Ceramic manufacturers and drink exporters have been singled out as potential beneficiaries. North of England Sheep farmers, dairy producers and car manufacturers could benefit. Wales Lamb is big in Wales and most exports go to places like France and the Middle East. A deal with the US could open up a vast market for sheep farmers. The document also suggests there could be benefits for Welsh steel and ceramics. South-west A reduction in tariffs could help dairy and beef farms, while an easing of customs barriers could benefit luxury sports manufacturers and those making marine equipment and beverages. East of England Medicinal products and the life sciences would be the key beneficiaries. London and the south-east Professional services, digital trade and UK tech firms would benefit. What products does the UK want to sell to the US? Data, driverless cars and quantum technology would blossom if the UK had preferential access to the US, according to the report. The UK also thinks professional services, including architecture and law, could benefit. If the US dropped its tariffs on products such as cheddar cheese, which has a 17.6% levy, dairy producers could benefit. Textiles, cars, ceramics and creative industries are also earmarked for the negotiation. Did the public have a say? More than 700 individuals expressed concerns about competition, with more than 200 of them being worried about the potential for the UK to become a dumping ground for cheap US imports. What does it mean for tariffs? The UK is looking for the US to lower its tariffs, with the report specifically mentioning the punitive tariffs imposed following the World Trade Organization’s ruling on government subsidies to Airbus. “The UK continues to support a negotiated settlement to Airbus and Boeing.” About 62% of all goods exported from the US to the UK, and 42% of all UK goods exported to the US, are supply-chain components, so the lowering of tariffs will make production cheaper for all."
2020-03-02T09:40:11Z,politics,Politics,EU warns UK to tone down political rhetoric as trade talks start,"The EU is urging Britain to drop the “political rhetoric” around Brexit as historic talks on the future trading relationship open in Brussels. As an army of 100 officials led by Britain’s chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, descend on the Belgian capital on Monday, senior EU diplomats are warning that if the political temperature continues to rise over Brexit in the UK it will risk smothering talks. They are concerned about the political relationship between the UK and the EU, characterised by furious language including warnings that each side will “rip” each other apart, and the second relationship – that among officials tasked with examining the deeper, drier technical complexities of disentangling and reimaging 47 years of joint laws and regulations.
As soon as the debate around Brexit moves to the “tunnel” of technical detail and away from the politics, the quicker a space can be opened up for a deal, say sources. They warn the agreement will affect people and business across 28 countries and it behoves both sides to get away from politics and do a good deal for both sides. The deadline to reach a deal is the end of the year, with key elements including fishing rights, due to be resolved by 1 July, leaving just three months for the opposing sides to resolve headline differences for a “stocktake” in mid-June. Detailed negotiations on potential tariffs are impossible in this timeframe. That means the only way to get a deal is to have close alignment on regulations on both sides, said a source. They said the most contentious issues will not be tariffs, quotas and market access but “governance and dispute resolution”, given that the UK has comprehensively rejected any role for the European institutions or the European court of justice.
Among the issues slated as easier to resolve are transport, chemical waste and Horizon Europe, the science research programme. The EU is said to have abandoned any hope of “dynamic alignment” whereby the UK would agree to abide closely to EU regulations as they evolved in coming years. That is now considered a dead topic, following the publication of the UK’s trading mandate last week. Fisheries, so emblematic on the British side of the leave vote, is expected to be one of the trickiest issues politically with Denmark, France, Spain, the Netherlands and Ireland insisting on continued access to British waters. The two sides have already clashed over the issue but EU sources say they don’t need a full agreement by July, merely an outline of a deal which will give a “hint” to the fishing communities that their 2020 fishing rights are secure. The areas to be discussed on Tuesday and Wednesday are: trade in goods; trade in services; transport energy and civil nuclear co-operation; fisheries; a level playing field for open and fair competition; law enforcement and judicial co-operation; participation in union programmes; mobility and social security; cooperation in programmes such as Horizon Europe; and governance and dispute resolution. According to the agenda, published by the EU, the talks will start with a meeting of lead negotiators on Monday, moving to an opening plenary session at 4.30pm. The group is so large that from Tuesday negotiators will be moved from the Berlaymont headquarters of the European commission to a conference centre. The talks will be split into 11 groups covering everything from trade and nuclear energy to fisheries and state aid. This week’s talks will be the first of 10 rounds that will take place every three weeks, alternating between Brussels and London."

Transport for London’s £1bn twin-bore tunnel is expected to take five years to build and the organisation claims it will speed up river crossings for cars and vans and reduce congestion. Benita said no work should start on the project until the mayoral election on 7 May was out of the way and if she won she would axe it immediately. The Green party is also calling for it to be abandoned and the climate emergency group Extinction Rebellion has staged protests and is expected to carry out more in the coming months. “Going ahead is an environmental betrayal. It will mean a disastrous increase in cars, congestion and pollution at the very moment when we should be moving in the exact opposite direction,” Benita said, as she promised to stand on the greenest ever Lib Dem platform. Sadiq Khan, who is running for a second term with a series of new environmental targets, has said the tunnel is needed to vastly improve air quality, especially around the entrances to the nearby Blackwall tunnel, where car engines are often idle, and the number of vehicles overall is not expected to increase. He has said new river crossings in east London are also urgently needed to ease congestion and reliability as the Blackwall tunnel was closed 700 times in 2017-18. Benita said: “There’s nothing more important than tackling the climate crisis and for me in order to achieve that it means every single policy coming out of City Hall should be done through a green lens. “To do that we need to start with some very basic assumptions: that we need a car and vehicle reduction target in the city, which very quickly undermines the business case for the Silvertown tunnel. Despite everything Sadiq Khan is saying, if you build a new tunnel you will get more cars. “I wouldn’t be investing in Silvertown and I’d be reversing that decision,” she said. The London borough of Newham, where one of the tunnel’s entrances will be built, is the most polluted borough in Britain and its fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, count exceeds World Health Organization guidelines. Discouraging car use in London and for people to switch to walking and public transport should be the focus of any future infrastructure project, Benita said. “We shouldn’t be building any more infrastructure that leads to more cars.” Environmental campaigners have claimed for years that the new tunnel will exacerbate traffic problems because it will attract new cars and lead to more pollution. Instead the money could be invested in cycling and trying to make car-sharing work much more effectively in London, Benita suggested. She also wants the legislation for electric scooters to be rolled out as soon as possible, and for cargo bikes to be used for deliveries with a better coordination of goods being moved around the capital. A London Labour spokesperson said: “Sadiq is standing up for London by cleaning up its toxic air and addressing the climate emergency. He is promising a green new deal for London and has an ambitious target for the city to be carbon neutral by 2030. “The mayoral election on 7 May is a two-horse race between Sadiq Khan and Boris Johnson’s Tory candidate. That’s why Sadiq is asking Liberal Democrats and other progressives to lend him their vote so he can continue standing up for our city and its values.” City Hall under Khan has backed the tunnel, which will be subject to a toll, as will the Blackwall tunnel, which is currently free to use. The extension of the ultra-low emission zone area in 2021 will also cover the Silvertown tunnel entrance and exit so drivers must have low-polluting vehicles or pay £12.50. The crossing will also have a dedicated bus lane with up to 37 zero-emissions buses an hour in each direction. Benita ran as an independent candidate in 2012 and came within 8,000 votes of the Lib Dem candidate, Brian Paddick."
