2015-01-02T22:26:10Z,us-news,US news,"New York hospital lets British couple off hook for '$200,000 bill' after early birth","A British couple who feared a $200,000 (£130,000) medical bill after their baby was born 11 weeks premature while they were on vacation in New York breathed a little easier on Friday as the hospital caring for their son said it would “ensure that there will be no financial impact to the family”. Katie Amos and Lee Johnston’s baby, Dax, reportedly born weighing 3lbs, is in the neonatal intensive care unit at Lenox Hill hospital in Manhattan. On Friday, a hospital statement said: “Lenox Hill Hospital continues to work with the insurance carrier regarding payment approvals for all services rendered by the hospital, anesthesia and physician services from their insurance carrier. We will ensure that there will be no financial impact to the family. “In addition, our staff has been going above and beyond to ease the overall experience for the family, from arranging a place to live for the duration of their stay to helping them communicate with their family in the UK.” By Friday afternoon a fundraising page – started in an effort to help Amos and Johnston – entitled “Dax’s Tale of New York” had raised $9,577.68 (£6,248). Earlier, the couple’s friend Richard Crow wrote on a Facebook page of the same name: “Great news! I believe I can confirm that all medical bills will be covered! It’s been a long wait but well worth it! Due to the publicity that has gone on around the whole story, it has forced them to pay!” The Facebook page had garnered more than 13,600 likes. Amos and Johnston, from Lincolnshire, said they were told by doctors their bill could reach $200,000, as they would have to stay in hospital until 10 March, when Dax would be cleared to travel to the UK. The baby was reportedly born 28 December. Crow said he started the fundraising page because people wanted a way to help the young couple out. He said Johnston and Amos had not asked him to do so. “I am running it. Neither Lee [nor] Katie have asked for any money”, he wrote. “Myself and a few good friends got together to see what we could do to help them. It was only really to be a local thing. It was decided we would start a FB page and I said I would run it. It was also my decision to do the page as baby Dax.” Crow’s efforts attracted significant publicity, including support from the British model Katie Price. Crow said the money raised would be used to support the couple during their extended stay in New York, as Johnston is self-employed and Amos receives only basic maternity pay. He said an airline had agreed to honor the couple’s return flight to the UK when they were ready to leave New York. Crow said the new parents would donate any remaining money to the Ronald McDonald Fund, which has provided temporary housing while Dax is in hospital. He also offered donors the chance to ask for their money back if they felt “cheated” or if they had misunderstood the situation – he said the fundraising effort had not been intended to reach the $200,000 figure quoted for the couple’s medical bills. The couple did not have travel insurance, but had received clearance from their doctor to fly, Crow said, before they undertook their five-day trip to New York. Dax was born after Amos went into labour during a movie tour of Central Park. Crow said both parents and Dax were well and immensely grateful for the support. “Dax is doing fine,” Crow wrote on Facebook. “Lee got to feed him yesterday for the first time, though I understand it is an [unconventional] task!!! They seem in better spirits now due to … the support back here.”"
2015-01-02T22:16:15Z,us-news,US news,Senate minority leader Harry Reid breaks ribs and facial bones in accident,"The incoming Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, broke several ribs and bones in his face in an accident while exercising at his Nevada home, his office said on Friday. The senior Democrat from Nevada was treated at University Medical Center in Las Vegas, which he left on Friday afternoon. Reid’s office said doctors expected the 75-year-old to make a full recovery. Spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said the senator was “ready to get back to work” and had gone home to Henderson, prior to returning to Washington this weekend ahead of the Senate reconvening on Tuesday. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said President Barack Obama had called Reid “to wish him a full and speedy recovery” and was glad to hear the senator was doing well. Reid was exercising at his home in Henderson, Nevada, south-east of Las Vegas, when he had the accident. “A piece of equipment Senator Reid was using to exercise broke, causing him to fall and break a number of ribs and bones in his face,” his office said in a press release. “Senator Reid will return to Washington this weekend and be in the office Tuesday as the Senate prepares to reconvene. His doctors expect a full recovery. “Senator Reid was first brought to St Rose Dominican Hospital in Henderson by his security detail. He was then transferred to UMC for further testing, where he was admitted overnight as a precaution.” One colleague, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, tweeted: “Now there’s a man serious about new year’s resolutions! Get well soon, @SenatorReid. See you back in DC.” In October 2012, Reid suffered rib and hip injuries in a car crash. In 2011, a fall resulted in a dislocated shoulder and a bump to the head. In the November midterm elections, Democrats ceded control of the Senate to Republicans, ending Reid’s tenure as majority leader, which began in 2007. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky will assume that role next week."
2015-01-02T21:08:27Z,us-news,US news,Obama imposes new sanctions against North Korea in response to Sony hack,"The US has imposed economic sanctions against several North Korean government agencies and senior officials in retaliation for the country’s alleged role in hacking Sony Pictures’ systems and threatening US moviegoers. Despite some continued claims from outside the US government that the hack may have been the work of disgruntled employees instead, the White House on Friday followed through on its threat to seek revenge, blaming the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea for “provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies, particularly its destructive and coercive cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment”. Following an executive order by Barack Obama, the US Treasury has designated three state-run organisations and ten North Korean government officials for specific actions, including the country’s intelligence agency, an arms exporter and a defence procurement agency. “Today’s actions are driven by our commitment to hold North Korea accountable for its destructive and destabilizing conduct,” said Treasury secretary Jack Lew in a statement. “Even as the FBI continues its investigation into the cyber-attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment, these steps underscore that we will employ a broad set of tools to defend US businesses and citizens, and to respond to attempts to undermine our values or threaten the national security of the United States.” A separate statement from the White House added: “We take seriously North Korea’s attack that aimed to create destructive financial effects on a US company and to threaten artists and other individuals with the goal of restricting their right to free expression.” “As the president has said, our response to North Korea’s attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment will be proportional, and will take place at a time and in a manner of our choosing. Today’s actions are the first aspect of our response.” The US says its latest actions are designed to complement existing sanctions against these government entities that were introduced previously in response to nuclear proliferation and “illicit financial activity”, and not a sign that it believes these were specifically the agencies or individuals directly involved in the latest hack. Nevertheless, a senior administration official told reporters in a phone briefing that the FBI continued to be adamant that North Korea was to blame for the attack, insisting independent experts questioning its theory were limited in number and did not have access to the same information. “We are standing by our assessment,” said one US official. The White House also insists that the sanctions, though barring only limited further commercial engagement with the already heavily-isolated state, were a significant step because they were the first time it has retaliated for cyber-attacks against a company. Asked if this meant the US was effectively denying rumoured involvement in internet outages in North Korea last month after the Sony hack first came to light, administration officials refused to comment on any “covert activity”."
2015-01-02T20:47:14Z,us-news,US news,Flu reaches epidemic proportions this season â€” but that's not unusual,"Influenza has reached epidemic proportions in the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported this week, as 2014 ended with 15 children reported killed by the virus. Since 28 September, experts at the federal agency have confirmed 28,218 cases of influenza around the US. Thirty-six states reported widespread virus activity, 22 of them experiencing high infection rates and nine reporting deaths. The south and midwest have had a particularly tough season, with three deaths in Texas and hospitals issuing warnings to parents in Michigan and Kansas. Only halfway through the flu season, the CDC predicts influenza strains will infect every state and US territory by the end of spring. It cautioned, however, that the 2014-15 flu season should not yet be compared with previous years. Dr Michael Jhung, one of the CDC’s experts on influenza, told the Guardian there was no reason yet to believe that the 2014-15 flu season is unusual. “We are in an epidemic of flu, but we have epidemics of flu every year,” he said. The flu crosses the threshold of epidemic levels almost every year in the US, as strains mutate and the CDC rolls out new vaccines to meet the changed viruses. As of the CDC’s last assessment, the current flu season is at the threshold of an epidemic. “There’s a suggestion that it may be a more severe season,” Jhung said, since “the most common virus of this season, the H3N2 virus, has been associated with more severe seasons in the past.” Jhung characterized those H3N2 years as “moderately severe”, and said this season was shaping up to look like those years. But he cautioned that the flu season could change dramatically before the end of May. “The common line of ‘If you’ve seen one flu season then you’ve seen one flu season’ really applies,” he said. “Things could change in the next week or the next month, and we could end up with a mild season, or with a different dominant virus.” In December, the CDC warned that this year’s flu vaccine would be less effective than usual due to a strain’s mutation during the production of the shot. Agency director Dr Tom Frieden advised hospitals that the season could be more severe, since the vaccine, which covers several variants, is a mismatch with the virus circulating most widely. Flu seasons tend to be unpredictable: in the past decade as few as 37 people have died one season and as many as 171 the next. In only one year in recent memory has influenza reached pandemic proportions, when the strain of H1N1 “swine flu” swept through the US in 2009. That year, as in 2014, variant strains “drifted” genetically and antigenically – meaning they mutated to evade a host’s defenses – at just the right time to slip past researchers developing a vaccine. The CDC helped decide what would be in this year’s flu vaccine in February, and production takes about four months; the H3N2 strain mutated just enough in March to reduce the vaccine’s effect. “The vaccine’s different, but similar enough so there’s protection afforded,” Jhung said, “and it will still provide very good protection for the other flu viruses still out there.” The CDC will not know until April or May whether the 2014-15 season is worse than others, because deaths and hospitalizations are only two means of gauging a season and are reported slowly, and because the CDC does not require hospitals report adult deaths. For that reason, the CDC says it may simply be an unusually early season, rather than a more severe one. This year’s dominant strain of H3N2, however, does “tend to have more hospitalizations and more deaths”, Frieden warned in December. With months left before infections wane and a few strains well protected by the vaccine, Jhung recommended that people at risk – children under two, adults over 65 and people with medical conditions – quickly get antiviral medications from a doctor should they fall ill with the flu. Such medications “work to prevent the virus from replicating in the body”, he said, meaning that the flu can be kept in check before it has a chance to overwhelm an already vulnerable immune system. Most children who die from influenza-related causes were not vaccinated, the CDC has found. Frieden advised in December that preventative measures as simple as staying home would help reduce infection rates and be better for sick people."
2015-01-02T20:20:41Z,us-news,US news,California roller rink shooting leaves security guard dead and two wounded,"Police are hunting gunmen who fired at a crowd of revellers at a southern California roller rink early on New Year’s Day, killing a security guard and wounding two other men. The attack happened shortly before 2am in the parking lot at Cal Skate in Grand Terrace, between Riverside and San Bernardino, where about 200 people, including children, were attending an all-night party to celebrate the new year. Richard Williamson, 48, a guard who owned the company providing security for the event, reportedly returned fire. He was hit and taken to a nearby hospital where he died. “I woke up, to my amazement, and saw muzzle flashes, coming from both sides of the parking lot,” Michael Marcoly, a driver who was sitting in his big-rig in the parking lot when the gunfire broke out, told KNBC-TV. “I saw people scattering. It’s really hard for me to say, but I saw the security officer go down, and he died a hero. He saved a bunch of kids and families, no doubt in my mind.” Marcoly thought the melee was part of the event before he realised live rounds were being fired at the crowd. “At first, I thought it was just people celebrating the new year, firing guns,” he said. “Then, when it hit my truck, it rocked my truck.” Two other men, including a guard employed by Williamson, were wounded. The men were ages 22 and 28; one was treated at the scene and the other was taken to a hospital. Their names were not released. The San Bernardino County sheriff’s office said in a statement no arrests had been made: “The suspects remain outstanding and investigators are asking anyone who may have witnessed the shooting to contact investigators.” The skating rink said in a statement it was working with investigators. “Our prayers are with the officer and who was involved and those who witnessed this tragic event,” the statement said. Williamson owned Big Will’s Security Services, a Riverside-based firm which provided the guards for the party. Tributes posted on Facebook said he had a big heart and worked hard. “He was just a very cool guy [who] had a big personality,” said Ray Dillick, who worked at the Riverside Indoor Shooting Range. “Always talking with us at the range and would tell us to stay safe.”"
2015-01-02T18:43:28Z,us-news,US news,Mario Cuomo embodied our hopes for a liberal presidency that never was,"At the 1984 Democratic Convention in San Francisco – a wan gathering of a doomed political party – New York governor Mario Cuomo delivered a full-throated liberal response to triumphant President Ronald Reagan. Eloquently challenging conservative go-it-alone economics, Cuomo defined the Democratic Party’s credo as the shared obligations of a family: “We are bound one to another.” Cuomo’s oration, which produced visible tears among Democratic delegates, may well have been the greatest American convention address of modern times. Certainly, it ranks with a defeated Ted Kennedy’s “the dream shall never die” speech in 1980 and the 2004 convention keynote address by a little-known Illinois state senator named Barack Obama. Cuomo, who served three terms as governor but never moved beyond his flirtations with running for president, died on New Year’s Day afternoon at age 82 from a heart condition. Although he was one of the longest-serving governors in New York history, his legacy has little to do with what he accomplished in office. Rather he is mourned today because of all the hopes that he embodied for a liberal presidency that never was. Just five hours before this towering figure in late 20th-century politics died, his son and more politically moderate heir Andrew Cuomo delivered his second inaugural address as New York’s governor. In his speech on Thursday, the younger Cuomo said, “He couldn’t be here physically today ... but my father is in the room.” Unlike the old-money Bushes and the glamorous Kennedys, there was nothing about Mario Cuomo’s origins to suggest that he would launch a political dynasty. Too Italian-American and too outer-borough Born in the depths of the Depression to immigrant parents from southern Italy who did not speak English, Cuomo grew up in Queens, a New York City borough filled with multi-ethnic strivers. He attended Catholic schools and then St John’s University in Queens for his undergraduate education and law school. Despite being tied for first in his law-school class, Cuomo discovered that he was too Italian-American and too outer-borough to get a job with an elite Manhattan law firm. These slights from 1950s America stayed with Cuomo all his life. Practicing law in Queens, he gained a reputation for successfully mediating a racially charged dispute over the size of a public housing development in 1972. Trying to use his news clippings as a springboard, Cuomo lost a statewide primary election for lieutenant governor in 1974 and then was defeated by Ed Koch in the contentious 1977 New York City mayoral campaign. The emblematic moment in Cuomo’s successful 1982 race for governor came in a televised debate when he called attention to his wealthy Republican rival’s luxurious gold watch. Even as he reflected the resentments of middle-class New Yorkers, Cuomo became known as a governor who elevated principle over politics. During a crime-ridden decade, he challenged the simplistic belief in capital punishment and vetoed popular legislation to restore the state’s death penalty. But that was pretty much all that non-New Yorkers knew about Cuomo when he took center stage in San Francisco on 16 July 1984. Making a distinction between the two parties that still resonates 30 years later, Cuomo said, “The Republicans believe that the wagon train will not make it to the frontier unless ... the weak are left by the side of the trail ... We Democrats believe that we can make it all the way with the whole family intact.” In 1896, on the strength of a speech as powerful as Cuomo’s, the Democrats nominated William Jennings Bryan for president. But by 1984, conventions no longer had a will of their own and had become television spectacles. Which is why Democrats in San Francisco dutifully stuck with Walter Mondale, who went on to lose 49 states to Reagan. With that convention speech and, two months later, an adroitly argued Catholic defense of abortion rights at Notre Dame University, Cuomo created a national clamor for him to run for president as a liberal champion. But Cuomo took himself out of the running long before the 1988 campaign and the Democrats went on to lose their third landslide election in a row as George HW Bush routed Michael Dukakis. But 1992 was Cuomo’s year – or so the political touts thought. But the three-term governor dithered and delayed so much that he was ridiculed as “Hamlet on the Hudson.” On the filing day for the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary, with a plane waiting on the tarmac to fly him there to hand in his nominating petitions, Cuomo bowed out for the last time. What if... Cuomo insisted (though it never sounded convincing) that he would have run if it were not for a budget impasse with the New York state legislature. And maybe he could have beaten Bill Clinton, even in a year when the Democrats looked south and to the center in choosing a nominee. But there was always the sense that the thin-skinned Cuomo, a politician who hated to travel, knew that his urban style and urbane rhetoric was not suited for a marathon national race for the White House. Cuomo resisted one more turn of ambition’s wheel: In 1993, he allowed Clinton to seriously consider him for the supreme court and then – in characteristic style – took himself out of the running at the last minute. Instead, he stubbornly ran for a fourth term as governor in 1994 and lost to George Pataki, a little-known state legislator, in that year’s Republican tidal wave. The enigmatic and sometimes exasperating Cuomo had a long career near the center of American political life. But his true moment of glory came at that otherwise-forgotten 1984 convention when he defined - for then and now - what it means to be a liberal. Walter Shapiro has covered the last nine presidential campaigns. He is currently a lecturer in political science at Yale University and a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU."
2015-01-02T18:42:25Z,us-news,US news,"Girlfriend of John Crawford, man killed by police in Walmart, dies in car crash","The girlfriend of John Crawford, the young man who was shot dead by police while holding a pellet gun and speaking on his cellphone in an Ohio supermarket last year, has been killed in a car crash. Tasha Thomas died on New Year’s Day when the car she was travelling in struck a pole in Dayton at high speed and overturned, according to police. The driver, Frederick Bailey, died soon after at a hospital.
Thomas, who was 26, was shopping with Crawford at the Walmart in Beavercreek, a Dayton suburb, in August last year when Crawford was shot dead by a police officer. The officer was responding to a 911 call from a customer who said Crawford was pointing a gun at passersby. Last month the Guardian disclosed that Thomas was aggressively questioned by police after the shooting. A detective accused her of lying, threatened to send her to jail, and suggested that she was high on drugs before telling her that Crawford, 22, was dead. “It’s just tragic,” Michael Wright, the attorney for Crawford’s family, said on Friday of Thomas’s death. “It is a sad set of circumstances continuing from what happened at Walmart.” Wright, who advised Thomas soon after the shooting, said that her death had been confirmed to him by Anthony VanNoy, Thomas’s attorney. VanNoy could not be reached for comment. An official in the Montgomery County coroner’s office confirmed that Thomas, who lived in Fairborn, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash on North Broadway street at 3.06pm and that Bailey, 30, died at the emergency room about 22 minutes later. Police told ABC22 that the car was travelling at between 90 and 100mph. Surveillance footage released after Crawford’s death showed he was shot after walking around the store with the pellet gun and occasionally swinging it at his side. The shooting was investigated by state officials and handled by a special prosecutor. A grand jury decided in September that the two police officers involved should not face criminal charges. Crawford’s family last month filed a civil lawsuit over Crawford’s death against the officers, the Beavercreek police department and its chief, and Walmart. All deny wrongdoing."
2015-01-02T17:11:07Z,us-news,US news,"'Excelsior, Governor Cuomo': politicians and journalists applaud a liberal giant","On New Year’s Day, 32 years after he was first sworn in as governor of New York, and the same day his son Andrew took the oath of office for the second time, Mario Cuomo died at the age of 82. Cuomo led New York from 1983 to 1994. His profile extended far beyond the Empire State, thanks in part to a famous speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention and his own dramatic deliberations over whether to run for the White House. He never did run for president – pundits have been asking “what if” ever since – but on Thursday commanders in chief paid tribute, along with senators, governors and writers. President Barack Obama “Michelle and I were saddened to learn of the passing of former New York governor Mario Cuomo. An Italian Catholic kid from Queens, born to immigrant parents, Mario paired his faith in God and faith in America to live a life of public service – and we are all better for it. He rose to be chief executive of the state he loved, a determined champion of progressive values and an unflinching voice for tolerance, inclusiveness, fairness, dignity, and opportunity. His own story taught him that as Americans, we are bound together as one people, and our country’s success rests on the success of all of us, not just a fortunate few. Michelle and I extend our deepest condolences to Mario’s wife, Matilda; his children, Governor Andrew Cuomo, Maria, Margaret, Madeline, and Chris; and his family, friends and New Yorkers who loved him dearly.” Bill and Hillary Clinton The former president and the former first lady, New York senator and secretary of state – and presumed frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 – released a joint statement: “We are terribly saddened by the passing of our friend Mario Cuomo. Mario’s life was the very embodiment of the American dream. When he placed my name in nomination at the 1992 Democratic Convention, he said government had ‘the solemn obligation to create opportunity for all our people’. In his three terms as Governor of New York, he honored that obligation. It was Mario Cuomo’s great gift and our good fortune that he was both a sterling orator and a passionate public servant. His life was a blessing.” Bill de Blasio The mayor of New York City ordered all flags be lowered to half-mast for 30 days and said Cuomo “established the gold standard in New York state for how public servants should act, and set an example that the rest of us continue to aspire to today. He was a man who campaigned with poetry and governed with beautiful prose … As he would often remind us, the state’s motto was ‘Excelsior’ or ‘Ever Upward’. Mario Cuomo personified the idea of New York, always urging us to look ‘ever upward’. Excelsior, Governor Cuomo. We will never forget his legacy.” George Pataki The former New York governor, who defeated Cuomo in his bid for a fourth term, said:
New York senator Chuck Schumer “From the hardscrabble streets of Queens, Mario Cuomo rose to the very pinnacle of political power in New York because he believed in his bones in the greatness of this state, the greatness of America and the unique potential of every individual. From soaring oratory that stirred the very soul to painstaking coalition-building to advance policies and accomplishments, he was a colossal political mind and represented the very best of public service; he leaves an indelible legacy on the state he loved.” New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand
Former US senator Al D’Amato
Reverend Al Sharpton The New York-based civil rights campaigner said: “We debated often, but he never would reduce our disagreements to petty personal grudges. He was a philosopher at heart that always saw the bigger picture. Even when we would engage in debate, I felt he was playing chess while I was playing checkers.” The press As Cuomo’s former speechwriter and advisor Stephen Schlesinger noted in the New York Observer, the former governor “charmed a coterie of New York journalists … they understood that he was at one with them in their politics and that he echoed their sympathies toward life’s struggles”. On Thursday night, reporters who followed Cuomo’s career – some for decades – paid poignant tribute. In his obituary of Cuomo for the New York Times, Adam Nagourney wrote: “When invited to sum up his own life for this obituary, he characteristically turned to self-deprecating humor. ‘People asked me what I want as an epitaph,’ Mr Cuomo said. He then reprised a line he had used many years earlier traveling across upstate New York, a fresh public figure displaying astonishing talent and obvious potential. ‘He tried,’ Mr Cuomo said.” In the Daily Beast, Eleanor Clift wrote: “Mario Cuomo knew where he came from, and he never spoke down to the American people.” In Capital New York, Terry Galway put Cuomo’s legacy in perspective: “Long before Bill de Blasio summoned the ghost of Charles Dickens, long before the phrase ‘income inequality’ became part of the political lexicon, long before shimmering castles rose in the Midtown sky in celebration of a new gilded age, there was Mario Matthew Cuomo, son of immigrants, child of the New Deal, keeper of his party’s conscience.” Finally, the New Yorker’s Ken Auletta looked back on his relationship with the governor. “In the four decades I knew him,” Auletta wrote, “I tried to keep him at arm’s length. Journalists are not supposed to say this, but I loved the guy.”"
2015-01-02T02:58:21Z,us-news,US news,"Mario Cuomo, three-term liberal governor of New York, dies aged 82","Mario Cuomo, the former governor of New York, has died aged 82. A statement from the governor’s office said he died at home of heart failure, with his family by his side. He had been unwell for some time. Cuomo, a renowned liberal and gifted orator, died on Thursday after his son, Andrew, was inaugurated for a second term as governor. His last public appearance was at an election-night celebration for his son in November. President Barack Obama led the tributes to Cuomo, who was born in Queens, New York to immigrant parents and whose popularity twice made him a possible contender for the White House during a long career in the frontline of politics. He was a “determined champion of progressive values, and an unflinching voice for tolerance, inclusiveness, fairness, dignity, and opportunity”, Obama said, whose life showed that the “country’s success rests on the success of all of us, not just a fortunate few”. Former president Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, said in a joint statement: “It was Mario Cuomo’s great gift and our good fortune that he was both a sterling orator and a passionate public servant. His life was a blessing.” “Mario’s life was the very embodiment of the American dream.” The mayor of New York city, Bill de Blasio, said in a statement: “Tonight, New York has lost a giant. Mario Cuomo was a man of unwavering principle who possessed a compassion for humankind without equal.” In his inauguration address on Thursday, Andrew Cuomo said he had read his speech to his father the night before. “He said it was good, especially for a second termer,” the younger Cuomo said.
Cuomo, a Democrat, was governor of New York between 1983 and 1994, losing to George Pataki in his attempt to be returned for a fourth term. He flirted with running for the White House in 1988 and 1992. For the perceived indecision which supposedly once left a plane idling on a runway before he finally decided not to travel to New Hampshire for the presidential primary, he earned the nickname “Hamlet on the Hudson”. A lawyer by training and profession, in 1993 he also came close to being nominated to the supreme court by President Bill Clinton.
It was his legal practice that first led him into politics in the mid-1960s when he helped residents fight a city plan to level small scrap-processing plants near the site of the 1964 World’s Fair. Cuomo won the fight and saved hundreds of jobs. For the next 10 years he repeatedly fought the power structure, winning concessions for residents in housing, education and welfare. When a law school friend, Hugh Carey, was elected governor in 1974, Cuomo joined his administration as secretary of state. In 1977 he returned to New York City to run for mayor.
He finished a close second but lost the run-off to Ed Koch, who blistered Cuomo’s opposition to the death penalty in what became a long-running Democratic rivalry. He then beat Koch in their run for the governorship in 1982 with heavy support from upstate New York. His speech to the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco confirming Walter Mondale as the nominee to take on President Ronald Reagan made his name on the national scene.
The speech, which articulated his liberal principles, took aim at Reagan’s economic policies, especially his comments that America was “shining city on a hill”. Cuomo countered by saying: “A shining city is perhaps all the president sees from the portico of the White House and the veranda of his ranch, where everyone seems to be doing well. “But there’s another city; there’s another part to the shining city; the part where some people can’t pay their mortgages, and most young people can’t afford one; where students can’t afford the education they need, and middle-class parents watch the dreams they hold for their children evaporate.” His speech defining Republicans as looking out only for the well-off and Democrats as champions of the middle class and the poor propelled Cuomo to the forefront of the party leadership. Cuomo easily won re-election for governor in 1986 and 1990. He repeatedly vetoed legislation that would have restored the death penalty in New York, and he closed down the Shoreham nuclear power plant on Long Island. He also built 30 new prisons. Under Cuomo, the state budget grew from $28bn to $62bn. In 2004, Cuomo authored Why Lincoln Matters, a book which sought to show how Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president and an icon of the Republican party, would have applied liberal solutions to contemporary challenges. He is survived by his wife, Matilda; Andrew; another son, the CNN journalist Chris Cuomo; and three daughters, Margaret, Maria and Madeline."

Dax was reportedly born weighing 3lbs; according to the Independent he is in the neonatal intensive care unit at Lenox Hill hospital in New York. The hospital did not immediately respond to a Guardian inquiry. “My mummy and daddy went on a five day break to New York as a last get away before I came along!” wrote Katie Amos and Lee Johnston from Lincolnshire, in the voice of their child Dax on a fundraising page entitled “Dax’s Tale of New York”. “They went to a cake shop (Mummy loves cakes), and were walking through Central Park on a movie tour and I decided they were having such a good time I wanted to see what all the fun was about, and I decided to pop out 11 weeks early!” The couple say they could be forced to stay in the hospital, uninsured and accruing medical debt, until 10 March. It is unclear whether the couple’s travel insurance will pay for the delivery of their son. The couple say on their fundraising page that they have no family or friends in New York. By Thursday evening, their fundraising page had raised $7,566 (£4,855). They have received significant publicity, including support from the British model Katie Price."
2015-01-01T22:16:49Z,us-news,US news,St Louis man arrested over alleged Twitter threats against police,"A man in St Louis has been charged with threatening to kill police and cause an explosion at the city jail in Twitter posts that referenced Ferguson, the nearby town where an officer’s fatal shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old led to protests and rioting. Jason Valentine is accused of 10 counts of making a terrorist threat, a felony punishable by up to seven years in prison in Missouri. The charges relate to 10 tweets that Valentine, 35, is alleged to have posted in December with the intention of “frightening 10 or more people”. Several referred to New Year’s Eve as “kill a pig night”, according to a probable cause statement released on Thursday by the St Louis circuit attorney, which claimed Valentine “used the slang ‘pig’ … to describe police officers” and was threatening to kill them.
One tweet allegedly said: “St Louis City Justice Center Mysteriously Exploded 12/31/2014”. Prosecutors charge that was a threat to cause an explosion at the building. Their statement said police “considered these threats to be serious in nature” and claimed that “kill a pig night” had “gained momentum nationally”. Another tweet allegedly used the hashtag “#KillJeffRoorda”. Roorda, the business manager of the St Louis Police Officers Association, is a prominent supporter of Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer who shot dead Michael Brown after an altercation on 9 August. Brown’s death was followed by several nights of protests that met a heavy response from police and reopened a national debate about policing and race relations. The town was hit by looting and arson after a grand jury declined in November to charge Wilson with a crime. Nine of the 10 tweets allegedly posted by Valentine featured a “Ferguson” hashtag; all referenced Vonderrit Myers, a black 18-year-old who was shot dead after allegedly shooting at an off-duty St Louis police officer in the Shaw neighbourhood in October, prompting further protests. According to the probable cause statement, Valentine “admits to using the Twitter user handle @jdstl314 and being the sole poster under that user handle”. The account has since been suspended and cannot be viewed. Police said Twitter suspended it on 29 December. Valentine was listed as living at an address in the Shaw neighbourhood. According to the probable cause statement he has a previous conviction for aggravated stalking and violation of a protection order. The charges are due to be presented to a grand jury for consideration."
2015-01-01T21:02:23Z,us-news,US news,Duluth case shows police body camera footage is new legal battleground,"When a man in Duluth, Minnesota, barricaded himself in a garage at his home and threatened to kill himself with a knife, police officers shot him twice. The incident, which happened in August, was captured on police body cameras. Months later, city officials who want the body camera video kept secret are in a battle with advocates of police accountability that many believe will be fought out in the Minnesota legislature. The man who was shot by police, 34-year-old Joe Zontelli, survived. The two officers involved were cleared of wrongdoing. But the incident made news in the midwest city of 86,000, and after an investigation was completed by the St Louis County attorney Mark S Rubin, reporters expected the video to be released. It was not. “The state crime lab kind of takes over the investigation and we just kind of waited out the results,” said Tom Olsen, a reporter for the Duluth News Tribune who filed a public records request for the police body camera videos. He said that under normal circumstances, reporters would have received their information requests after an investigation was complete and a press conference held. The county prosecutor reviewed body camera footage, but authorities didn’t release the videos. Gunnar Johnson, the Duluth city attorney, instead used a legal maneuver to try to temporarily classify the video – and future videos from other cases Duluth requested the state clarify what body camera footage is public and what should be kept private, through an unusual request to Minnesota’s information policy analysis division. The office denied Duluth’s request, in what will be the final word on the issue unless the legislature picks it up this spring. Johnson said his office was now “working” with the decision, “with the support of other municipalities”. “It’s a difference between a piece of paper and a videotape,” he said. “[Body camera footage] can span for, you know, an hour, two hours, there can be multiple cameras and, administratively, it’s a whole different world.” The city requested that blanket secrecy be applied to body camera footage taken in schools, hospitals and “private places”. The city also wanted footage from mental health crises, suspected juvenile crimes, and response to domestic and sexual assault to be classified as private. Summaries of many of the same law enforcement activities are publicly available through police reports. Privacy experts and law enforcement alike issued warnings about situations like that in Duluth. Transparency programs are politically popular, but in practice, many governments seek veto power over what is public. Given that Duluth police officers entered Zontelli’s home, followed him to the garage and saw blood beneath the barricaded door while he threatened his own life, it is understandable that releasing body camera video of the incident might be seen as invasive. Typically, a home is considered a private place and health issues a private matter. But when officers broke down the door, saw Zontelli had a knife, shot him twice and then claimed they had feared for their lives, some say the line between public and private vanished. Advocates say any officer-involved shooting is a matter of public interest. “One of the reasons for the body cam is to have the availability to see if law enforcement is doing their job,” said Rich Neumeister, a long-time privacy and freedom of information activist in Minnesota. “When I look at it in balancing the public interest weighs out, because this is where [residents] are shot by officers. There’s no ifs, ands or buts. It’s fact.” City police disagree. “I’m a huge proponent of cameras,” the Duluth police chief, Gordon Ramsay, told the Duluth News Tribune. “But we need to figure out how to balance the need for transparency while respecting the privacy expectations of our citizenry.” In June, Duluth became the first major police department in Minnesota to roll out body-worn cameras. But as the cameras are pushed by politicians – in the aftermath of this year’s civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, President Barack Obama proposed $263m in federal funding to put 50,000 more cameras on the streets – Duluth is unlikely to be the only department facing policy questions. Leading privacy and anti-surveillance advocates at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) are cautiously optimistic about the deployment of body cameras, but cite the lack of policy on the subject as worrisome. The organization recently asked 30 leading departments for their body-worn camera policies. “A large percentage of them simply don’t have them,” said Chris Rickerd, policy counsel for the ACLU. “The idea of rushing out something that is so important for accountability if the right policies are in place without these complicated, thorny issues thought through … is really irresponsible.” Olsen provided a copy of Duluth’s body camera policy, after Johnson told the Guardian a public records request would need to be filed to obtain a copy, a process that typically takes weeks. The policy requires officers to turn the cameras on during “crimes in progress” and “use of force”. But the policy does not answer more detailed questions about privacy, such as whether to record when interviewing children or whether residents can opt out of recording. “That’s a good question,” Johnson said. The state’s response to Duluth’s request was cut and dried – public records law is there, follow it. But the agency’s director said she understood that following the law was not. “Duluth didn’t have to request this temporary classification,” said Stacie Christensen, director of the Minnesota information policy analysis division, which handled the request. “I think the city attorney was speaking to the new technology and just the fact that the law hasn’t kept up with technological advances.” “We certainly understand the difficulties in trying to redact a videotape, that’s something that will never be easy,” said Christensen. “When you actually have to deal with a request, and deal with what is public and what is not public, that is certainly where it gets complicated.” However unnerving the situation is for officials in Duluth, it may soon come to a head. Olsen said he senses the city may be “preparing right now to release that particular video”."
2015-01-01T21:00:58Z,us-news,US news,Undocumented migrants in California begin road to getting driver's licenses,"California is about to start issuing driver’s licenses to undocumented migrants, a major step in the campaign to legalise the status of more than a million people in the state. The California Department of Motor Vehicles has ramped up staffing levels in anticipation of a wave of applicants when the new law takes effect on Friday. Tens of thousands of people have made appointments to apply for a license and about 1.4 million are expected to apply over the next three years. Proponents said the law, known as AB60, will take people out of the shadows and make roads safer. It will make a huge difference to daily life, said the Spanish-language newspaper La Opinion. “Without doubt it’s the immigrant community’s most anticipated law of 2015.” Eduardo Garcia, a Democratic assemblyman who represents Coachella valley, told the Desert Sun the move was a “major victory” for immigrants. “It’s exciting, certainly historic and a great thing for California,” he said. “Having properly trained, tested, licensed and insured drivers on our roads is not only important, it’s a priority.” Vehicle insurers said the law opened a new market. California has an estimated 2.5 million undocumented migrants, many of whom need to drive in order to live and work in sprawling cities with meagre public transport. Nine other states, including Nevada, Colorado and Illinois, grant licenses to undocumented people. Demand in California is expected to outstrip all the other states combined. California’s DMV has budgeted $141m for 900 extra staff, four new offices, extended opening hours and and training to avoid the bottlenecks, high failure rates and other snafus which impeded applicants in other states. “DMV is committed to successfully implementing this new law to increase safety on California roads by putting licensed drivers behind the steering wheel,” said DMV director Jean Shiomoto. “Californians planning to apply for a new driver license under AB60 should study for their exams and gather the required documents for proving identity and residency.” The license includes a distinct marking from those issued to US citizens and legal residents. A 2013 report by the California DMV found that unlicensed drivers were three times more likely to cause an accident than those with licenses. They were also more likely to flee the scene because being caught driving without a license can trigger deportation. Decades ago, undocumented people were able to obtain a driving license because applicants did not have to prove legal immigration status. A 1993 law, passed amid anti-illegal immigration sentiment, changed that by obliging first-time applicants to provide a social security number. With California public sentiment now swinging the other way, campaigners lobbied lawmakers to back to AB60 last year. Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed it, saying undocumented people no longer lived in the shadows. “They are alive and well and respected in the state of California,” he said. Immigrant rights activists urged those who had previously obtained a driver’s license under a false name or with another person’s social security number to consult a lawyer before applying, lest their application should trigger a fraud investigation."
2015-01-01T19:11:25Z,us-news,US news,Southern California gets unusual snow day as thousands brave cold,"An extreme cold front has gripped southern California, causing fatal accidents, dusting palm trees with snow and disrupting preparations for the Rose Parade. The thermometer at Los Angeles International airport hit 36F (2C) on Thursday, beating the old record of 38F, set in 1972. Ice formed in nearby swimming pools. Freezing temperatures overnight dumped heavy snow on mountains and foothills around the LA basin, producing picture-postcard scenes in places but problems for citrus farmers and homeless people. Marching bands and people on the flower-covered floats which parade through Pasadena before the annual Rose Bowl football game – this year Florida State versus Oregon – braced for potentially the coldest parade on record. Rough seas driven by strong winds claimed the lives of two men off Santa Catalina island, where boats in Avalon harbour washed ashore. Timothy Mitchell, 39, a Harbor Patrol officer who attempted to secure the boats, was crushed between a vessel and rocks on Tuesday. Police recovered the body of another man who was named as Bruce Ryder, 53. The cold snap toppled trees in northern California, killing two people in the town of Paradise as well as a woman in Redding who was struck when a pine crashed through her home. Authorities in Sacramento, Elk Grove and other cities opened “warming centers” for people needing refuge from the cold. They offer shelter, blankets and snacks. Icy conditions in Riverside stranded dozens of motorists who found it too difficult to drive on the highway. The California Highway Patrol said up to 200 vehicles in Big Bear, a ski resort, were towed after getting stuck in snow. The National Weather Service issued a freeze warning starting at midnight on Wednesday and continuing until noon on Friday, when temperatures were expected to begin returning to normal. Citrus farmers said they would use water, heat and wind machines and take other protective measures to protect their crops. A three-year drought had left some without water. Thousands of people with scarves, jackets, blankets and flasks braved the cold to line Pasadena’s streets for the 126th Rose Parade, a five-and-a-half mile procession that marks California’s start to the new year. The weather service recorded temperatures of 36F and said Pasadena may break its 1952 record low of 32F (0C). As temperatures dropped on Tuesday a group of organisers known as Petal Pushers blew on carnations and other flowers to coax them to open in time for the parade. On Wednesday a freak wind weather officials termed a “cold dust devil” sliced through booths and hurled equipment, prompting people, including one in a cow costume, to scramble for cover. Four people were slightly injured. As the parade preparted to get under way on Thursday, some people lining the route danced and did exercises to stay warm. The Los Angeles Time quoted one bystander who found it over the top: “This is Boston on a warm day, wimps.”"
2015-01-01T18:12:31Z,us-news,US news,Jeb Bush sheds corporate commitments to help 2016 presidential run,"New Year resolutions often involve weight loss, but Jeb Bush, who has already shed an estimated 15lbs since starting his run for the White House, has instead opted to jettison some heavy financial baggage. As the clock struck midnight on Thursday, and with Mitt Romney’s failed 2012 campaign still ringing in many Republican ears, the former Florida governor’s team quietly announced that their candidate was resigning from a slew of corporate boards and private equity interests that could cast a shadow over his presidential bid in 2016. Technically, Jeb Bush – son of President George Bush Sr and younger brother of President George W Bush – is still only “exploring” whether to seek the Republican nomination. But severing his many business ties means forgoing millions of dollars in consultancy earnings and is likely to prove almost as indicative of his determination to follow in family footsteps as did his announcement of a fundraising committee last month. Disentangling the extensive business interests that Bush has built up since standing down as governor in 2007 has not been a simple exercise. His first major resignation – as an adviser to Barclays following its purchase of Lehman Brothers – was confirmed by the British bank three weeks ago, after questions were raised about whether it and other controversial relationships could prove his achilles heel. He is also still reviewing what to do about some directly owned business interests such as the consulting firm Jeb Bush & Associates, according to the Washington Post, which first reported the latest news. Various private equity investments in energy and aviation, made through a company called Britton Hill that is named after the highest point in Florida, were only disclosed last June. At the time, such investments were widely interpreted as a sign that Jeb might have decided to heed his mother Barbara’s advice that there had already been enough Bushes in the White House. But the Republican establishment is anxious for a well-known candidate to challenge more radical rivals such as senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, and the Bush name is seen as the most reliable rallying point for wealthy donors and the business community after the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, was tarnished by a political scandal in 2014. The purge of awkward legacies also indicates an appeal to conservative Republican voters in what is likely to be one of the most competitive primary races in years. Bush has relinquished his interests in Academic Partnerships, an education firm that serves of a reminder of his close involvement in school reforms that are loathed by many on the right. Other board resignations recently disclosed in regulatory filings include Rayonier, which invests in forest land, and Tenet Healthcare, which reportedly profited from Barack Obama’s controversial healthcare reforms. But Bush has so far been unapologetic about his support for what are seen by some in his party as Democratic causes, such as common education standards and immigration reform. He said on Wednesday that he would not be attending a conservative summit hosted by the Iowa congressman Steve King, which is traditionally seen as a vital first step on the Republican primary race. He has also pledged greater transparency, including the publication of emails from his time as governor of Florida, although his spokeswoman did not respond to several calls and emails on Thursday about the corporate resignations and there was no mention of the decision on the Facebook page that his office used to announce his presidential plans. Aides told the Post that the New Year business purge was about “making time” to explore these presidential interests and “part and parcel of a process he is going through as he transitions to focus on a potential run for president”. The decision was a “natural next step”, said his spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, in separate confirmation to CNN, as Bush “turns his focus to gauging whether there is support for a potential candidacy”. Bush has insisted that his private equity interests are not on the same scale as Romney’s history with Bain Capital, which proved an attractive target for Democrats during his fight against Obama in 2012, due its alleged asset-stripping and firing policies. The other contenders Among the likely Republican candidates for the 2016 presidential race, Jeb Bush may be the most advanced in his declared interest, but his rivals are not far behind. “The more the merrier,” said the Kentucky senator Rand Paul when Bush first announced he was “exploring” a run in December, one of many indications that Paul’s participation in the contest is in as little doubt as that of his equally ambitious conservative colleague Ted Cruz. The Florida senator Marco Rubio also announced in a New Year’s Day radio interview that he was “spending the holidays thinking about his future”. The unusually early launch of team Bush was thought to be aimed partly at deterring other establishment competitors such as Rubio and the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, but their public prominence since and Mitt Romney’s strong performance in polling suggests it may have only spurred them on. And with governors from Indiana’s Mike Pence to Rick Perry of Texas and Scott Walker of Wisconsin dropping similar hints in recent days, the easier question among top Republicans is who isn’t running?"
2015-01-01T17:40:46Z,us-news,US news,"Forget Congress, these US states raised the minimum wage on their own","For some workers, there is more to celebrate this New Year’s Day than the end of 2014 . In 21 states and the District of Columbia, the new year brings with it a pay raise for those earning a minimum wage. In his State of the Union address last year, Barack Obama called on Congress to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been at $7.25 since July 2009, to $10.10. The following day, the president echoed that sentiment while speaking at Costco: “Right now in Congress, there’s a bill that would lift the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour – $10.10 – $10.10, it’s easy.” Tired of waiting for Congress to move on the issue of minimum wage, a number of US states have taken matters into their own hands. Alaska Alaskans should see their minimum wage increased in 2015, but they have to wait for the election results of the 4 November ballot initiative to be certified. The first pay increase to $8.75 an hour from $7.75 will take place 90 days from the certification, which be probably at the end of February, says Ed Flanagan, chair of Alaskans for a Fair Minimum Wage.
Arizona Arizona passed the Raise the Minimum Wage for Working Arizonians act in 2006. The law gives the Industrial Commission of Arizona the authority to raise the minimum wage based on the cost of living measured by the consumer price index of all urban consumers (CPI-U). The 1.7% rise in the index between in the one year before August 2014 was applied to the state’s existing minimum wage of $7.90 per hour. The new rate is $8.05 per hour. Arkansas Arkansas is one of the US states where minimum wage was lower than the federally mandated $7.25. That is, until 1 January. Thanks to a minimum wage ballot initiative, Arkansas low-wage workers will see their pay go up to $7.50 from $6.25 The minimum wage is then set to increase again in 2016 to $8 and in 2017 to $8.50. Colorado Colorado’s minimum wage saw an automatic hike on Thursday to $8.23 and $5.21 per hour for tipped employees. The adjustment is dictated by Article XVIII, Section 15, of the Colorado Constitution, which requires the Colorado minimum wage to be adjusted annually for inflation, on the lines of the Consumer Price Index for Colorado. The new rates replace 2014’s general rate of $8.00 and $4.98 for tipped employees. Connecticut At $8.70 an hour, Connecticut’s minimum wage was already higher than the federal minimum wage of $7.25. The state, however, passed a law to gradually increase it to $10.10 in the next three years. Connecticut was the first state to gradually raise its minimum wage to $10.10. On Thursday the state’s minimum wage increased to $9.15. Florida Florida’s minimum wage will rise to $8.05 on Friday, up from $7.93, following a 2004 amendment to labor laws that will adjust the minimum wage to match inflation. This increase will benefit an estimated 416,000 low-wage workers according to the Economic Policy Institute.
Hawaii Hawaii, where President Obama celebrated the New Year, is also one of the states leading the way on higher minimum wage. While this year its minimum wage is only going up 50 cents to $7.75, in the next two years it will go up 75 cents each year reaching $9.25 by 2017. In 2018, it will jump to $10.10. Along with Connecticut, Hawaii was one of the first states to gradually increase its minimum wage to $10.10. Maryland Connecticut might have been the first, but it was not that only state to work toward $10.10. In May, Maryland’s governor Martin O’Malley signed a legislation that increases the state’s minimum wage to $10.10 by 2018. On 1 January it increased to $8 from $7.25. It will then go up another quarter in July – reaching $8.25. Massachusetts Low-wage workers in Massachusetts will see their pay go up to $9 a hour. That’s a $1 boost. That’s not all. Forget $10.10. Thanks to a bill approved by the state’s legislature and signed into a law by Governor Deval Patrick, the state will have a minimum wage of $11 an hour come January 2017. Missouri A July reading of the Midwest Consumer Price will take Missouri’s minimum wage up to $7.65 from $7.50. All businesses are required to pay at minimum the $7.65 per hour rate, except retail and service businesses whose annual gross sales are less than $500,000, according to a release from the Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations. Montana Montana Department of Labor and Industry has announced that the state’s minimum wage will increase from $7.90 to $8.05 in accordance with the Montana Code Annotated 39-3-409. The consumer price index has been used as a reference to measure the increase in cost of living to calculate the hike in wages. “An estimated 12,850 Montana workers, or 2.9% of the workforce, received hourly wages less than $8.05 per hour in 2014,” according to a department news release. Nebraska The federally mandated minimum wage of $7.25 is not enough for the low-wage workers of Nebraska, says Jeremy Nordquist, a state senator from Omaha, Nebraska. To help them make ends meet, Nordquist started a campaign to raise the state’s minimum wage and on 4 November, Nebraska’s voters joined him in asking for a raise. As a result, the state’s minimum wage in 2015 will go up to $8. Then in 2016, it will go up to $9 an hour. New Jersey New Jersey too will automatically raise its minimum wage this year. Article 1, Paragraph 23, of the New Jersey Constitution, and N.J.A.C. 12:56-3.1(b) raises the minimum wage from $8.25 to $8.38, according to a memo from New Jersey’s Department of Labor and Workforce Development. New York New Yorkers, who were already being paid a minimum wage of $8 an hour, will also see a bump in their paycheck. Their new rate? $8.75. The pay hike was effective 31 December. A law passed in 2013 by the state’s legislature guarantees that next New Year’s Eve they’ll get another raise, worth all of 25 cents. Ohio In the new year, Ohio’s minimum wage will rise to $8.10 for non-tipped employees while those workers who receive at least $30 a month in tips will need to be compensated at $4.05 per hour, plus tips. The Ohio Department of Commerce has issued this directive following a 2006 amendment to the constitution, which according to Policy Matters Ohio, will affect one in 20 workers in the state. Oregon Effective 1 January, Oregon employers will pay 15 cents more in hourly wages as the state has raised the minimum wage to $9.25. As in several other states, this change too is aligned with changes in the consumer price index. The hike will impact about 145,000 workers in the state, or roughly 8% of its total workforce, according to the Oregon Department of Labor and Industries. Rhode Island Just like their counterparts in Massachusetts, Rhode Island residents’ minimum wage increased to $9 an hour from $8 an hour. This is the largest of three consecutive wage hikes approved by the state’s assembly. In 2013, Rhode Island’s minimum wage went up 35 cents and this year it went up 25 cents. The only downside? If you are a full-time student younger than 19, you only have to be paid 90% of the state’s minimum wage: $8.10 an hour. Those 14 and 15 years old get even smaller wage - 75% of the state’s minimum wage. At $6.75, that’s 50 cents less than the federal minimum wage.
South Dakota Despite the business community’s opposition to the South Dakota’s minimum-wage ballot initiative, the state’s hourly minimum wage increases to $8.50. In the years after, the minimum wage will be adjusted if there is an increase in the cost of living. “In no case may the minimum wage be decreased,” insists the South Dakota Department of Labor. Vermont At $8.73 an hour, Vermont, too, is among the ranks of states that already have a wage that is higher than the federal minimum wage. The gap between the two wages got even bigger Thursday as Vermont’s minimum wage went up to $9.15 an hour. Planning for the years to come, in June Governor Peter Shumlin signed a law that gradually increases the state’s minimum wage to $10.50 an hour by 2018. In the years after 2018, the state’s minimum wage will be adjusted based on the increases in the cost of living. Washington On 1 January, Washington’s minimum wage increased to $9.47 per hour. According to the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries, workers who are 14 or 15 years old may be paid 85% of the adult minimum wage, or $8.05 per hour. The change matches a 1.59% increase in the federal Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers over the 12 months leading to 31 August. This change is estimated to impact 67,000 workers and totals to an approximate increase of $312 in wages over a year, per employee. West Virginia West Virginia’s minimum wage hike would have passed unanimously through both its state House and Senate had it not been for one State Senator - Republican senator Clark Barnes. Despite his nay vote, the state’s minimum wage went up New Year’s Day to $8 an hour. In 2016, it will go up again to $8.75. Washington DC The District of Columbia’s minimum wage will rise to $10.50 on 1 July 2015. This is the second of three raises as part of the capital’s staggered increase from the 2013 minimum wage of $8.50. On 1 July 2016, the minimum wage will be raised further to $11.50 an hour. The three-step increase was initiated after mayor Vincent C Gray signed the Minimum Wage Amendment Act of 2013 into law on 15 January 2014."
2015-01-01T15:45:55Z,us-news,US news,Idaho Walmart shooting is latest example of fatal combination of children and guns,"On 5 April, a two-year-old accidentally squeezed the trigger of a cocked and loaded .357-caliber revolver, which had been stashed under his mother’s bed for temporary safekeeping. It fired, and the bullet struck his 11-year-old sister in the chest, killing her. The week around Halloween was marked by three toddler-involved shootings, which injured two children and an adult. On 30 December, an Idaho woman was accidentally shot dead by her two-year-old son while shopping at a local Walmart. Such cases involving young children and firearms are shocking but not altogether uncommon in the US. Each year, dozens of children are killed in unintentional shootings; others pull the trigger, accidentally injuring and killing parents, siblings and friends. “These are preventable deaths,” said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. “They’re tragic and horrible, but ultimately preventable. “This tragedy in Idaho needs to be the start of a serious national conversation about children and firearms. Because carrying a loaded gun in your purse while shopping with your two-year-old is a recipe for disaster. And in this case, the worst-case scenario played itself out.” There are no definitive statistics on how many people are accidentally injured or killed by children and toddlers who get their hands on guns. According to federal data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an average of 62 children aged 14 and under died each year in unintentional shootings between 2007 and 2011. But there is a caveat, explains Bob Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch with the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. Anderson said it was not uncommon to classify unintentional firearm deaths in which one person shoots another as a homicide, even if police reports indicate the shooting was an accident. “What this means is that we underestimate accidental firearm deaths,” he said, adding: “We don’t really have a good assessment of the extent to which we underestimate these.” There are studies that support the undercount, though they differ on the degree to which the figures are unreported. A 2013 New York Times investigation found that accidental shootings occurred roughly twice as often as the records indicate. Organizations like Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America advocate for stronger laws to punish adults if they fail to store a gun safely and a child is able to access it. Just under 30 states and the District of Columbia have laws that hold gun owners criminally liable if children get hold of their guns, though nearly half of those states require proof that the owner intentionally, knowingly or recklessly gave the child a gun, according to a report by Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. The National Rifle Association has long opposed safe-storage laws, arguing that such measures address an inconsequential problem. The NRA’s position, as stated on its website, is that education and training are paramount for preventing firearm-involved deaths. There is also a push for Congress to fund research on “smart gun” technology – a concept of equipping firearms with fingertip recognition or RFID chips, for example – that proponents say make handguns safer. Proponents of such “smart guns” have said the NRA is the main obstacle to their development. “As the leading firearm safety organization in the world we are heartbroken when tragic accidents occur,” Jennifer Baker, the NRA’s director of public affairs, told the Guardian. “No other organization does more to teach safe and responsible use of firearms than the NRA. “The NRA teaches people how to prevent tragic accidents from happening and has been successful in saving lives, while, the anti-gun groups like those funded by billionaire [former New York mayor] Michael Bloomberg exploit tragedy to push legislation that infringes on law-abiding citizens’ right to self-protection.”"
