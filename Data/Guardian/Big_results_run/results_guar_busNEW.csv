2021-03-03T19:54:21Z,business,Business,'Super deduction' may not be the most effective use of a Â£25bn tax break,"One can usually take a mental break when the budget speech turns to capital allowances. It’s the tinkering bit. This time was different. Rishi Sunak’s “super deduction” regime will allow businesses to offset 130% of investment spending on plant and machinery against profits for the next two years. So spend £10m on new equipment and reduce your taxable income by £13m, as the chancellor put it. It’s an eye-catching pitch to companies as they await the hike in corporation tax in 2023. The cost to the Treasury over the next two years will be £25bn, which is enormous. The Office for Budget Responsibility calculated it is 10 times more generous than the equivalent temporary capital allowance measures introduced after the 2009 financial crash. Will it work? With numbers of this size, it cannot fail to have some impact on business investment, a perennial weakness in the UK economy. Sunak cited the OBR’s forecast of a rise of 10%, or £20bn. And yes, one can see how boards of directors, perhaps hesitating over whether to upgrade a production line until they’ve seen the strength of the recovery, would be encouraged to take the plunge. As PricewaterhouseCoopers pointed out, there may also be “levelling up” benefits since manufacturers, one big beneficiary, are more concentrated outside London and the south-east. But there may also be a reason why such a blunt tool has not been used on this scale in the past. As well as encouraging fresh business spending, the Treasury may also find itself rewarding investment that would have happened anyway. Take BT, whose annual capital expenditure budget is about £4.5bn. Its share price shot up 7% after the budget speech, presumably on the thought of the juicy allowances that can now be claimed over two years for the roll-out of fast-fibre broadband. If BT responds by getting fibre to premises more quickly, that could be considered a benefit for the nation. But the gain may be marginal since the programme is well under way. Any acceleration may also be concentrated in cities, where it is easier to speed up, rather than rural areas. So yes, Sunak should succeed in getting a few cashed-up companies to invest more rapidly than they might otherwise have done. But is this the most effective use of a £25bn tax break? It feels unlikely. It’s time for a business rates review The big supermarkets may have expected to get something for their money when, after squirming in the spotlight for too many months, they handed back their relief from business rates last autumn. The prize for doing the honourable thing, or so they probably imagined, would be the launch of a fundamental review of the entire business rates system. It didn’t happen in the budget. Maybe the Treasury has decided a proper review is best conducted when it is easier to judge how much of the boom in online retailing will stick. But the review does need to take place – and soon. The current system is patently unfair on bricks-and-mortars retailers who pay rates on shops at values that are out of date by more than half a decade. Ken Murphy, the chief executive of Tesco, has previously made the point that many of the high streets affected most severely by the current rates system are those at the centre of the government’s “levelling up” plans. Exactly right. Another round of temporary Covid tweaks and reliefs on rates will be welcomed by smaller retailers. But the main event – a full review – cannot be delayed much longer.
Infrastructure bank needs solid foundations The chancellor was on weak ground in claiming to be launching “the first ever UK infrastructure bank”. We used to have something similar. It was the Green Investment Bank (GIB), created by George Osborne in 2012 and then sold to Macquarie of Australia in 2017. At least the previous experiment proved the concept works, even if Osborne himself never seemed entirely convinced. Public money was used to back green projects from windfarms to street lighting systems. Private capital followed in its wake. There was even a small profit for the Treasury on disposal. Let us hope the latest creation lasts longer than a single chancellor’s period in office. When they’re done well, these public-private partnerships can be very effective in getting infrastructure built."
2021-03-03T19:46:42Z,business,Business,Greensill crisis spreads as Bank of England and German regulator take action,"The crisis at the troubled lender Greensill Capital has spread after the Bank of England took action against one of the firm’s major business partners, and German regulators banned its local subsidiary from doing business and reportedly filed a criminal complaint against management. It is the latest blow to the supply chain finance firm, which counts David Cameron as an adviser. Greensill, which allows businesses to borrow money to pay their suppliers, is expected to file for administration in the UK within days. The uncertainty over the lender’s future poses a threat to a complex web of investors, business borrowers and nearly 50,000 jobs at firms that rely heavily on its loans, including across the UK steel industry. On Wednesday, the German financial watchdog BaFin confirmed it had ordered Greensill Bank – which holds approximately €4.5bn (£3.9bn) in assets – to freeze any payments as there was an imminent risk that the bank would become over-indebted. The moved followed a forensic audit in which BaFin raised concerns around bookkeeping, in particular on transactions linked to GFG Alliance Group, the steel empire headed by Sanjeev Gupta and employs thousands of people in the UK. In a statement, the regulator said: “BaFin found that Greensill Bank AG was unable to provide evidence of the existence of receivables in its balance sheet that it had purchased from the GFG Alliance Group. For this reason, BaFin has already taken extensive measures to secure the bank’s liquidity and to limit risks for Greensill Bank AG and has appointed a special representative for the bank.” Unions have raised concerns about the potential risk to thousands of British steel and engineering jobs linked to Gupta’s British steel operations as the Greensill crisis grows. The bank played a key role in financing Gupta’s sprawling business empire. Its prize asset is Liberty Steel, which employs about 5,000 in the UK, including at manufacturing plants in Rotherham, South Yorkshire and Newport. Further questions were raised about GFG Alliance Group’s finances on Wednesday when the Bank of England ordered its subsidiary, GFG Alliance, to inject about £75m into Wyelands Bank, a lender in which Gupta is a shareholder. Wyelands will use the money to return cash to retail savings customers as part of a plan it is agreeing with regulators. The bank had more than 15,000 savers in Britain and £726m in deposits, according to its 2019 annual report. Gupta said Wyelands had suffered “disruption caused by both Brexit and Covid-19”. BaFin has filed a criminal complaint against Greensill Bank’s management over suspected balance sheet manipulation, according to the Financial Times. The regulator, which declined to comment, began direct oversight of operations at the bank on Tuesday. Greensill said Greensill Bank took advice from its lawyers on how to account for assets on its books, but that it changed the classification of some assets after BaFin raised objections in late 2020 and early 2021. “For the avoidance of doubt, Greensill Bank has at all times been transparent with its regulators and auditors about its approach to classifying assets and the methodologies for determining such classifications,” it said. While the firm is registered in Bundaberg, the Australian home town of its founder, Lex Greensill, the majority of its business is based in London, where it employs roughly 1,000 staff.
Greensill was thrown into crisis earlier this week after it failed to secure a court injunction in Australia that would prevent insurers from pulling coverage for loans extended to its business borrowers. Its lawyers said the lapsed contracts would leave the firm unable to offer new loans to businesses, which may otherwise default and be forced to file for insolvency, putting 50,000 jobs around the world at risk. Credit Suisse later blocked investors from withdrawing money from $10bn (£7.2bn) of funds linked to Greensill. The Swiss asset manager GAM Holdings revealed it was also closing its $842m Greensill supply chain finance fund owing to “market developments and resulting media coverage”. Greensill is now holding out hope for a so-called pre-pack deal with the private equity group Apollo Global Management, which is expected to cherrypick the best assets out of administration. However, Apollo is not expected to pick up a tranche of loans extended to Gupta, whose GFG Alliance empire has relied heavily on Greensill loans."
2021-03-03T18:58:03Z,business,Business,Sainsbury's to cut 500 head office jobs with a further 650 at risk,"Sainsbury’s is to cut 500 head office jobs while another 650 jobs are at risk as the supermarket closes one of its online grocery packing centres. The UK’s second largest supermarket will also close offices in Coventry and Victoria in London and move out of two of the five remaining floors it occupies at its London head office in Holborn, another two floors at its Avebury office in Milton Keynes and one in Manchester as many staff permanently switch to working part-time from home. Sainsbury’s said that its remaining office space would be adapted to create “collaborative workspaces” which would encourage greater flexibility when they reopen. Supermarkets have been one of the main beneficiaries of consumer spending during the coronavirus pandemic, as locked-down shoppers spend extra money on groceries that they would usually have spent in pubs, restaurants and cafes. But the surge in online shopping, which is less profitable than selling via stores, and the need to provide protective kit and additional staff to cover for those off sick or shielding during the pandemic have all hit supermarket profits. From this month, supermarket sales are expected to begin falling compared with last year when sales surged as families prepared for the first lockdown. Sales are also likely to take a hit once pubs, cafes, restaurants, school canteens and workplaces start reopening. The majority of workers at the group’s “dark store” fulfilment centre in Bromley-by-Bow, London, which was the first to open in 2013, are expected to shift to working in Sainsbury’s stores. By March next year, more than 20 stores in and around the capital are expected to expand their online packing capabilities, enabling Sainsbury’s to deliver thousands more orders each week. The changes come after Asda announced plans to shut two of its online warehouses and reduce head office roles, putting about 5,000 jobs at risk. The supermarket is switching from its dark stores in Dartford, Kent, and Heston, west London, to picking grocery orders from the shelves of local stores. Sainsbury’s chief executive, Simon Roberts, said: “Our new plan puts food first and will create a simpler, nimbler and more efficient business. The money we save will enable us to invest in what customers really care about – lower prices, exciting new products and the most convenient ways for them to shop. “It is vital that we adapt. I understand this will be a very difficult time for affected colleagues and we will do everything we can to fully support them.” He said Sainsbury’s was now able to serve 850,000 online customers a week, having doubled capacity in the past year, and the shift to delivering from stores would help the supermarket adapt more quickly to changes in demand. The cuts are being made despite Sainsbury’s upgrading profit expectations by £60m in January after surging sales of champagne, steaks and other luxury food drove stronger than expected sales over Christmas and new year."
2021-03-03T18:52:16Z,business,Business,Greensill crisis leaves bank's founder facing sudden fall to earth,"Lex Greensill likes to tell his story. He boasts regularly about how he rose from a watermelon, sugar cane and sweet potato farmer in northern Queensland to become a billionaire banker traversing the world by private jet, and employing some of the world’s most powerful former politicians including the ex-UK prime minister David Cameron and the former Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop. He refuses, however, to talk about his current predicament, as Greensill Capital, the controversial bank he founded in 2011 with his brother Peter, a farmer, teeters on the brink of collapse. The mostly London-based bank – which he had last year hoped to float on the stock market with a $7bn (£5.8bn) valuation – is preparing to file for insolvency in the UK. Its remaining viable assets are expected to be picked out of the collapse by the US private equity firm Apollo Global Management for just $100m. Shareholders including the Greensill brothers and the Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, whose SoftBank investment fund had pumped $1.5bn into the business, will probably be wiped out. It is a sudden drop to earth for Greensill, who was lauded by Cameron for revolutionising the financing of small businesses and brought into the heart of government tasked with performing the same magic for the public finances. Greensill reportedly had an office in No 10 where he worked as a “crown representative” to the government on supply chain finance, and was awarded a CBE for services to the economy in the Queen’s 2017 birthday honours. The government’s “supply chain finance” initiative, devised by Greensill and promoted by Cameron, appeared to work at the time and was used by the NHS in its supply of thousands of chemists. However, an investigation by MPs into the collapse of the government outsourcing company Carillion found the scheme allowed it to “prop up its failing business model”, leading to an even greater toll of job losses. After leaving office, Cameron was signed up as a senior adviser to Greensill and flew around the world promoting the business. In December 2019, Cameron said: “From its UK foundations, Greensill has taken on the world, upending traditional financing models and democratising capital to give businesses, including many SMEs and small traders, access to low-cost funding.” Bishop also joined as an adviser. She said the bank offered “great potential to transform relationships throughout the world’s complex supply chains”. Greensill also claims to have advised the White House on supply chain finance. Greensill says his idea for supply chain financing – in which companies borrow money to pay bills while they wait to be paid by their customers (and his bank takes a cut) – came to him one day while working on the family farm in Bundaberg, north of Brisbane. “My parents couldn’t afford to send me to university because we had to wait a long time for big retailers to pay us,” he told the Sunday Times in an interview at his office overlooking the Savoy hotel in London. “That caused me early on to have a focus on how that could be fixed.” Before he set up Greensill, he worked in supply chain financing at global banks Morgan Stanley and Citibank, where he is remembered for his extravagance. In one incident he is said to have submitted an expense claim for new clothes for about £4,000 after being stranded in Copenhagen overnight due to a cancelled flight. Greensill says his bank’s driving mission is to help small businesses. His customers, however, include large companies: Vodafone, the retail group Very, owned by the billionaire Barclay brothers, and the “saviour of steel” Sanjeev Gupta, whose Liberty Group bought up struggling UK steel businesses. A spokesperson for the steel union Community said: “There’s no doubt these reports are concerning and, on behalf of our members, we are pressing the company for answers. Liberty Steel UK is a crucial strategic business and we are ready to work with the company and the government to secure the business and protect jobs.” Greensill is still regularly seen in Whitehall – transparency records show the company held six meetings with the second permanent secretary to the Treasury last year, before Greensill was accredited as a lender under the coronavirus large business interruption loan scheme. A Treasury spokesperson said: “Treasury officials regularly meet with a range of stakeholders to discuss our economic response to the Covid pandemic.”"
2021-03-03T16:30:22Z,business,Business,Australia's economy is recovering but remains very much in need of government stimulus | Greg Jericho,"The Australian economy in the last three months of 2020 grew quite strongly, but overall 2020 was the worst calendar year of the past 60 years. The 3.1% December quarter growth was almost as strong as occurred in September, but a closer look highlights that just because of a strong recent performance we should not discount the bad times. Amid any talk of the economy at the current moment, we must of course mention the pandemic.
A major reason for Australia’s relatively good economic performance compared to other nations is that we have been much less affected by the pandemic as those in Europe and the United States. There is a pretty solid correlation between economic performance in 2020 and the number of deaths from Covid:
Graph not displaying? Click here Certainly you would much rather be in Australia’s position than most other nations within the OECD. And Swedish residents must be wondering if their government’s approach to the virus was all that sensible given their initially more open strategy has resulted in negligible difference in economic growth but many more deaths. The December quarter in Australia saw the second strongest quarterly growth record over the past 45 years (the best happened in September last year). But even with a 3.1% growth in December, the last quarter of 2020 saw 1.1% less production than did the final quarter of 2019:
Graph not displaying? Click here That annual fall is much better than the 6.3% annual fall we saw in June last year, but focusing on the quarter to quarter growth does exclude the losses in production that have occurred. If we calculate the annual amount of production (which is how we generally refer to total GDP), 2020 saw a 2.5% fall in production compared to 2019 – the biggest calendar year fall recorded going back to 1959:
Graph not displaying? Click here Even more stunning was that GDP per capita in 2020 of $19,810 was 3.5% below what it was in 2019. By comparison the next worst calendar year fall was 2.5% in 1991 during the recession. 2020 was not just the worst year since 1960, it destroyed all records since then. Quarterly growth can suggest the ship has been righted with no passengers lost. Consider that if we just look at quarterly GDP (ie the amount produced in Australia in a three month period), the December quarter of GDP was just 3.5% below where you would have expected it to be given the trend of the previous decade. And even better, it looks like we’ll be back to trend levels later this year:
Graph not displaying? Click here That is exceptionally good, but it does rather allow us to forget the bad quarters – as though the lost production of three months is wiped away by the following three. In reality it is much harder to get back that lost work. When we instead look at annual GDP (ie the amount produced over 12 months), we find ourselves 4.5% below where we were expected to be given the past decade, and a long way from looking like we will be back on track:
Graph not displaying? Click here That’s not to say the quarterly recovery from the depths of last year are not good, just that we should not pretend the impact of the bad times is gone. And those suggesting inflation is about to come back due to this strong quarterly growth are clutching at some rather fantastical straws. So what produced the strong growth in the December quarter? We did. Our going out and shopping, buying clothes (up 16%), cars (up 32%) and being able to go to restaurants and cafes all led to a 4.3% jump in household spending in the December quarter. But even with that our spending at the end of last year was 2.7% below what it was at the end of 2019, and overall households spent 5.8% less in real terms throughout 2020 than we did in 2019:
Graph not displaying? Click here It’s worth noting that production in 2020 across seven industries fell more than 5% - with the accommodation and food services industry the hardest hit with yearly production in 2020 down 20% on what occurred in 2019:
Graph not displaying? Click here Other than consumption, the big drivers of growth came from exports (though this was cancelled out by the increase in imports) and also the increase in the purchases of machinery and equipment and dwelling construction off the back of the government’s stimulus measures.

Graph not displaying? Click here The drops in jobkeeper and jobseeker payments however did see a fall in real household disposable income. But despite this drop, households are better off overall than they were in the past decade when real incomes were flat – mostly due to the continual boost in social assistance and tax cuts.
Graph not displaying? Click here But just how badly is the economy really going? A nice and easy measure is to combine real GDP growth and inflation. The target for annual GDP growth is around 2.75% to 3.25%, while the Reserve Bank targets 2% to 3% inflation. This means the economy when all is going well the combination of the two should see the “nominal” economy growing at between 4.75% and 6.25%:
Graph not displaying? Click here In December it was 0.3% below where it was a year ago – a worse result than occurred during the 1990s recession. Yes, the December quarter figures are good, but nothing here suggests we are close to needing the Reserve Bank to start lifting interest rates or for the government to act as though things are back to normal. The Australian economy remains very much in need of government stimulus."
2021-03-03T14:40:46Z,business,Business,Ryanair boss says UK government support for aviation just 'PR stunt',"Michael O’Leary has described the UK government’s support for the airline industry during the pandemic as “lamentable”, as aviation leaders called for fresh help and warned of a long recovery ahead. The Ryanair chief executive said fares would be cut this summer to boost demand and that he hoped for up to 70% of normal passenger numbers from July. O’Leary said vaccines would enable travel, but added that regulations on border controls were “bonkers”. He described hotel quarantine as “completely unpoliceable”, saying the airline had seen no medical evidence to support it. “[It] has been a PR stunt, shambolic and ineffective and plays no role in keeping out the Covid virus,” O’Leary told MPs on the transport select committee on Wednesday. He said he was “not a great supporter in principle of a vaccine passport” because he feared delays in getting international agreement in time for summer, but said passengers should upload certificates saying they have had a vaccine or a PCR test in order to travel. Meanwhile, O’Leary said the Civil Aviation Authority had started “criminal proceedings” against Ryanair for carrying Italian and German passengers to the UK with valid predeparture PCR test certificates written in their own language, rather than the required English, French or Spanish. He said: “It’s this kind of bonkers, non-joined up regulation which is designed to make bureaucrats at the Department of Health look like they’ve done something. Whereas in reality it’s completely nonsensical.” O’Leary said it would be churlish not to recognise the government’s support for his employees via the furlough scheme, adding that the airline could not afford to top up pilot and crew pay towards normal levels. However, he criticised the government, saying ministers had been lamentable in providing other support. Questioned about a £600m UK loan to Ryanair, an Irish airline, O’Leary said: “We are by far and away one of the biggest investors in UK aviation, UK airports and UK jobs.” He said the money would be repaid in the next 12 months: “We’re very grateful but it is a loan, we are paying interest on it, and it will be repaid.,” he added. O’Leary said the impact of the pandemic had been devastating for the industry, with Ryanair seeing “a swing in the order of €2bn” (£1.7bn) in profit and loss in a year, and not expecting to break even before 2022. The best Ryanair could hope for was “60-70% of our normal traffic in the peak summer months”, he said, adding: “We will be dumping and lowering prices for the next six or 12 months to get people back flying again.” While O’Leary reiterated calls for reform of air passenger duty, airports called for more help with business rates. Full rates relief was offered to some sectors – which some large retail firms repaid – but airports have been limited to £8m. Karen Dee, the chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, told the committee that the rates relief would only cover losses for about 13 days for English airports, which had huge operational and security costs. “They are big costs that when you have no revenue and virtually no passengers, you simply cannot cover … that is not a sustainable position for any business,” she said. Tim Hawkins, the chief executive of MAG, England’s biggest airport operator, said data from the Office for National Statistics showed aviation had been hardest hit of all UK industries. It would take longer to recover and yet had received little aid, he said. “The sector specific support, the business rates, only gives half our liability at Manchester and Stansted and only came in November, since when we’ve been closed. It’s very hard to reconcile with the support given to other sectors.” He said the government’s global travel taskforce, which held a first meeting this week to prepare for possible overseas leisure trips from 17 May, was only “a plan for a plan”. The aviation minister Robert Courts defended the taskforce, saying that while the government hoped “to achieve certainty as soon” as it could, it was not possible to tell families or individuals what they should do for summer. “There is an element of assessing risk … people have to give themselves options and are clear about the implications of booking terms and insurance,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Welsh government announced it would pump more than £80m into struggling Cardiff airport to help it survive the pandemic. The airport, which is owned by the government, has been one of the worst affected, with traffic down 88%. The government will give a £42.6m grant and write off a further £42.6m it is owed. Wales’s transport and economy minister, Ken Skates, said that without help, the airport risked going bust and the state losing all its investment."
2021-03-03T13:35:52Z,business,Business,UK service sector optimism grows to highest level since 2006,"Optimism across the services sector improved for the fourth consecutive month in February to its highest level since 2006, reflecting hopes that the Covid-19 vaccine rollout will lead to a strong economic rebound. The IHS Markit survey found that business leaders were planning to expand their activities over the next 12 months despite several months of falling orders during the UK’s third lockdown and port delays after the Brexit trade deal was reached with the EU in December. International travel restrictions were the most commonly cited reason for lower exports along with increased paperwork at UK ports since January, which also stifled business activity by limiting essential imports, businesses said. Most firms looked beyond their current difficulties to focus on the prospect of looser restrictions on trade resulting from a successful vaccine rollout programme. The IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers index (PMI) covering the service sector stabilised at 49.5 in February, up sharply from an eight-month low of 39.5 in January. A figure of 50 separates contraction from expansion. Tim Moore, the economics director at IHS Markit, said: “While customer-facing businesses continued to report severe constraints on activity due to the pandemic, there were signs of growth in technology and some business services after a disappointing start to 2021. “Survey respondents cited regulatory issues and supply disruption as factors holding back new business wins from EU customers which more than offset the positive impact on overseas demand from the economic recovery in the US and Asia-Pacific.”
There was a warning from survey respondents about rising prices, which they said were passed on during February partly in response to Covid-related shortages of shipping on the main international routes and Brexit-related delays. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the outlook remained uncertain despite several forecasts that showed consumers who had accumulated high levels of savings were poised to spend them in the second half of the year. “Consumers are well-placed to play a key role given the recent high savings ratios, although much will depend on how much unemployment ultimately rises. After an extended period of weakness, business investment is expected to gain momentum over the course of the year as companies grow more confident in the economy.” Increased optimism also helped to stabilise employment, with only a small fall across services firms, which represent around three-quarters of the UK’s economic activity."
2021-03-03T13:05:31Z,business,Business,Housebuilder Persimmon's profits fall as Covid takes toll,"The housebuilder Persimmon has reported a lower annual profit because of the coronavirus pandemic, and said it was doubling its team of inspectors as it deals with the fallout from a public row over the quality of its homes. The company reported a pre-tax profit of £783.8m last year, down from £1.04bn the year before, when it became the only housebuilder to have made more than £1bn two years in a row. It said the Covid-19 pandemic cost it £17.1m, as building sites shut down for several weeks during the first national lockdown last spring. The number of homes completed fell by 14% to 13,575 in 2020 and Persimmon does not expect completions to return to 2019 levels until next year. However, the impact was mitigated by a near 7% rise in its average selling price to £230,534, while a private home now costs £250,897. Despite the pandemic, Persimmon has amassed cash of £1.2bn compared with £844m in 2019. The new year has started well, Persimmon said, with forward sales of £2.3bn, up 15% on last year. The housing market has boomed despite the economic downturn as many people have moved out of cities because of a surge in homeworking, and a stamp duty holiday introduced in July has also fuelled demand. The tax break was extended until 30 June in the budget and the chancellor also announced a new mortgage guarantee scheme aimed at first-time buyers who can only afford a 5% deposit. Persimmon’s share price rose almost 5%. Persimmon is increasing its team of build quality inspectors to more than 60 by the end of this year and said it would have the biggest such team in the industry. Its new chief executive, Dean Finch, said the team would report directly to the group construction director. Those inspectors “will assess every single plot we build at a number of key stages and only allow work to continue if our higher standards have been met”, he added. Finch, a former National Express boss, took over last year after Dave Jenkinson was ousted after the scandal over poorly built homes, only 15 months after he took the helm following a backlash against his predecessor Jeff Fairburn’s £75m bonus. Persimmon has overhauled its building process after a deluge of customer complaints and a damning independent review, which said the failure to meet minimum building standards was a “manifestation of poor culture” at the firm. The report, which was published in December 2019, also found a “systemic nationwide failure” to install fire-stopping cavity barriers in its timber-frame houses. Persimmon said it had conducted 35,000 inspections so far and fixed problems where necessary. Persimmon has also set aside £75m to remove flammable cladding at its apartment blocks. It has identified 26 buildings that used now-banned materials. Of those, it still owns five, all of which are less than six storeys high, and will oversee work to ensure fire safety. At the 21 other blocks, the company said it would give financial support to the new owners to make them safe. The rival firm Taylor Wimpey earmarked £125m for fire safety work this week.
Julie Palmer, a partner at the restructuring firm Begbies Traynor, said: “Despite restrictions, Persimmon has performed strongly during the pandemic, benefiting from the government’s help-to-buy scheme and the stamp duty holiday. “By deciding to delve into its own cash reserves, rather than government aid, Persimmon will be hoping to turn the tide on the lengthy battle to resurrect its reputation after becoming unfortunately synonymous with complaints about poor build and high executive bonuses.” She added that with the help-to-buy scheme changing from 1 April, when it will be restricted to first-time buyers only and limited by regional price caps, Persimmon would need to “monitor this situation closely”."
2021-03-03T13:01:00Z,business,Business,Rio Tinto chairman to stand down amid Juukan Gorge outcry,"Rio Tinto’s chairman will stand down amid an outcry over the miner’s destruction of a 46,000-year-old sacred indigenous site in Western Australia. Simon Thompson will leave Rio Tinto within the next year after accepting he was “ultimately accountable” for the company’s decision to blow up ancient rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. Rio Tinto blew up the rock shelters, which were highly significant to the area’s Aboriginal traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples, to help it access better-quality iron ore deposits. The decision led to an outcry from Indigenous Australian groups and investors, and a cull of senior executives at the Anglo-Australian company. The chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques, the head of corporate relations Simone Niven, and the iron ore boss Chris Salisbury resigned in September last year. Jacques was paid £7.2m for last year, a 20% rise, despite overseeing the disaster. Niven and Salisbury were given “termination benefits” worth US$1m and $1.3m respectively. Separately, the non-executive director Michael L’Estrange will retire after this year’s shareholder meeting. Rio Tinto said he needed to reduce his workload after “significant surgery”. L’Estrange wrote an internal review of the Juukan Gorge disaster, which was later criticised by the Australian senator Pat Dodson as an “unsatisfactory piece of work” that was “full of mea culpas and corporate lingo”. Last week, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) called on investors to “hold Thompson and other board members accountable” and insist on “necessary, constructive change to the company’s board composition”. James Fitzgerald, a strategy leader at ACCR, said on Tuesday there would be “no realistic prospect of Rio Tinto rebuilding relationships, trust and reputation while those responsible for the degradation of its culture and social performance remain on the board.” He added: “The departure of Rio Tinto’s chair, Simon Thompson, and director Michael L’Estrange suggests that the company understands this.” The National Native Title Council also welcomed Thompson’s resignation but said that if Rio Tinto was serious about cultural change then it would replace at least one of the outgoing executives or directors with at least one Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person. “They are in desperate need of First Nations voices in there and First Nations leadership,” said the council’s chief executive, Jamie Lowe. “And whether that be from an executive perspective or board level or other, that needs to happen … Because Rio Tinto is not going anywhere, they are a multinational company, they have got large footprints in Australia, so it’s critical we get those First Nations voices in there to make sure they are doing the right thing.” Lowe said that while the turnover in senior leadership was significant, he would wait to see if the company’s actions changed. “It’s no mean feat to get rid of your CEO, your chairman, other executives, other board members, all in the space of a six-month period,” he said. “They are signalling the right intent but the proof will be in the pudding, in the action that they deliver.”"
2021-03-03T12:54:12Z,business,Business,Morrisons likely to drop out of FTSE 100 as groceries boom wanes,"Morrisons is expected to drop out of the FTSE 100 for the first time in five years as analysts predict the groceries spending spree during the pandemic will wane. The quarterly reshuffle of the UK’s blue-chip stocks index is likely to result in the supermarket chain being relegated to the FTSE 250, along with the owner of South West Water, Pennon Group, while the newly listed footwear brand Dr Martens is expected to stride into the mid-cap 250 rankings. As well as the reputational sheen offered by FTSE 100 status, promotion or demotion can prompt significant turnover in shares as investors who follow indices are obliged to adjust their portfolios. Morrisons and Pennon are expected to be replaced by two engineering companies, Weir Group and Renishaw, according to analysis by Susannah Streeter of the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange, will confirm the results of the review after trading closes on Wednesday. These will be based on its calculations of the companies’ market values on Tuesday. Dr Martens will become one of the largest FTSE 250 members. The company – which is identified with a “DOCS” ticker since it listed in late January – was worth £4.82bn on Tuesday evening, according to the LSE publicly available data.
Russ Mould, the investment director of the investor platform AJ Bell, said Dr Martens’ success was “indicative of strong demand for new floats”. Dr Martens narrowly missed out on inclusion on the FTSE 100, after Renishaw’s share price surged on Tuesday when the engineering company in effect put itself up for sale. Weir Group, which was a member of the FTSE 100 until 2015, has gained ground in recent months thanks to booming metals prices that help its mining customers. For Morrisons a demotion, if confirmed, would come despite recent market share gains, as analysts predict retreating sales amid continued pandemic-related costs. Streeter said the supermarket chain had been seen by investors as an “underdog snapping at the heels of Tesco, J Sainsbury and Asda”, and could climb back quickly."
2021-03-03T12:43:24Z,business,Business,Daily Mail owner buys New Scientist magazine in £70m deal,"The publisher of the Daily Mail has acquired the renowned weekly science and technology magazine New Scientist in a £70m cash deal – the latest round of consolidation in the publishing sector. The 65-year-old title, which is owned by a group of investors led by Sir Bernard Gray, is based in London, with offices in the US and Australia. It is understood that Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT), which made an unsolicited approach to buy New Scientist and sealed the deal in just three weeks, has guaranteed the magazine’s editorial independence, ruling out staff cuts as well as the sharing of editorial content. “This was totally unplanned,” said Gray. “Three weeks ago I was planning the strategic future of New Scientist. “This morning I’ve been for a walk around the village, grabbed a coffee, fielded a few calls congratulating me on the deal, and now I’m unemployed.” The deal will mean a multimillion pound windfall for investors as well as a bumper pay day for a significant number of “directors and key management personnel”, from the magazine’s chief executive, Nina Wright, to its editor, Emily Wilson, who have shares as part of New Scientist’s business plan. New Scientist, which employs about 80 staff, half of whom are in editorial roles, is forecast to make £7m in profits and more than £20m in revenues this year. “New Scientist is a world-renowned publication loved by its readers, and we are both thrilled and proud to welcome it to the DMGT family,” said Lord Rothermere, the chairman of the Mail’s parent company. “We are very much looking forward to supporting their exciting plans to grow as the go-to publication for anyone interested in the scientific world around us.” Gray’s consortium, which operates the business under New Scientist Group Limited, acquired the magazine four years ago from Relx, formerly known as Reed Elsevier, which had owned it since 1970. Relx retained a small stake through a preferential share arrangement. That has also sold to DMGT as part of the deal. Financial filings name the directors as Gray, business partner Louise Rogers, Richard Lenane of the private equity firm Exponent, and Wright, who was made a director last February. The filings state that “directors and other key management personnel” have shares in the company. Founded in 1956 for “all those interested in scientific discovery and its social consequences”, New Scientist has a weekly global circulation of 134,000 for its print and digital editions. Just over half are UK-based, and three-quarters are subscribers to the magazine, which has average weekly sales of about 84,000 copies, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. The publisher has also expanded into events, with the New Scientist Live festival of science. “The acquisition of New Scientist marks an exciting new addition to the DMGT portfolio and reflects our disciplined approach to acquisitions,” said Paul Zwillenberg, the chief executive of DMGT, which also owns the Metro and i newspaper titles. “It is a natural step in our consumer strategy to improve the quality of our revenues through building up subscriptions and digital capabilities.” DMGT has been building its publishing portfolio with selected acquisitions in recent years, including the £49.6m deal to buy the i two years ago. Gray previously bought Tes, formerly the Times Educational Supplement, from Rupert Murdoch’s News International (now News UK) in 2005 in a £235m deal backed by Exponent.
In 2018 he was named executive chairman of Time Inc UK, owner of titles including Country Life and Woman’s Weekly, although he stepped down after six months. The sale of New Scientist is the latest in a string of magazine deals. Last month, the New European, an anti-Brexit magazine founded after the EU referendum in 2016, was acquired by a consortium of investors including the former New York Times chief executive and ex-BBC director general Mark Thompson. In December, JPI Media, the regional publisher that owns newspapers including the Scotsman and the Yorkshire Post, was acquired for only £10m."

2021-03-03T09:55:31Z,business,Business,Insurer Hiscox hit by loss after paying out for Covid-related claims,"The Lloyd’s of London insurer Hiscox has swung to a loss after paying out $475m for cancelled events, business interruption policies and other claims related to the coronavirus pandemic. Admitting it had suffered some “brand damage”, the company, which insures anything from oil rigs to paintings, classic cars and businesses, struck an apologetic tone after disputes last year with a number of firms over whether their business interruption cover should pay out for the pandemic. Such policies are a key part of commercial insurance cover that pay out if a firm cannot trade as usual owing to an unexpected event. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses that were forced to close during the pandemic won a “historic victory” in January when the UK’s supreme court threw out the appeals from six insurance companies and largely supported the arguments made by the Financial Conduct Authority in a test case and a policyholder action group. Firms could receive insurance payouts of more than £1bn collectively. Hiscox said it had begun paying claims, and hired more claims handlers to speed up the process, with about one in three of its 34,000 UK business interruption polices paying out. Bronek Masojada, the Hiscox chief executive, apologised for the episode. “We clearly regret the uncertainty and anguish that the dispute has caused to our customers, so it is important that we learn from this experience. The most important lesson is the need for clarity in wordings, to ensure intent is properly reflected in the policy detail. In addition, the customisation of policies has to be restricted to ensure that there is not a long tail of wordings serving very small numbers of customers.” Small businesses are likely to suffer more in the months ahead when government support measures run out, and have also been hit hard by Brexit, which has resulted in delays at the border, complicated paperwork and extra costs. The Covid-19 losses pushed Hiscox into a pre-tax loss of $268.5m (£192m) for 2020, compared with a profit of $53.1m the year before. Without the pandemic, it would have generated a profit of $207m, Hiscox said.
Most of the pandemic-related losses were for event cancellations, where Hiscox sold communicable disease cover, and most of those claims have been paid. The second-largest share for Covid-19 claims is from UK business interruption cover. Robert Childs, Hiscox’s chairman, said: “2020 got off to a good start and then came the global pandemic. Over my 48 years in the business, I have experienced most of the challenges that Mother Nature and mankind have thrown at the insurance industry but Covid-19 and its repercussions have been one of the most testing.” The Covid-19 crisis has also affected the way Hiscox works, and accelerated the digital shift of business processing, with more than 90% of its London market business done digitally last year."
2021-03-03T03:39:14Z,business,Business,Australia's economic recovery continues with 3.1% growth in December quarter,"The Australian economy grew by 3.1% in the December quarter as the domestic recovery from the pandemic-induced shock consolidated. The continued bounce back in growth late last year as coronavirus restrictions eased followed a 3.4% increase in GDP in the previous quarter. The September result followed a record 7% fall in GDP in June, triggered by the public health measures. While the solid December quarter result suggests the economy is on a recovery path, in annual terms, there has been a 1.1% fall in GDP. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that GDP per capita was also weaker, falling 1.8%, reflecting a 0.7% rise in population. The economic recovery, while exceeding market expectations and previous economic forecasts, was also partial.
Speaking to reporters in Canberra, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said this was “the first time in recorded history that Australia has seen two consecutive quarters of economic growth of more than 3%”. He said the December quarter figures indicated the economy had recovered 85% of its “Covid-induced fall, six months earlier and twice as fast as we expected in last year’s October budget”. “This is a very encouraging performance from the Australian economy, given the economic abyss that we were staring into at the peak of this crisis,” Frydenberg said. The positive result in the September quarter was driven by a 4.7% increase in the terms of trade, reflecting high export prices for iron ore. Final consumption expenditure also contributed 2.3% to the quarterly growth result. Spending by households rose 4.3% the September quarter, but it remained subdued in annual terms. Spending was down 2.7% in the year. The savings ratio hit record levels during the pandemic, but the data suggested consumers were cautiously returning to the fray. The household saving-to-income ratio declined to 12.0% from 18.7% in September. The ratio remained at elevated levels, and the quarterly result reflected two factors – a cautious return to consumption, and falls in gross disposable income as the Morrison government withdrew fiscal support, tapering the jobkeeper wage subsidy and the jobseeker payment. Victoria was part of the consumption story. As the state moved out of stage four lockdown, consumption by households increased by 10.4%, which replicated activity during the previous quarter for households outside Victoria. The Australian Bureau of Statistics noted spending on goods was up by more than 6% in annual terms, and 2.8% in the quarter.
Rather than heading overseas for holidays, Australians seemed to be buying vehicles, with spending up a record 31.8%. The ABS said this was the largest rise in the history of the national accounts. It said the expenditure reflected “elevated household disposable income and shifting spending patterns with continued limitations on some expenditure items such as international travel”. Private investment recorded its strongest result since the September quarter in 2017. Activity in the housing market was strong, and a rise in business investment during the December quarter was driven by an 8.9% increase in machinery and equipment, reflecting government tax incentives to stimulate the economy. The farm sector also enjoyed favourable conditions. An increase in agricultural production during the quarter flowed through to a 23.5% increase in rural exports. But the hospitality sector recorded unprecedented falls in activity because of the impact of the January bushfire crisis and the Covid-19 restrictions. Over the past 12 months, household consumption of hotels, cafes and restaurants fell by almost 30% and consumption of transport services was down 78.1%. Frydenberg said the latest data showed the government’s economic recovery plan was “working”, but he acknowledged the “job is not done”. “There are challenges ahead – but you wouldn’t want to be in any other country but Australia as we begin 2021”."
2021-03-03T02:24:56Z,business,Business,Rio Tinto investors welcome chair's decision to step down after Juukan Gorge scandal,"Investors and First Nations groups have welcomed the Rio Tinto chair Simon Thompson’s decision to leave the company after accepting he was “ultimately accountable” for the mining company’s decision to blow up ancient rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. Thompson will not stand for re-election to the board next year in a decision that follows the resignations in September of the chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques, the head of corporate relations Simone Niven and the iron ore boss Chris Salisbury. Separately, the non-executive director Michael L’Estrange will retire after this year’s shareholder meeting. Rio Tinto said he needed to reduce his workload after “significant surgery”.
L’Estrange wrote the internal review of the Juukan Gorge disaster, which was later criticised by Senator Pat Dodson as an “unsatisfactory piece of work” that was “full of mea culpas and corporate lingo”. The National Native Title Council welcomed Thompson’s resignation but said if Rio Tinto was serious about cultural change it would replace at least one of the outgoing executives or directors with at least one Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person. “They are in desperate need of First Nations voices in there and First Nations leadership,” NNTC chief executive Jamie Lowe said. “And whether that be from an executive perspective or board level or other, that needs to happen … Because Rio Tinto is not going anywhere, they are a multinational company, they have got a large footprints in Australia, so it’s critical we get those First Nations voices in there to make sure they are doing the right thing.” Lowe said that while the turnover in senior leadership was significant, he would wait to see if the company’s actions changed. “It’s no mean feat to get rid of your CEO, your chairman, other executives, other board members, all in the space of a six month period,” he said. “They are signalling the right intent but the proof will be in the pudding, in the action that they deliver.” Ian Silk, the chief executive of Australia’s biggest superannuation fund, AustralianSuper, said the resignations of Thompson and L’Estrange provided Rio with an opportunity to appoint more Australians to the board. He said it was “appropriate and timely” for Thompson to assist with the transition from Jaques to Jakob Stausholm, who was appointed CEO in December. “However, as Mr Thompson has said, he is ‘ultimately accountable’ for the failings that led to the Juukan Gorge incident, and as a result his resignation is an appropriate acknowledgement of that governance failure,” Silk said. Super fund Hesta, which campaigned heavily for change at Rio after Juukan Gorge, also welcomed the departures. “Investors need confidence Rio, throughout the organisation, will act in good faith with all stakeholders,” chief executive Debby Blakey said. “The decision today allows for a fresh perspective and a renewed board focus on repairing and building stronger links with Indigenous communities in the countries in which Rio operates. “Rigorous board oversight and governance will be crucial to achieving future progress in this regard.” The activist shareholder group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility welcomed Thompson and L’Estrange’s departures but said other directors including Sam Laidlaw should also consider their positions. Laidlaw, who chairs a remuneration committee that approved payouts for the departing executives, and another senior independent director, Simon McKeon, will lead Rio Tinto’s search for a permanent replacement for Thompson. “I am proud of Rio Tinto’s achievements in 2020, including our outstanding response to the Covid-19 pandemic, a second successive fatality-free year, significant progress with our climate change strategy, and strong shareholder returns,” Thompson said. “However, these successes were overshadowed by the destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters at the Brockman 4 operations in Australia and, as Chairman, I am ultimately accountable for the failings that led to this tragic event.” ACCR’s legal counsel, James Fitzgerald, said that there was “no realistic prospect of Rio Tinto rebuilding its relationships and its reputation while those responsible for the degradation of its culture remained on its board”. “The departure of Thompson and L’Estrange suggests that Rio Tinto is also well aware of this. “News of their departure is welcome but other directors like Sam Laidlaw need to reflect on whether their continuing as directors is the interests of the company and its shareholders.” Labor’s Indigenous affairs spokesperson, Linda Burney, said Thompson’s acknowledgement that the destruction of Juukan Gorge was “a source of personal sadness and deep regret” was “important”. “I sincerely hope this acknowledgement is a further step towards substantive cultural change – not only within Rio Tinto, but the mining sector as a whole – which sees companies work more closely and constructively with Traditional Owners to ensure incidents like this never happen again.” L’Estrange’s review found Rio received four separate reports detailing the significance of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples (PKKP) in the years between receiving government approval to destroy the site in 2013 and detonating the blast last May. They included: a 2013 ethnographic survey stating the site was “of high significance to Puutu Kunti Kurrama, in the old days and still today”; a 2014 draft report of an archeological survey, paid for by Rio, which detailed signs of continuous occupation over 46,000 years including a 4,000 year-old hair belt which DNA testing revealed showed a direct genetic link to PKKP living today; the 2018 final report of that archeological survey which said the site has “the amazing potential to radically change our understanding of the earliest human behaviour in Australia”; and an ethnographic survey in 2020 further outlining the significance of the site to the PKKP. At a Senate inquiry last year, Rio Tinto’s vice-president of corporate relations in Australia, Brad Haynes, said no one in the senior executive team had read any of those reports before May 2020 “because we were always operating on the basis that there was consent”. At the same hearing, Jacques said Rio had not told the PKKP that it had considered, and dismissed, options for expanding the mine that would have left the sacred sites intact.
The destruction of the site was outlined in a lengthy and complicated partnership agreement in 2011. Once permission to destroy the site was granted under WA’s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws, it was removed as an obstacle from Rio’s operational maps. Evidence presented to the Senate inquiry showed the PKKP repeatedly voiced their concerns directly to the company. The partnership agreement contained non-disparagement clauses that prevented the PKKP from publicly expressing their concerns about the site. Minutes from meetings held by Rio in the days before the site was destroyed show that the company hired lawyers for a potential injunction against the PKKP in the event the gag clause was breached. The PKKP issued a media release the day after the sites were destroyed. The PKKP and the Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, both declined to comment on Thompson’s resignation."
2021-03-03T01:18:59Z,business,Business,US to investigate claim of forced labour at Boohoo suppliers,"US authorities have launched an investigation into allegations of forced labour in Boohoo’s UK supply chain, which could lead to the online fashion seller’s goods being impounded at ports. The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) body is understood to have found sufficient grounds for the investigation late last month after Liberty Shared, a charity which campaigns against modern slavery, sent it a petition on 1 February outlining problems with Boohoo factories in Leicester. If the CBP finds evidence goods have been made with forced labour it can instruct ports not to release them. A second similar petition sent on 7 February outlined potential problems in clothing factories throughout the district of Leicester East, where Boohoo is thought to buy more than 60% of the goods made. The Boohoo petition refers to a number of studies into conditions in Leicester factories including an independent review carried out by Alison Levitt QC last year and a study by the Centre for Social Justice and Justice & Care published last year. The Boohoo-commissioned Levitt review found that allegations of poor working practices in the company’s supply chain were “substantially true”. The company has since appointed Sir Brian Leveson, the retired judge who led the phone-hacking inquiry, to oversee the overhaul of its supply chain. Hong Kong-based Liberty Shared argues that the supply chain in Leicester has “a high potential for forced labour”, partly because local police and government provision for prevention, protection and prosecution on forced labour issues is “currently inadequate and therefore the vulnerable are at high risk of being victimised”. Boohoo said it had not received any correspondence from and was not aware of any investigation by CBP, which has the power to ban imports into the US if it finds evidence of modern slavery. In a statement to the stock market, Manchester-based Boohoo said: “The group is confident in the actions it is taking to ensure that all of its products meet the CBP criteria on preventing the product of forced labour entering the US (or any of its markets). Boohoo continues to fulfil orders to customers in the US across all of its brands. The group will work with any competent authority to provide assurance that products from its supply chain meet the required standard.”
CBP said it could not comment on whether it was investigating any specific companies. However, the body does investigate allegations from a variety of sources, including private citizens, investigative journalists and campaigning groups. If it finds evidence “reasonably indicating” that forced labour has been used in producing goods it can issue a “withhold release order” instructing ports to detain shipments. Importers then have three months to either take back the goods or submit evidence demonstrating the merchandise was not made using forced labour. Last year the CBP issued 13 such orders, more than in the previous four years. Simon Bowler, an analyst at Numis, said: “Orders to prevent the import of product under these regulations look to be rare, and the nature of an investigation across a complicated supply chain that is in the process of being overhauled, for which no evidence of modern slavery has yet been found by current UK enforcement bodies, means that the direct risk arising from these letters feels remote.” However, he added that the US was an important market for Boohoo, accounting for a quarter of revenues, and concerns about a ban were “another element of risk for investors”. Shares in Boohoo, which recently bought the Debenhams brand to sit alongside its PrettyLittleThing, Nasty Gal, Warehouse, Karen Millen and Oasis labels, were down 4.5% on Tuesday afternoon."
2021-03-02T22:30:00Z,business,Business,Sunak to reform stock market to shore up City of London's position,"Rishi Sunak will pave the way for sweeping reforms of the stock market to attract more fast-growing companies to list in the UK, amid the growing risk to London’s status as a leading financial centre after Brexit. In a development to coincide with the budget on Wednesday, the chancellor will publish the findings of a landmark review into UK listings rules to boost Britain’s attractiveness as a place for firms to grow and be taken public. Led by the former EU financial services commissioner, Lord Jonathan Hill, the overhaul could introduce the most significant reforms in the City of London in decades. It comes amid concern at the heart of government that Britain risks losing out to international rivals such as Amsterdam, New York and Hong Kong when it comes to hosting stock market debuts for fast-growing technology firms, and as the chancellor and prime minister attempt to frame the country as a destination for global business after Brexit. Commissioned by the chancellor last year to further enhance the UK’s position as an international destination for share listings, the report proposes more than a dozen reforms that are designed to make it easier for innovative firms to list in the UK. At present the most significant companies listed in London are either financial or more representative of the old economy of mining, energy and natural resources. The US technology giant Apple was worth more at one point last summer than the combined value of every company in the FTSE 100. Amsterdam overtook London as Europe’s largest share trading centre earlier this year, and as experts say the symbolic blow could be followed by the City losing jobs as well as more business owing to Brexit. Lord Hill told the Guardian he believed the strength and depth of London’s financial service industry meant it would be difficult for competing European cities to topple its status as the continent’s leading hub for global finance. However, he said rule changes were still needed to maintain and increase competitiveness after Brexit. “The worst thing for London to do is to sit here waiting to see what happens and hoping that Europe will give us equivalence and everything will come out all right in the wash. “I’m not a Singapore-on-Thames man, but the opportunity to set rules and regulations more speedily, flexibly and proportionately in areas like sustainable finance and technology, I do think there is an opportunity there,” he said. The review calls for a shake-up of listings rules to allow dual class share structures on the London Stock Exchange’s premium segment, which would give directors and company founders enhanced voting rights. The changes would enable such listings to be eligible for inclusion in the blue-chip FTSE indices, which attract a wider pool of investors than the standard segment of the London exchange. Other measures include cutting the amount of shares a company must sell to the public from 25% to 15%. Steps are also recommended to liberalise rules regarding special purpose acquisition companies, known as Spacs, which are “blank cheque” shell companies launched to raise money from investors first and then hunt for a business to buy later. Such stock market listings have become one of the most prominent trends in global finance in the past year, with a host of Spacs floating in New York and London. The rule changes are intended to persuade firms such as Cazoo, the UK-based online car platform, to consider a London listing. The firm, which could be valued as high as £5bn when it goes public, has been reportedly eying a merger with a New-York listed Spac as an alternative. Faced with increasing competition from abroad, Hill also recommended that the chancellor produce an annual report to parliament each year on the competitive position of the City. However, the plan to reform the listings rules could prompt concern that Britain is downgrading standards of corporate governance in favour of chasing high-profile trophy listings – echoing the debate over the mooted $2tn listing of the petrol group Saudi Aramco.
Hill said he had recommended safeguards to maintain investor protections, while arguing that it made no sense to have a theoretically perfect listing regime if, in practice, users increasingly choose other venues. “The recommendations in this report are not about opening a gap between us and other global centres by proposing radical new departures to try to seize a competitive advantage. They are about closing a gap which has already opened up. All the recommendations are consistent with existing practices in other well-regulated financial centres in the USA, Asia and Europe,” he said. Sunak said the report had delivered bold ideas to help enhance the UK’s reputation after Brexit. “The review has more than delivered and I’m keen we move quickly to consult on its recommendations, cementing the UK’s reputation at the front of global financial services,” he said."
2021-03-02T22:30:00Z,business,Business,London stock market review does nothing for private retail investors,"“It makes no sense to have a theoretically perfect listing regime if in practice users increasingly choose other venues,” says Lord Hill in the introduction to his report on how to shake up London’s stock market listings regime. It’s a fair, pragmatic point. London accounted for only 5% of IPOs, or flotations, globally between 2015 and 2020, which is a feeble performance if the post-Brexit ambition for the stock market is to rival New York, and not just deflect Amsterdam’s challenge. A few of London’s supposedly sacred governance principles were always likely to be sacrificed. At least Hill has tried to soften the process. The least objectionable proposal is the green light for dual classes of shares. Such “golden share” structures are a governance no-no but the US, by accepting them, has dealt itself an ace card to lay in front of footloose founders of technology firms. Hill proposes a five-year limit on “golden share” structure. That is better, governance-wise, than open-ended US arrangements. Nor should a reduction in “free floats” – the minimum proportion of shares available to outsiders – from 25% to 15% cause too much fuss. Actual liquidity, rather than percentages, is more important. Hill’s embrace of Spacs, or “blank cheque” special purpose acquisition companies that are all the rage in the US, will rightly be more controversial. He could have taken a harder line against elaborate structures that seem designed to bypass traditional levels of scrutiny by investors. Hill recommended a Spac regime that would be stricter than Amsterdam’s. That’s not saying much. The real disappointment, though, was the lack of a big proposal to boost the role of private retail investors in stock markets – the cause championed here yesterday. There were warm words about the importance of individual investors, and a few ideas to make IPO prospectuses more user-friendly, but the Treasury has effectively been handed the job of conducting another review to remove obstacles in front of retail participation. Maybe it will happen; maybe it won’t. The rest of review, though, should be broadly acceptable. London needs to be in the game of attracting young and growing companies. For governance purists, it could have been worse. Engineering a tricky sale It’s end-of-an-era time in Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire, global base of Renishaw, one of the UK’s most quietly successful engineering companies. Sir David McMurtry and John Deer founded the maker of ultra-precise measuring devices and equipment in 1973 and now, having reached their 80s, they want to sell their stakes. Between them, they own 52% of Renishaw, a holding worth roughly £2.5bn, so the whole firm is on the block. As you would expect (or hope), McMurtry and Deer do not wish their life’s work to end up with a carve-up merchant. They are seeking innovation-led buyers that will “respect the unique heritage and culture of the business, its commitment to the local communities in which its operations are based”. One hopes the duo find what they are looking for, but the task does not look easy, however. At £5bn – in other words, within touching distance of the FTSE 100 index – Renishaw is not a small mouthful. It is hard to think of a British engineering company that is both big enough and would fit the bill. Rolls-Royce is valued at £9bn but is fighting fires on many fronts; in any case, while it is customer of Renishaw, this isn’t its market. A large overseas engineering combine therefore seems the most likely buyer. That could still be honourable way to go, of course; it would depend on the buyer’s commitments to the business. But it would also feel a slightly underwhelming finale. Furlough relief shouldn’t be budget spin Is there anything left to reveal in the budget? We’ll find out soon enough but the Treasury’s late news on Tuesday that the furlough scheme is being extended until September would normally have qualified as a “rabbit out of the hat” announcement. An extension of only two or three months from the current April cut-off had been expected. A longer timetable is sensible and will be welcomed, especially by small employers in sectors such as hospitality and events. But why couldn’t it have been made a month ago or six weeks ago, which was the point of greater uncertainty for firms? The obsession with budget day (and the run-up to budget day) is not healthy."
2021-03-02T19:12:02Z,business,Business,China fears overseas market ‘bubble’; German exports to UK down 30% in January – as it happened,"And finally, here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott on Wednesday’s Budget: Rishi Sunak will use tomorrow’s budget to signal that the government’s unprecedented and continuing support for jobs and businesses must end once the economy has emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic. The chancellor will pledge to use all the tax and spending firepower at the government’s disposal to limit joblessness and business failures as the UK gradually lifts the restrictions that have left the economy almost 10% smaller than it was a year ago. But Sunak is also expected to announce that the period of doing “whatever it takes” will be relatively short lived and that action will be needed to repair the public finances once the crisis is over and recovery is underway. In a budget delayed from late last year due to the pandemic, Sunak will say: “We’re using the full measure of our fiscal firepower to protect the jobs and livelihoods of the British people.” He is expected to extend the furlough scheme, the business rates and stamp duty holidays, and maintain the £20 a week uplift in universal credit for six months. But the chancellor will say that even the relatively rapid recovery in the economy expected by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility won’t be enough to repair all the damage to the public finances caused by the biggest one-year fall in output for more than three centuries. Business groups are braced for the announcement that corporation tax will be raised from its current rate of 19%. More here:

2021-03-02T18:57:58Z,business,Business,German regulator takes oversight of Greensill Capital as crisis deepens,"The crisis engulfing Greensill Capital, a controversial bank that employs former UK prime minister David Cameron, mounted on Tuesday night when it emerged that Germany’s financial watchdog has taken direct oversight of operations at a local subsidiary of the London-based lender. Greensill Capital is seeking insolvency protection in Australia and a rescue deal with new and existing backers, after two Swiss banks announced they were closing funds linked to the business over concerns about its true value. Australian founder Lex Greensill, who with his brother Peter has made billions from the venture, is battling to ensure it survives the crisis. A spokesman said the bank had “entered a period of exclusivity with a leading global financial institution” over securing emergency funding.
The bank, which specialises in supply-chain finance where businesses borrow money to pay bills, was plunged into crisis on Monday when Credit Suisse suspended $10bn (£7.2bn) of funds linked to Greensill, warning that there were “considerable uncertainties” about the true value of the assets. Swiss asset manager GAM Holdings on Tuesday said it was also closing its $842m GAM Greensill supply chain finance fund because of “market developments and resulting media coverage”. Germany’s banking regulator BaFin has in recent weeks had a special representative working at Greensill Bank, a subsidiary lender based in the north-west town of Bremen. That person is reported to have taken day-to-day control of operations there, according to the Financial Times and Bloomberg. The regulator, which has been conducting an audit of the bank since autumn, declined to comment. While Greensill is mostly based in London it is exploring “safe harbour” insolvency protection in Australia, according to the Financial Times. The company is registered in the Queensland city of Bundaberg, the home town of Lex Greensill. A spokesman for Greensill declined to comment about the reported German intervention, the Australian insolvency proceedings or the withdrawn funding from Credit Suisse and GAM. He said: “There has been an ongoing regulatory audit of the bank since autumn. This regulatory audit report has specifically not revealed any malfeasance at the bank. We have constructive ongoing dialog with all regulators in all jurisdictions where we operate.” He confirmed Greensill had entered a “period of exclusivity with a leading global financial institution”, with a view to concluding a transaction this week. “The transaction is expected to include large parts of Greensill’s business and its assets under management. While the structure of the new business is still being determined, we expect the transaction will ensure the majority of Greensill clients will continue to be funded in the same way as they currently are while also preserving a substantial number of jobs.” The niche lender, which provides financing to help companies spread the cost of their supply bills, relies on investors such as those brought in by Credit Suisse, to buy its assets. The moves by GAM and Credit Suisse deprive it of sources of funding. Greensill promotes an interview he gave to the Australian Financial Review in 2018 about his success.
“The business is extraordinarily capital efficient and we’ve invested fully ourselves in growing the business because we wanted to maintain control,” Greensill said in the interview, promoted on this bank’s website. “The firm is still substantially owned by myself and the staff and I’m very proud of that … Dozens and dozens of our employees have become millionaires on the back of this.” Cameron, a senior adviser to Greensill, regularly promotes the bank overseas. In December 2019, Cameron said: “From its UK foundations, Greensill has taken on the world, upending traditional financing models and democratising capital to give businesses, including many SMEs and small traders, access to low-cost funding.” Before he formed Greensill in 2011, Lex Greensill, 44, worked in supply chain financing at Morgan Stanley and Citibank. He was also a “crown representative” to the UK government on supply chain finance, and was awarded a CBE for services to the economy in the Queen’s 2017 birthday honours."
2021-03-02T18:05:45Z,business,Business,UK green recovery: 'government stuck in past' warns Labour,"Public investment is desperately needed to kickstart a green economic recovery in the UK, but the government is stuck in the past and reluctant to make the interventions needed, Labour has warned. Ed Miliband, shadow business secretary, told the Guardian: “We need a proper green stimulus. Governments all around the world are recognising that if you want to do the transition [to net zero carbon emissions] governments need to step up. But this government is incredibly reluctant to do what is necessary.” He blamed an outlook of free-market Conservatism that he said was failing to keep up with the need for economic intervention that the challenges of Covid-19 and the climate crisis demand. “This government is allergic to the kind of industry support and intervention that is required. They are stuck in the past, fundamentally they believe in leaving it to the market – but the market can’t cure this.” Rishi Sunak, chancellor of the exchequer, will unveil this year’s budget on Wednesday and is expected to nod towards a green recovery with £22bn for a new infrastructure bank, and cash for hi-tech projects such as hydrogen and carbon capture. But Miliband warned that key measures, such as renovating homes to make them low-carbon, supporting key industries in the transition to net zero emissions, and overhauling key sectors such as transport and agriculture were likely to be missing. “There is a massive chasm between this government’s green rhetoric and their lack of action,” he told the Guardian. “This budget is the last chance to get the green recovery right.” He called for measures to help key industries reduce their emissions, including aerospace, car manufacturing and steel-making. “The government has high ambitions [for these industries] but is offering low support for them,” he said. For instance, he said, the government set a target of banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, but made little move to put in place a charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. On renewable energy, the government has encouraged the building of offshore windfarms, but done little to help companies set up manufacturing in the UK, so that most of the turbines will be made overseas. Miliband also pointed to the chaos surrounding the green homes grant, the flagship green measure announced in last year’s stimulus spending plan. The grant, which provides up to £10,000 for people to insulate their homes and install low-carbon heating, has proved popular, with more than 100,000 applications submitted and many more people wishing to apply. But poor implementation meant fewer than 3,000 measures were installed in the first six months, while many applicants have been left unanswered and builders unpaid. Sunak now intends to withdraw more than £1bn in unspent funding, and may axe the scheme altogether. That would leave the UK without any plans for cutting greenhouse gas emissions from homes, which make up 40% of the UK’s carbon output. Meanwhile, new homes are being built to poor standards of insulation and with high-carbon heating. Miliband said: “It’s because the attitude of the government is to leave it all to the market. It has been privatised and outsourced, with a piecemeal approach. The money could have been given to local authorities more effectively. The way to do this is to renovate housing street by street.” Even the former Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, has called for a more interventionist policy. Cameron, who was prime minister from 2010 to 2016, recalled his experience in leading the UK after the financial crisis of 2008. “My advice would be, from what I learned, is that as well as the framework [of climate and economic policy], you have to roll up your sleeves and be quite muscular in your interventionism,” he told the Guardian in an interview. “The government has got a strong framework for green energy policy and in green investment, much of which we put in place, but it needs to combine that with active assistance and helping with key green investments that can make a difference,” he said. “There’s every opportunity for this recovery to be a green recovery.” A government spokesperson said: “The UK is leading the world in tackling climate change. We are powering forward with the prime minister’s 10-point plan and our energy white paper, implementing our commitments at speed so the UK can build back greener and meet its net zero target. This year we will bring forward further bold proposals, including a net zero strategy, to cut emissions and create new jobs and industries across the whole country – going further and faster than almost any other nation towards protecting our planet for this generation and those to come.” Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, also called for more investment in greening homes, saying reports that the green homes grant would be axed were “deeply concerning”. The Lib Dems are proposing £150bn in spending over three years in areas on green recovery measures. “In the year of Cop26, the chancellor has a real opportunity to seize the initiative and show that the UK is a world leader in tackling the climate emergency. To show global leadership and build a strong recovery from Covid-19 we need real ambition from the chancellor,” he said. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, joined the calls for investment in green jobs and infrastructure, which she said would bring widespread benefits to the economy and to people’s health and wellbeing. “We are still waiting to see the policies and action backed up with the necessary investment to build back greener,” she warned. “The success of the G7 and Cop26 summits this year in leading to greater climate ambition depend on the UK demonstrating true leadership, rather than just talking about it – and the budget is the last opportunity to do that.”"
2021-03-02T16:09:47Z,business,Business,Hotel Chocolat boosts sales as fans feed craving online,"Chocoholics turned to the internet during the Covid-19 pandemic, helping Hotel Chocolat increase sales and profits despite the high street lockdowns. The Cambridgeshire-based company said it had achieved sales growth in the UK as well as in its key new markets – Japan and the US – even while stores and cafes were closed for much of the year. Online sales more than tripled as Angus Thirlwell, the chief executive and co-founder, said the company had “found ways to keep the Chocolat flowing”.
He said the firm had doubled its distribution system in St Neots to help drive growth through partners including Amazon, Ocado and John Lewis, as well as its own website. The company added 600,000 new online customers in the UK and now plans to open three new outlets, including one in Edinburgh, as well as reopening all existing sites. Group revenue rose by 11% to £102m and pretax profits rose 3% to £15.5m in the six months to 27 December. Sales in the US rose 47% in October, although stock shortages held back growth in December. In Japan, sales more than tripled as Hotel Chocolat opened 11 new outlets with its joint-venture partner, taking the total to 19.
Thirlwell said stores in smaller community locations such as Harrogate, in Yorkshire, and Hitchin, in Hertfordshire, had fared well when they had been allowed to open – as more people were exploring their locality while working from home. He said things had proved tougher in city centres. “A number of locations are going to take a while to come back but we are in it for the long run,” he said. The group is taking on 130 new staff – in a variety of roles from data analysis to engineers and store staff. Thirlwell said he did not expect to pay back business rates relief and furlough pay for store staff while stores had to be shut. “The intention of the government support was to prevent knee jerk redundancies to help businesses keep growing. We are UK-based and pay all taxes here and are hoping to keep paying lots more as we grow and recruit more people,” he said."
2021-03-02T15:11:47Z,business,Business,Taylor Wimpey sets aside £125m to improve fire safety in apartment blocks,"Taylor Wimpey, one of the UK’s biggest housebuilders, has set aside £125m to replace cladding and carry out other fire safety work on its apartment buildings after huge flaws were uncovered in the wake of the 2017 Grenfell fire. The company said the fund would support fire safety work for leaseholders in apartment blocks built in the past 20 years, including those below 18 metres in height. “We have taken this decision in order to provide certainty for customers and leaseholders and to avoid them bearing the cost of investment to ensure their buildings are safe,” said Pete Redfern, the chief executive. “Many leaseholders have been left with unreasonably large bills to ensure their properties are safe and in line with post-Grenfell fire safety standards.” Thousands of buildings around the country have become the subject of a growing building safety crisis, as inspections have unearthed potentially dangerous materials used for cladding and insulation, missing fire breaks and other issues. Many owners of flats have been receiving huge bills for fire safety measures as a result, rising in the worst case to more than £100,000. Taylor Wimpey initially set aside £40m to remove and replace ACM (aluminium composite material) cladding on high-rise towers after the Grenfell fire in west London, which killed 72 people. It has completed work on 12 out of 19 apartment buildings so far. Following new government guidance on fire safety improvement requirements issued last month, Taylor Wimpey has identified a further 232 apartment buildings that may require fire safety work. The government recently promised £3.5bn of extra funding to remove unsafe cladding from high rises more than 18 metres high, on top of £1.6bn announced last year. It also offered long-term low-interest loans to leaseholders in lower buildings, but this was criticised by Labour as an “injustice”.
For buildings owned by Taylor Wimpey, the company will fund and oversee fire safety work, regardless of whether they are eligible for the government’s building safety fund. If Taylor Wimpey no longer owns the building and it is not eligible for government funding, where a freeholder “produces a fair and proportionate plan” for fire safety improvement works, the firm will contribute funding. The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said: “This is the responsible approach that I expect developers across the country to take and I’m calling on others to do the right thing as well. Where the industry has not yet done so, the government is stepping in with over £5bn in funding to protect leaseholders from the costs of cladding remediation.” Taylor Wimpey’s new £125m fire safety fund was announced as it unveiled a 68% drop in pretax profits to £264m for 2020, which it described as “an unusual and volatile year”. Building sites shut down for a few weeks during the first coronavirus lockdown last spring. Taylor Wimpey completed 9,609 UK homes last year, down nearly 40% from 15,719 the year before. The average selling price of private homes rose 5.9% to £323,000."
2021-03-02T12:11:31Z,business,Business,Ofgem faces National Grid challenge over energy earnings plan,"National Grid has ignited an industry rebellion against the energy regulator by taking Ofgem’s plan to cut energy network company earnings to the competition watchdog. The company said it would refer parts of Ofgem’s new regulatory plan to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) because it does not allow large enough returns for its investment in the UK’s gas pipes and electrical cables. Other transmission cable operators, including Scottish Power and SSE, followed suit hours after National Grid announced that it would appeal against the five-year regulation plan that will cut returns for the companies by almost 40% from this April. The Guardian understands that gas network operators including SGN, Wales and West Utilities, Cadent and Northern Gas Networks may also challenge Ofgem’s regulation before the deadline for appeals on Wednesday. The industry revolt began brewing last summer when Ofgem initially set out plans to halve the returns allowed on investment in the UK’s transmission cables and gas pipes to protect household energy bills. The multibillion-pound investments are ultimately paid for by energy consumers, and typically make up one-fifth of the average household energy bill. Ofgem softened its stance at the end of last year by raising the energy company’s allowed returns on investment from its original proposal of 3.95% to 4.3% for the next five years. The rate is still the lowest ever proposed for a regulated network company, and well below the 5.6% suggested by National Grid. In the past, the regulator has been criticised for allowing energy network firms to rake in bigger than expected profits, by approving company spending plans that are higher than necessary and plans to recover generous returns from energy bills. Senior executives have speculated that Ofgem may feel under pressure to prove that it can be tough on company profits. John Pettigrew, the chief executive of National Grid, said Ofgem had “ultimately ignored certain evidence” presented by the industry in its consultation, and had underestimated the financial risk of its major infrastructure investments by setting returns that are too low. Ofgem said the rate was based on an assumed cost of equity of 4.55%, which it believes could fall lower if companies perform better than their efficiency targets. Pettigrew described the so-called “outperformance wedge” as “a curious mechanism” that is “conceptually and practically flawed”. Energy network bosses at SSE and Scottish Power have raised the same concerns in their appeals. Rob McDonald, the managing director of SSEN Transmission, said the appeal raised “technical but very important issues”. These include the “unacceptable risk” of a new mechanism to approve extra spending during the fixed five-year period without a right to appeal against the spending amount, and a change that could put SSE on the hook if National Grid’s electricity system operator undercharges energy consumers on their behalf. National Grid said its credit rating faced a downgrade based on the parts of the regulation that it would accept, but it would continue to pay a rising dividend to its shareholders. Instead of tracking the retail prices index, the dividend would track the consumer prices index, it said.
Akshay Kaul, Ofgem’s networks boss, said the regulation “drives a fair price for consumers, improves services and boosts green energy investment”. “We respect the Competition and Markets Authority appeal process, where we will defend robustly our decisions which are in the best interests of consumers and tackling climate change,” he said. “While the appeals could take around six months to resolve, they will not delay any investment and we look forward to working closely with industry to accelerate investment for a green recovery.”"
2021-03-02T11:42:52Z,business,Business,Aldi and Lidl lose out as UK online grocery sales hit new heights,"Aldi and Lidl have lost share of the grocery market for the first time in more than a decade, while Tesco’s share rose for the first time since 2016, amid a surge in online shopping during the pandemic. Online grocery sales accounted for a record 15.4% share of the market in the four weeks to 21 February, up from 8.7% last year, as all the big supermarkets increased their provision for deliveries, according to market analysts Kantar. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail at Kantar, said: “Nearly a quarter of households bought groceries online during the past month, making the most of home deliveries especially to get hold of bulkier goods like canned foods, breakfast cereals and soft drinks. It’s been an extraordinary 12 months for online.” He said 3m tonnes of food had been delivered to people’s homes over the past year and the habit seemed to be sticking, with those who bought online happier about the service they received than those who shopped in stores. The switch to home deliveries, and a desire to shop either in a big supermarket that can supply everything or a handy small local store, led to a change in fortune for Lidl, which does not sell online, for the first time since 2010. Its fellow German discounter Aldi last year began offering online orders for picking up in store, or for home delivery via Deliveroo, in a limited number of outlets. It has been losing market share since May 2020. Last month was the first time in decade that both Aldi and Lidl lost share. McKevitt said the discounters’ sales “are up and up strongly, but sales are up more everywhere else. They have lost an opportunity but there is a question of what will happen once the pandemic ends.” He said Tesco, by far the UK’s biggest supermarket business, had benefited from all the trends – increasing sales online, at its large supermarkets and at its small Tesco Express stores. Morrisons, Iceland and independent convenience stores also continued to gain share. Supermarkets and other grocers have been enjoying strong sales during the pandemic. With cafes, restaurants and many school and workplace canteens closed, British shoppers spent an extra £15.2bn on groceries in the past year, cooking up 7bn more meals at home and an additional 2bn cups of tea. The average household has spent £4,800 on groceries in the pandemic so far, an increase of £500 compared with normal times. The pace of sales growth rose to 15.1% in the four weeks to 21 February, the fastest pace since June last year when lockdown was still in place.
With lockdown restrictions beginning to ease later this month, a year on from a spike in sales amid fears of a national lockdown, McKevitt said he now expected sales to start dropping back year on year. “We will have annualisation against last March when there was stockpiling and 20% sales growth,” he said. “As soon as the pandemic unwinds and out-of-home dining opens, including school canteens, there will be a change. As the year goes on, and hopefully the [pandemic] situation gets better, the performance [of supermarkets] is going to get worse.” McKevitt added that not all spending in supermarkets had increased. “With fewer social occasions in the diary, personal care has fallen down the agenda and spending on toiletries dropped by 1%. Liquid soap and hand sanitisers proved to be an understandable exception and sales grew by 127% over the past year,” he said."
2021-03-02T08:00:43Z,business,Business,‘I don’t have money for food’: millions of unemployed in US left without benefits,"Before the pandemic hit Stephanie Gaither worked as a driver for Uber and Lyft in Indianapolis, Indiana, making around $600 to $900 weekly. Now she is facing eviction and has her utilities shut off. Like millions of other Americans who have seen their work dry up as the virus has spread, Gaither has fallen through the huge holes in the US’s unemployment benefits system. Her unemployment benefits expired in December 2020 and she has waited several weeks without any benefits while caring for her children who are currently learning remotely. “I don’t get help from anyone so it’s really stressful. So many nights I can’t sleep. We’re running out of dog food and food for us. I do get food stamps and thankfully they just increased it, but I’m always running out. My credit is now shot. I’m depressed, I have no motivation, I feel hopeless,” said Gaither. “I have absolutely nowhere to go if I’m evicted. That means we won’t be able to keep our dog we’ve had for eight years and my kids will lose most or all of their stuff. We’ll be living in my van in the middle of winter. If I’m evicted, I won’t be able to take much with me. I still haven’t taken down Christmas decorations. What’s the point? If I’m evicted I lose all that too. All of this could have been avoided if they sent out more stimulus checks and I received unemployment.” State unemployment systems continue experiencing long delays, backlogs of unemployed claims, errors and long arbitration periods that have left millions of workers in the US without any unemployment benefits while they are out of work due to the coronavirus pandemic. An analysis of unemployed workers in January 2021 by the labor economist Eliza Forsythe at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, estimated unemployment systems are currently only reaching at most 30% of all unemployed workers, leaving an estimated 8 million unemployed Americans not receiving benefits. Several states still have thousands of unemployed claims backlogged. Total initial weekly unemployment claims have declined in recent weeks but have remained higher than the worst week of the 2008 recession for 49 straight weeks. The US labor market currently has 9.9m fewer jobs than before the pandemic. According to a Washington Post analysis in January 2021, more than 1.2 million Americans were waiting on appeals to denied unemployment claims or for their initial claims to be processed. Officially the US unemployment rate is 6.3% but as the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, noted last month the real unemployment rate in the US is closer to 10% when misclassification errors are taken into account. And the situation for many of those out of work is getting worse. Delays in extending unemployment benefits across the US that expired on 26 December 2020 cost unemployed workers $17.6bn in lost benefits in the month of January 2021, according to an analysis conducted by the Century Foundation. Another delay is possible as pandemic unemployment benefits are set to begin expiring again for millions of Americans starting on 14 March if Congress doesn’t act to extend them in time. Millions who have relied on unemployment benefits for the past year of the pandemic may also be faced with expensive tax bills in April on their unemployment income. Sherill Lewis of Fort Collins, Colorado worked as a server at the same restaurant for 12 years before the coronavirus pandemic hit in March 2020. Since her unemployment funds expired on 26 December, she has yet to see benefits restart along with many other jobless workers in Colorado. She also didn’t receive the last federal stimulus check of $600. “I’ve had to borrow money. I’m into debt with my credit cards. It’s been horrible,” said Lewis. New Jersey has taken several weeks to restart benefits for 75,000 unemployed workers in the state whose benefits had expired in December 2020, but has yet to restart benefits for many still unemployed. The state’s labor department also noted about 20,000 claimants experience holds to their claims every week after answering a question wrong on their weekly claim. Jackie Warner of Lakewood, New Jersey, lost her position in payroll when the pandemic started in March 2020. It took until May to start receiving benefits, and she hasn’t received anything since her pandemic benefits expired in December 2020. “This has been an awful time for many of us. When we call the Reemployment Center we cannot get through on the phones. There is a message that states to call back the next day. The next day never comes,” said Warner. “It’s still a mess.” The Biden administration’s $1.9tn Covid relief plan passed the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives on Saturday. It would pay $1,400 to struggling Americans if it passes in the Senate. But for those struggling now, there is little relief. Warner has applied for dozens of jobs around her area through the pandemic, with no luck, while she has no income because her unemployment benefits have yet to restart. “I’ve lost my health insurance; my car is in desperate need of repairs and I do not have money to buy food,” added Warner."
2021-03-02T07:48:04Z,business,Business,Volvo says it will make only electric cars by 2030,"Volvo plans to sell only electric cars by 2030 in the latest move by a legacy carmaker to abandon fossil fuels that contribute to global heating. The Swedish carmaker also said it would sell its electric cars direct to consumers or via dealerships through the same simplified online portal, in a blow to the traditional model of selling vehicles via independent dealerships. Volvo had previously said it wanted half of its sales to be electric by 2025, but it said on Tuesday its new strategy – which puts it in line with the UK’s 2030 ban on internal combustion engine sales – was an “acceleration” of plans to phase out internal combustion engine sales completely.
Håkan Samuelsson, the Volvo chief executive, said the company did not want to be stuck targeting a shrinking market for petrol and diesel cars. He expected the carmaker’s sales to continue to grow as it moved to electric technology. “To remain successful, we need profitable growth,” he said. “So instead of investing in a shrinking business, we choose to invest in the future – electric and online. We are fully focused on becoming a leader in the fast-growing premium electric segment.” Rivals that have in 2021 unveiled formal plans to abandon fossil fuels include the Jaguar brand (by 2025) and luxury carmaker Bentley (by 2030). Jaguar’s move had “encouraged us to be a bit braver”, Samuelsson said. Samuelsson added that he expected the cost of manufacturing an electric car to drop to the same level as internal combustion engine cars by 2025. In the longer term, the cost of manufacturing electric cars would be lower, he said, achieved through reducing the number of complex systems in the car and cutting the number of separate computers needed. However, a customer in 2025 will probably still pay more compared with an equivalent hybrid version, Samuelsson said. Volvo last year launched its first fully electric car, the XC40 Recharge, and it will unveil a new electric 40 Series on Tuesday. However, its higher-margin premium cars allowed it to be among the more advanced European legacy carmakers in the transition away from fossil fuels, including the launch of its Polestar all-electric brand to rival US electric car pioneer Tesla. Volvo also sells several plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Its electrified portfolio meant that Volvo easily achieved EU-mandated emissions targets in 2020. That allowed it to sell emissions credits to Ford for an undisclosed sum, helping the US carmaker avoid steep fines. “There is no long-term future for cars with an internal combustion engine,” said Henrik Green, the Volvo chief technology officer. “We are firmly committed to becoming an electric-only carmaker and the transition should happen by 2030. It will allow us to meet the expectations of our customers and be a part of the solution when it comes to fighting climate change.” The company recorded its best-ever profits in the second half of 2020 as the Chinese market rebounded from the fall in sales at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.
Volvo is owned by Geely, a Chinese conglomerate run by billionaire Li Shufu that also owns British sportscar brand Lotus and British electric taxi and van manufacturer LEVC. Geely, one of the few large Chinese carmakers not controlled by the state, has sought to expand in recent years. Volvo and Geely Autos last week scrapped plans to merge their operations, but said they would share more electric vehicle technology and software. Many legacy automotive companies have forged closer links with other brands within larger groups or even between competitors in order to spread the costs of electric vehicle development. Volvo’s move to online sales is part of a broader move by carmakers to build direct relationships with customers. It could also reduce under-pressure dealerships’ independence and ability to negotiate. Samuelsson said it would not reduce dealer profits, but that standardised bundles of optional extras would cut the costs of offering extensive lists of trim and technology choices. The carmaker will aim to bundle connected services such as insurance, servicing and home charging."
2021-03-02T07:08:12Z,business,Business,London stock market review should help ordinary investors – not just tech,"You would be forgiven for concluding from the pre-publicity that Lord Hill’s review of the London stock market’s listing regime, due to land before the chancellor’s budget on Wednesday, is solely about how to encourage more technology companies to float in the UK. That’s certainly a central aim, and there’s a fair argument that, if London wants to keep pace with New York, a few old practices should be ditched. One would be the rule that says companies with dual classes of shares can’t be included in stock market indices such as the FTSE 100. Founders of tech companies, unfortunately, tend to be control freaks obsessed with keeping “golden shares” in their creations. Nobody bats an eyelid in the US about voting inequality. The UK, which has made a fuss for decades, may have to yield to stay attractive. Purists will hate a backwards step on governance; pragmatists can probably live with it. Two other areas of Hill’s review, though, feel at least as important. Please, let’s not also embrace the current American fad for special purpose acquisition companies (Spacs), or “blank cheque” shell companies that raise money from investors first and only then look for something to buy. The UK’s rules on Spacs are clunkier (and thus less attractive for sponsors) for a reason: given the potential for abuse, outside investors need time to scrutinise insiders’ deal-making. Hedge funds, in search of faster action, seem to be the main lobbyists for looser Spac rules. Ignore them. There is no need for London to lower its standards on that front. Rather, let’s hope Hill has listened to the quieter lobby that has called for ordinary retail investors, the forgotten players in the stock market, to be put back into the flotation, or IPO, business. Some 20 years ago, it was common for consumer-facing brands, when coming to the stock market, to include a retail offer to ordinary investors alongside the pitch to City institutions. These days retail offers in IPOs are rare. Dr Martens, the boot firm, and Moonpig, the online greetings card retailer, devoted acres of their recent prospectuses to boasts about the loyalty of their customers. Neither company, though, acknowledged that loyalty by giving customers a chance to buy shares at public launch. Both IPOs were institutions-only affairs and regular punters only had a chance to buy after the “pop” in prices on the first day of dealings. Not every float is a flyer (remember Aston Martin) but equality of access to new issues should be a question of basic fairness. Hill could usefully recognise that technology has solved many of the City’s standard grumbles about retail IPOs. PrimaryBid, the smart platform trying to open up access to capital markets, proved last year at follow-on fundraisings for Taylor Wimpey, Compass Group and others that the involvement of retail investors doesn’t have to slow the process. Those capital-raises were conducted at speed. The software is as smooth as online banking. Rather, the main impediment is the so-called “six day” rule that is triggered when shares are offered to individual investors via IPOs. The rule is intended to ensure everybody has time to read the prospectus, but it was designed in the days when documents were sent by post. Just scrap it. By way of flourish, Hill could recommend that 10%, say, of shares in a float above a certain size are reserved for private investors. That would shake things up. One doubts he’ll go that far, but a prod to boards to remember regular punters, who in any case tend to be less fickle than the average professional fund manager, would be a start. So, yes, by all means obsess about the need for more tech companies in London. It’s an important cause. But the other tech-inspired revolution should be one that removes the IPO barriers that have been thrown in front of individual investors. The Hill review, potentially, is an important moment for the London stock market. Start from the principle that public markets need to be open fully to the public."
2021-03-02T00:01:33Z,business,Business,"Plug-in hybrid cars burn more fuel than tests record, says Which?","Plug-in hybrid cars burn significantly more fuel than official tests record, according to research that suggests pollution from the vehicles could be much worse than advertised. Tests of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) by Which?, the UK consumer group, found that some popular cars achieved as little as a third of the fuel economy advertised in official tests. Cars produced by BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Volkswagen and Volvo were among 22 tested that on average burned 61% more fuel than in official tests. The worst performer was BMW’s X5 plug-in hybrid SUV. It achieved 188.3 miles per gallon in official tests, versus only 52.8 miles for Which?. That 72% efficiency difference could potentially add more than £650 a year in petrol costs, the group said. The extra fuel burned would result in higher carbon dioxide emissions, as well as increasing running costs for owners. The average extra cost was £462, Which? estimated. Plug-in hybrids combine an internal combustion engine with an externally rechargeable battery, in the hope of lowering emissions of CO2 and other pollutants while also giving the range and refuelling ease of fossil fuels. However, the environmental benefits of PHEVs – often fitted in bulky SUVs – are controversial. The car industry argues that they are a crucial stepping stone for some consumers to move to fully electric cars, but some environmental campaigners argue that the cars can actually be less green than equivalents without a battery if they are not regularly recharged.
All cars sold in Europe must, by law, be tested according to the worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure (WLTP). Which? argues they do not accurately reflect real-world driving conditions, and so tests cars over long ranges while using air conditioning and the radio, as well as running PHEVs for portions of its tests with an empty battery. Greg Archer, the UK director at Transport & Environment, a campaign group, said official fuel economy and emissions test results were “a cruel distortion of reality”. He said: “The engine in most PHEVs turns on when the car accelerates hard, or the driver switches on the heating or air conditioning. Most PHEVs have such a small battery the car can only drive around 30 miles with zero emissions and can’t be fast charged. Owners wanting to reduce their running costs, or choose a green car, should pick a battery electric model.” PHEVs accounted for 58% of all rechargeable cars sold in the biggest 18 western European markets in January, according to data from Matthias Schmidt, a Berlin-based electric car analyst. Plug-in hybrids will remain popular over traditional internal combustion cars because of tax and subsidy advantages, he said.
The cars are also a key part of carmakers’s strategies to cut their average carbon emissions and avoid steep fines. Volkswagen and Jaguar Land Rover, the UK’s largest automotive employer, are among the carmakers who have been forced to pay out millions of euros for breaching EU targets in 2020. Which? put its findings to all of the carmakers whose products were tested. Those who responded highlighted that PHEVs can lower emissions if recharged as recommended. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the UK industry lobby group, said carmakers were not allowed to publish emissions data other than WLTP. He added: “The WLTP tests consistently demonstrate that plug-in hybrids offer comparable range to pure petrol or diesel equivalents but deliver substantial emission reductions, with zero-emission range typically 25-40 miles, which is more than ample, given that 94% of UK car journeys are less than 25 miles.”"
2021-03-02T00:01:33Z,business,Business,City firms made plans in Brexit run-up to move assets worth £100bn to EU – survey,"City firms revealed in the final months of 2020 that they planned to shift nearly £100bn in assets to the EU, taking the total value of assets lost to the bloc since the Brexit vote to £1.3 trillion, according to a new survey. The data from consulting group EY pointed to a last-minute push by firms before 31 December after the UK-EU trade deal did not offer concessions for the UK’s dominant financial services sector. It forced companies to move staff and assets to the continent in order to continue serving EU customers. According to EY’s latest Brexit tracker, which covered the period from October 2020 to February, firms have shifted or declared plans to move approximately £500bn worth of those assets in the last two years alone. Goldman Sachs was among them, having shifted around $40bn-$60bn (£29bn-£43bn) worth of assets to its Frankfurt operations at the end of 2020. It has also emerged that JP Morgan Chase was planning to relocate €200bn (£173bn) worth of assets to Germany as part of its own Brexit preparations. It is understood that process is still going on. London was dealt a blow last month after separate data showed Amsterdam had overtaken the UK capital as Europe’s largest share trading centre. That was due to EU rules that require shares traded in euros to be traded on EU exchanges or in countries with special “equivalence” status – which has not been granted to Britain. However, the EY survey showed that the rate of increase of job moves slowed, with the total number of employees shifted abroad rising to nearly 7,600 from 7,500 in October.
Experts believe there will continue to be a slow trickle of business shifting overseas, even as UK and EU negotiators reportedly near an agreement on how they plan to share information about financial market rules. That agreement is seen to be a precursor to negotiations for market access for the financial services sector. Omar Ali, a managing partner covering financial services at EY, said: “Financial services firms across Europe have a number of chapters still to write before they can close the book on Brexit. “After the major hurdle of standing up new EU hubs, the days of significant swathes of asset and job relocation announcements appear to have passed and will likely be replaced by the slower yet ongoing movement of people and assets to Europe for compliance purposes.”"
2021-03-01T20:18:35Z,business,Business,City watchdog scraps bonuses for its top staff after LC&F scandal,"The City watchdog is scrapping performance-related pay and bonuses for senior executives, and also plans to impose salary cuts, as it faces criticism over its handling of the London Capital & Finance (LC&F) investment scandal. After an outcry about the Financial Conduct Authority’s failure to properly police the collapsed firm, the regulator’s chair, Charles Randell, told MPs that there would be a crackdown on remuneration. He said: “We decided that the consequences that flow from this should be collective. It was clearly the case that the FCA wasn’t sufficiently joined up across its various activities.” In December an independent inquiry delivered a damning verdict on the FCA’s role in the LC&F failure and said responsibility for some key failings rested with its executive committee and former chief executive Andrew Bailey, now governor of the Bank of England.
Giving evidence to MPs on the Treasury select committee on Monday, Randell apologised for the mistakes that were made and said the board had to consider consequences for FCA staff. He said that was why the board had cancelled bonuses for the executive committee for 2019-20, and added: “For 2021 there’s been a discussion about performance-related pay, and the executive committee, despite having performed in my view outstandingly in its response to Covid, considered that in light of the impact of that on the country, it would be wrong for them to be considered for performance-related pay in the current year.” Randell said it had also been decided that executive committee members “shouldn’t receive performance-related pay in the future” and that in addition the board should take this opportunity to reduce both higher pay packages for committee members and the average level of executive pay. The FCA’s executive committee oversees the watchdog’s general strategy, direction and activities, including its annual business plan, and the watchdog’s website lists eight individuals as members, including new FCA chief executive Nikhil Rathi, who took the post in October 2020, and Megan Butler, who was one of three senior individuals named in the critical report on LC&F. However, last week the FCA announced four new appointments to its executive team. When LC&F collapsed in January 2019, more than 11,600 people had invested a total of £237m at an average of £20,000 each. Its “mini-bonds” had promised returns to investors of up to 8% a year. Mel Stride MP, chair of the committee, told Randell that some observers may feel that with this type of case, “the buck never really stops anywhere”.
Randell replied: “I think the buck stops with me.” However, he said that in terms of the ambition to change the organisation and make it “as good as I would like it to be, in my view [that] will not be realised for a number of years”. Randell also said that, looking at the system as a whole, including the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and the Financial Ombudsman Service, the majority of staff were dealing with “cleaning up the mess” relating to problems that had already happened, rather than prevention. “That is a crazy system,” he added. “We have got to be preventative as our absolutely first priority.” The FCA chair also said that high-risk financial products had become “much more accessible … A lot of things are done on a one-click basis, and a lot of huge mistakes are made on a one-click basis”. He said there needed to be a redesigning of the “consumer journey” so that it was fit for the digital age."
2021-03-01T19:41:24Z,business,Business,Global markets rally as hopes for sustainable economic recovery rise,"Global stock markets rallied on Monday amid rising hopes for a sustainable economic recovery from Covid-19 and as investors’ concern over a sell-off of government bonds fizzled out. The FTSE 100 gained more than 100 points to finish the day 1.6% higher at 6,558, as markets in the US and Europe recorded strong advances after a bout of sustained selling pressure last week had left investors nursing heavy losses. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones climbed by more than 600 points, a rise of about 2%, closing at 31,535, while the S&P 500 gained 2.4% after a key business survey showed that factory output rose at the fastest rate for three years in February. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose by 2.6%, while France’s Cac 40 and Germany’s Dax rose by about 1.6%. In Japan, the Nikkei jumped 697 points, or 2.4%, to 29,663. After a steady climb over recent weeks, bond yields eased on both sides of the Atlantic as US central bank officials downplayed inflation concerns that have fuelled investor fears and a sell-off in government debt markets over recent weeks. Thomas Barkin, a US Federal Reserve official, told the Wall Street Journal that while there was “daylight on the horizon” for the US economy and inflation would rise, it would not soar to problematic levels. Government bond yields – which move in the opposite direction to prices in a reflection of the risks to debt investors – have been rising around the world in recent weeks amid fears that heightened government spending, economic support from central banks, and a rapid recovery from Covid-19 will give way to rising inflation. Such a shift could require higher interest rates from central banks, making access to cheap borrowing tougher for companies and households. UK inflation rose slightly in January to 0.7% and is expected to rise further over coming months as lockdown measures are relaxed, although it is still at historically low levels as the pandemic saps demand for goods and services.
The yields on 10-year UK government bonds rose to their highest level since March last week after the Bank of England’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, warned that an inflationary “tiger” might be on the loose. However, having risen from below 0.1% to more than 0.8% in the past six months, the yield on 10-year government debt fell back to slightly below 0.8% on Monday. Reduced investor concern over bond markets has helped fuel a recovery in stock markets, according to Chris Beauchamp, the chief market analyst at the financial trading platform IG Group. “Last week’s concerns have been swiftly forgotten, with a drop back in bond yields certainly helping,” he said. “Investors have jumped on a brief pullback as a chance to pile into equities ahead of the economic recovery expected in the second half of the year.”"
2021-03-01T18:45:18Z,business,Business,Steakhouse chain asks staff to 'lend 10% of wages' amid Covid crisis,"Restaurant staff at the Tomahawk Steakhouse chain have been asked to lend the business a tenth of their wages in order to help it through the latest lockdown. The chain, which operates 12 venues in Yorkshire, the north-east of England and London, wants furloughed staff to pay for their own monthly national insurance and pension payments by way of a “voluntary loan” to the company to help it plug a cashflow crunch. “The company has a short-term cashflow issue and it now requires your help and support,” the restaurant told its 500 staff in a loan agreement letter. “We need to get reopened after the end of this lockdown.” The chain said it had supported staff during the coronavirus crisis by placing them on the government’s furlough scheme, as opposed to making them redundant, and “now we respectfully ask, in these difficult times, for you to support us”. The group, which has continued to employ staff and open new sites during the pandemic, including in London in December, said it anticipated employees would have to do this as a “voluntary loan” for “three to four months”. The letter states: “Once the lockdown is eased sufficiently for the company to trade, repayment of the loan will start to occur and no further deductions will be made.” The loan agreement letter estimates that the company will deduct approximately 10% of employees’ gross pay as a loan to cover national insurance contributions and pension payments.
Neil Derrick, a regional secretary at the GMB, said the loan scheme exploited a legal loophole and was an “outrageous abuse” of the government’s furlough scheme. “It’s never been easier for businesses to access cheap money,” he said. “Yet Tomahawk is bullying its own young, low-paid staff to raise interest-free cash. Tomahawk needs to take a long hard look at its behaviour, and this legal loophole must be closed before other companies follow suit. Howard Eggleston, who founded the company in 2017, defended the scheme, saying it had been given overwhelming support from staff. “We have 500-odd staff and we have had 100% take-up on the offer to try to help the company through,” he told the Guardian. “It is a voluntary agreement, the word loan stipulates what it is, we will pay it all back. It gets us through a massive hump where we are struggling to keep going. “To be honest, I was trying to keep everyone in a job. The easier option would not have been to do that and I decided that was the absolute wrong thing to do. At the end of the day, I did what I thought was right at the time to keep everyone getting money and not being stuck with nothing.”"
2021-03-01T18:13:11Z,business,Business,Global stocks bounce back; UK and US factories suffer supply-chain woes  – as it happened,"Time for a quick recap. Stock markets have begun March in bullish mood, with strong gains on both sides of the Atlantic. Shares jumped as bond market jitters eased, a new US stimulus package approached, and regulators in America approved J&Jâ€™s single-shot Covid-19 jab. In London, the FTSE 100 closed 105 points higher at 6588, a gain of 1.6%, recovering more than half of Fridayâ€™s slump. Travel companies led the rally, along with housebuilders on predictions of a new mortgage guarantee scheme. European markets had their best day in four months, while in New York the S&P 500 has jumped over 2%, and could notch up its best day in nine months.... In the bond market, the 10-year US Treasury bond has been trading calmly at a yield of around 1.45% - down on the 1.6% it spiked to last week. On the economic front, UK factories reported a jump in supply chain problems last month as the Brexit deal and the Covid-19 pandemic caused disruption.
US manufacturers also flagged up problems getting raw materials, as the economic recovery, transport problems, and the global shortage of semiconductors all led to headaches. In Europe, though, factory growth hit a three-year high. Inflation in Germany has pushed up, and economists reckon it will keep rising this year. The Bank of England reported a slump in consumer borrowing during Januaryâ€™s lockdown, and a small drop in mortgage approvals too. Here are the rest of todayâ€™s stories:

2021-03-01T16:30:25Z,business,Business,The optimism of Australia's investors for the future has shot through the roof | Greg Jericho,"In the run-up to the release of the latest GDP figures on Wednesday, investors have become very upbeat about the prospects for the economy. But such optimism has more to do with how bad things were last year, than with the current situation, even as companies continue to record extremely strong profits growth. On Wednesday the December quarter GDP figures will reveal how the economy is recovering from the abrupt stop in production last year. And while the unemployment rate remains some 1.2% points above where it was a year ago, there will no doubt be lots of reports about how the economy is firmly out of recession. Certainly for many companies this is the case. The latest business indicators released on Monday showed a fall in profits in the last three months of the year, but this was expected because those months saw a reduction in the level of jobkeeper payments, which are counted as revenue for companies. Despite this drop, 2020 saw profits in most industries grow faster than they did throughout the past decade:
Graph not displaying? Click here And it would be easy to suggest that all of the jobkeeper payments are the reason for the big increase in profits, but the latest reports from companies shows that many companies – especially those in the retail industry – have had a boom year. The boom of course did not flow through to workers. As a general rule profit growth aligns with wages growth. Because profits are more erratic than wages, a three year average of profit growth historically moves nicely in line with wages growth. Not now:
Graph not displaying? Click here But such a disconnect does not worry investors. For while the unemployment remains well above pre-pandemic levels, investor optimism for the future has in the past month shot through the roof. One common gauge for economic outlook is the rates of government bond yields. In essence, the bond yield (or interest rate) for five- and 10-year bonds is a good indicator for where investors think the economy is headed – if they are rising then investors think interest rates will rise in the future, which is a sign that the economy is expected to improve. Last year the gap between the 10- and five-year bond yield and two- and three-year bonds was quite narrow. This suggested little hope for improvement over the long term. But by the start of this year, the 10-year bond yield had increased well above the more short-term bonds, and then over the past year the 10-year bond yield rose 0.7%pts:
Graph not displaying? Click here The gap between the five-year and two-year bond yield is now wider than it has been since April 2014 – suggesting that the market is more positive that things are getting better now than they have been since then:
Graph not displaying? Click here You can understand why there is such belief given Australia’s reliance on commodities and the increase in the prices of coal, LNG and – especially – iron ore:
Graph not displaying? Click here That price growth suggests that Australia’s mining industry remains solid and investors believe in time interest rates will rise as inflation picks up. But it also just means that they think things have improved from where they were – ie, compared with last year’s once-in-a-hundred-year collapse in production. And the reality is that while investors expect rates to increase, the five- and 10-year bond yields remains at levels that would have been record lows before the pandemic:
Graph not displaying? Click here The same goes for inflation expectations. There has been some whispers that inflation expectations are on the rise, and that as a result maybe the reserve bank will need to increase the rate before its current expectation of at least three years away. It is clear that there has been some increase in the expectations of inflation – especially since last March:
Graph not displaying? Click here But even still, the market inflation expectations is historically low. Given the strong correlation between inflation expectations of the government bond yields and actual inflation we remain a long, long way from anywhere that would have the reserve bank thinking about raising the cash rate:
Graph not displaying? Click here Yes, the outlook is much better than it was this time a year ago. But you would hope so! A year ago the pandemic was taking hold around the world and hopes of a vaccine seemed the stuff of dreams. But while the outlook has improved, it is so only compared with where we were. Compared with where thing were before the pandemic – when the economy was merely struggling along – the outlook remains much as it was, even while company profits surge."
2021-03-01T14:09:50Z,business,Business,Billionaire hedge fund boss pays himself UK record of £343m ,"The billionaire hedge fund manager Sir Chris Hohn paid himself $479m last year after his Children’s Investment (TCI) fund, recorded a 66% jump in pre-tax profits to $695m. It is believed to be the highest annual amount ever paid to one person in Britain and equates to £940,000 a day. It is 9,000 times the average UK salary and 1,700 times the amount paid to the prime minister, Boris Johnson. Hohn’s huge $479m (£343m) payday is significantly higher than the previous record of £323m paid to Denise Coates, the majority shareholder of the betting company Bet365, in 2018. The staggering amount was paid in dividends from TCI, the hedge fund Hohn set up in 2003, to Hohn’s personal company TCI Fund Management (UK) Limited, according to a filing at Companies House on Monday. The pay was for the year to 29 February 2020. The accounts for TCI Fund Management (UK) Limited, which is 100% owned by Hohn, show that it holds total shareholder funds of $1.94bn. Hohn, 54, previously employed the chancellor, Rushi Sunak, to help run his hedge fund. Hohn, the son of a Jamaican car mechanic who emigrated to Britain in the 1960s, hired Sunak in 2006. TCI’s aggressive campaign at the Dutch bank ABN Amro led to its sale to Royal Bank of Scotland, which was seen as a key reason for RBS’s near collapse during the financial crisis. Hohn has said that deal was his and not Sunak’s. Sunak left TCI in 2009.
TCI, which holds big stakes in Visa, Microsoft, Google’s owner, Alphabet, and a controversial Canadian oil transportation railway company, recorded pre-tax profits of $695m, up from $420m the year before. Turnover increased from $472m to $888m. The hedge fund, which is based in a townhouse in the Mayfair district in central London, is ultimately owned by a parent company in the Cayman Islands tax haven. “The ultimate parent undertaking is The Children’s Investment Fund Management (Cayman) Limited, an entity registered in the Cayman Islands,” the accounts state. “The ultimate controlling party is C Hohn.” Hohn is one of the UK’s more generous philanthropists and gave away $386m through his personal charity, the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, in 2019, according to the latest available accounts.
Hohn has made tackling the climate crisis central to the mission of his hedge fund and charity, and has begun to target the directors of companies that fail to disclose their carbon emissions. Hohn is the biggest single donor to Extinction Rebellion on account of the “urgent need” for people to wake up to the climate emergency. “I recently gave them £50,000 because humanity is aggressively destroying the world with climate change and there is an urgent need for us all to wake up to this fact,” Hohn said in 2019. His charity is thought to have pledged a further £150,000. The High Pay Centre’s Luke Hildyard, who campaigns against excessive executive pay, called for higher taxes on top earners such as Hohn. “The sources of hedge fund owner’s wealth include the profits of the companies they invest in and the funds provided by their super-rich clients,” he said. “Extreme payouts such as this demonstrate that there is considerable scope for highly profitable companies to pay their staff more, and for the super-rich individuals that either own or invest in hedge funds to pay more tax, so that everyone can enjoy better public services and a fairer, more cohesive society.”"
2021-03-01T13:00:22Z,business,Business,UK factory production slows amid Brexit and Covid disruption,"Britain’s manufacturers suffered from mounting supply chain disruption in February as Brexit and the third Covid lockdown weighed down growth in factory production, according to a survey. In a reflection of continuing border disruption since leaving the EU, the latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply revealed the third biggest increase in supplier delivery times on records dating back to 1992. Industrial output rose at the weakest pace in nine consecutive months of growth, as the manufacturing sector’s rebound from the pandemic was held back by worsening supply-chain disruption and rising cost pressures. According to the survey of 600 manufacturing firms, which is closely watched by the government and the Bank of England for early warning signals from the UK economy, business optimism rose to a 77-month high in February amid expectations for a sharp recovery as Covid restrictions are relaxed. The reading on the IHS Markit/CIPs purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 55.1 in February, up from 54.1 a month earlier, on a scale where anything above 50 separates economic growth from contraction. However, analysts said the index was being artificially boosted by Brexit and Covid border disruption. Unlike normal, when longer production lead times would reflect strong economic growth as firms battle to meet demand, pushing up the index, the cause this time around is negative for companies. About 58% of companies reported longer delivery times from suppliers, while only 2% saw an improvement, as international shipping delays, worldwide demand for raw materials and Brexit-related trade issues weighed on activity. Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said: “Look past the headline PMI and the survey reveals near stagnant production, widespread shipping and port delays and confusion following the end of the Brexit transition period.” In the two months since leaving the EU on terms his government agreed with Brussels, Boris Johnson has admitted there are “teething problems” affecting cross-border trade. In acknowledgment, ministers promised £20m of financial support to help small firms prepare for further customs checks still to be put in place. But rather than early issues that will fade as firms adapt, company bosses say higher costs and delays are an endemic feature of Brexit and stand as a permanently higher cost of doing business with the EU. James Brougham, a senior economist at Make UK, the manufacturing industry trade body, said over the short term these barriers were limiting the sector’s ability to fight back from the Covid recession. “The compound effects of continued Covid-19 related disruption now exacerbated by manufacturers’ cautious navigation of the new UK-EU trading arrangement has created a scenario in which logistical and supply-side challenges are limiting the rate of economic recovery for the sector,” he said. Separate figures from the Bank of England showed British households paid back £2.4bn of borrowing on credit cards, personal loans and overdrafts in January, in a reflection of weaker consumer spending during the third lockdown.
Although a smaller net repayment than during the first wave last spring, when more than £7bn was repaid in April 2020, the annual consumer credit growth rate plunged to -8.9% in January, the lowest level since records began in 1994. The total amount outstanding on credit cards and loans shrank to £199.4bn, falling below £200bn for the first time since April 2017. The mortgage market remained strong despite the latest lockdown and deadline for the stamp duty holiday at the end of March, with 99,000 new loans approved in January. While down from 102,800 in December, mortgage approvals – an indicator of future lending volumes – remained well above the pre-pandemic monthly average of 67,900."
2021-03-01T12:01:04Z,business,Business,'I shouldn't be out there in gales': Brixham fishers take Brexit hit,"Luke Selvey manoeuvred the beam trawler Emilia Jayne into Brixham harbour with a hold packed with fish after three and a half days at sea. He gave a toothy grin. “We’ve got cuttlefish, Dover sole, brill, turbot, monks ... all sorts,” the skipper said. “The fishing is the best we’ve seen for years.” But Selvey stopped smiling when he considered how much he and his crew would make out of their trip. “The problem we’ve got is that the price of the fish is terrible. It’s making things really, really difficult for us. We’re having to work much harder to try to make a buck.” The Covid crisis is partly to blame, but fishers like Selvey believe a much more fundamental factor is the Brexit deal. Almost three-quarters of the fish landed at this historic Devon port is exported to mainland Europe and extra bureaucracy and confusion over the new system has led to consignments being delayed or rejected. Buyers in France, Spain and Italy have refused to pay top whack for fish that is not as fresh as they would like, and the price of the catch landed in Brixham has dropped. Selvey and his crew receive a share of the profit their fish fetches at market. If the prices of fish plunges, their wages follow. “It means we’re going out in all conditions for maybe half the wages we we were making last year,” he said. They call going out to sea in harsh conditions “pushing weather”. “It’s dangerous for us in the fishing community to have to push more weather,” said Selvey. The hazards of fishing are keenly felt here at the moment. Close to where Selvey spoke, there is a makeshift shrine to a local fisher, Adam Harper, 26, one of two men who died when the boat the Joanna C sank 3 miles (5km) out to sea this winter. “But we have families to look after, mortgages to pay, boats to be paid for,” said Selvey. ‘“I shouldn’t be out there in southerly gales but my family needs to be fed, watered and clothed. The fleet as a whole has caught more fish this year but the money is probably down by a third. It’s depressing.” On the harbourside, the boat’s owner, Mike Sharp, went through the figures. “This boat made £16,000 last week. For the amount of fish it had caught it should have been £25,000 or £26,000,” he said.
The main catch at this time of year is cuttlefish, the vast majority of which ends up in mainland Europe. Usually it would fetch about £4.50 a kg but this year the price has been as low as £1.80. Dover sole has dropped from about £15 to £7, and plaice from £3 to £1.10. All in all, Sharp believes his business is down a third from where he was this time last year. “Everyone is paddling around trying to make money,” he said. “This is the time of year you make your money. It’s always a bit leaner in April and May when the fish are breeding. Now is when we need to make money to survive. Exporting is a nightmare. The government has called it teething problems but it’s not that. It’s disheartening to be working the same hours or more, catching the same fish and getting a third of the return.” In his office overlooking the harbour, a fish merchant, Ian Perkes, was trying to arrange deliveries to customers on mainland Europe. “It’s getting horrendous,” he said. His sales for January 2020 totalled £375,000. This January they were down to £74,000. “I’ve built this business up over 44 years. But we wonder now how long we can go on before pulling the plug.”
Perkes sent off his first consignment of fish – five different species worth a total of £5,000 – with a degree of optimism. An official noticed that the commodity code for the skate wings did not seem right, though Perkes’ staff had used the one they were given by the UK authorities. “The whole consignment was brought back. We froze some, sold some, but it was a disaster, most was lost.” Perkes reeled off other examples of consignments being rejected or delayed. He heard that one trucker had to relabel thousands of boxes of frozen fish because they were marked as being from the UK rather than Great Britain. Before Brexit a consignment required perhaps three documents; now it is around 40. “It’s going to get worse after the lockdown. At the moment the routes to France are empty. When every man and his caravan is back on the road it’s going to be even worse.” The government said it was listening to the fishing industry. A spokesperson said: “We recognise the issues businesses involved in the export of highly perishable fresh and live seafood are facing, and as such are working closely with the fishing industry and authorities in EU member states to ensure that goods can continue to flow smoothly to market. “We recently announced that the £23m fisheries support fund is being expanded to offer support to a wider range of businesses. We will be offering funding to help fishermen meet their fixed costs as businesses adjust to the new arrangements.” The government said it was holding weekly meetings with industry groups and working with Dutch, French and Irish officials to resolve issues with documentation. But Perkes said all this would never be able to make up for the damage to his business. His customers were not going to put up with fish taking longer to reach them and would look for different ways to make sure they had a fresh product. Perkes had been keen on Brexit, but now said: “Boris Johnson came here and said we were going to get all our fish back and have free trade. That’s turned out to be nonsense.” Fishing communities are nothing if not practical and pragmatic. Sean Irvine, the owner of two Brixham boats, said his business was down by a third. He voted against Brexit but said he accepted the result and the industry now needed to find ways of improving the deal.
Irvine said he believed that if the UK government accepted more regulations from the EU – which he argued the fishing industry followed anyway – a softer border between the UK and mainland Europe for perishable goods could be possible, perhaps more like the system Northern Ireland had. “What we’ve got is a hard Brexit at the moment, no matter what anyone says. We need to look again at how perishable goods are moved. We should find a more common-sense way to keep fish, sheep, cows moving. If we had that, boom, we’d be off again.”"
2021-03-01T10:31:22Z,business,Business,Halfords to repay £10m Covid furlough cash after strong sales,"Halfords has committed to repaying all the £10.7m in furlough money it received from taxpayers, thanks to stronger-than-expected sales during the latest Covid lockdown. The cycle and car parts retailer said like-for-like group sales unexpectedly jumped 6.2% in the first seven weeks of 2021. It now expects to report annual pretax profit of between £90m to £100m, above consensus estimates for £71m, as it benefits from the cycling boom during lockdown. Profits were £55.9m for the year to April 2020. The group – which has 443 stores, 367 garages and a fleet of 121 auto servicing vans – committed to repaying the furlough cash it used to keep staff on its payroll during lockdown. “Although we have continued to experience a volatile trading environment across the first seven weeks of the fourth quarter, overall trading has been stronger than we initially anticipated across the business,” Halfords said.
The company said its auto centre business grew 13% over the seven weeks to 19 February and increased its market share, thanks to strong demand for both its garage and mobile van servicing business. That was despite a 40% drop in car travel during the lockdown, compared with pre-pandemic levels. Cycling revenues also jumped 43% thanks to sales of adult and children’s bikes and “exceptional growth” from its higher-end Tredz cycling brand. Halfords has benefited as consumers increasingly turned to cycling as a way to avoid public transport during the Covid pandemic, as well as for leisure and exercise. However, the company warned over further uncertainty in the weeks ahead. “Trading patterns continue to be volatile, with sales before Easter particularly difficult to predict while the UK remains in lockdown. As the country starts to open up once more, our overriding priority remains the health and safety of our colleagues and customers,” Halfords said."
2021-03-01T10:17:32Z,business,Business,Wagamama owner burns through £5.5m a month in Covid-19 lockdown ,"The Restaurant Group, which owns the Wagamama, Frankie & Benny’s and Garfunkel’s chains, has reported a jump in takeaway orders but warned it is burning through £5.5m a month in the latest Covid lockdown. The group said it had secured another loan worth £500m that would help consolidate its debt and give it a larger financial cushion as it prepareed to reopen the rest of its sites to diners when lockdown lifts. It said orders so far this year had been encouraging and that average delivery orders in the first three weeks of February were two and a half times higher than before the Covid pandemic, while takeaway sales were five times higher. The growing appetite for takeaways has been a lifeline for the hospitality industry, after nationwide Covid restrictions blocked pubs and restaurants from serving customers on-site due to coronavirus risks.
The Restaurant Group has kept roughly half of its 400 of its sites running during the latest lockdown, primarily its Wagamama and Frankie & Benny’s brands. However, the group, which also operates the Brunning & Price pub chain, said it was burning through £5.5m worth of cash every four weeks due to current restrictions, and would continue losing cash at a similar rate until rules are lifted. According to government guidance published last week, lockdown restrictions for the hospitality industry will begin to be eased no earlier than 12 April. Indoor dining will be possible no earlier than 17 May. “With this strong operating platform in place, the group has good capability to deliver an accelerated reopening plan for dine-in trading, once the current restrictions for hospitality businesses end, with all viable sites being reopened within two weeks,” the Restaurant Group said. The company is scheduled to publish full-year results on 10 March."
2021-03-01T06:00:16Z,business,Business,Fossil fuel cars make 'hundreds of times' more waste than electric cars,"Fossil fuel cars waste hundreds of times more raw material than their battery electric equivalents, according to a study that adds to evidence that the move away from petrol and diesel cars will bring large net environmental benefits. Only about 30kg of raw material will be lost over the lifecycle of a lithium ion battery used in electric cars once recycling is taken into account, compared with 17,000 litres of oil, according to analysis by Transport & Environment (T&E) seen by the Guardian. A calculation of the resources for each relative to their weight shows internal combustion engines burn material 300 times greater than that lost once an electric car battery is scrapped. The comparison did not include potential emissions if fossil fuels were burned to create the power for recharging of car batteries. “Our previous analysis has shown that that electric vehicles emit 64% less CO2, including all the different stages like electricity generation and fuel production, but this still hasn’t shaken off the argument that electric vehicles use up a large amounts of raw materials,” said Lucien Mathieu, a transport analyst at T&E and an author of the report. “Our analysis shows that the raw material needs of EV batteries pale in comparison to the fuel burned by fossil fuel cars, which, unlike batteries cannot be recycled.” In the fossil engine/battery calculations, “we excluded the raw material needed to produce the electricity and the [fossil] fuel because this is contingent on factors such as national electricity mixes and fuel extraction efficiency. In our analysis of upstream energy use [producing the electricity and making the solar panels and turbines used to produce that electricity], we have shown that it would only make a 5% to 10% difference in total energy consumption” for electric vehicles powered by renewable energy. On other aspects of the two vehicle types, the Brussels-based campaign group said battery electric vehicles were superior to their petrol and diesel counterparts across raw material demand, energy efficiency or cost – as well as eliminating exhaust emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful gases. The accelerating move to electric vehicles will entail environmental costs. Higher battery production will require more mining of minerals such as lithium, cobalt and nickel. However, T&E argued that the cost of oil extraction for fuel represents a much greater environmental toll. The report pointed to a “double standard” used when assessing the relative merits of electric and fossil fuel vehicles, which takes the use of oil for granted. “When it comes to raw materials there is simply no comparison,” said Mathieu. “Over its lifetime, an average fossil-fuel car burns the equivalent of a stack of oil barrels 25 storeys high. If you take into account the recycling of battery materials, only around 30kg of metals would be lost – roughly the size of a football.” Developments in battery technology will reduce the average amount of lithium, nickel and cobalt required for each car, mitigating some of the increased demand for the materials as well as lowering car prices. At the same time, circular economy regulations requiring higher recycling rates could cut demand further.
On the overall energy efficiency of vehicles, T&E calculations suggest that battery electric cars will use 58% less energy than a petrol car over its lifetime and emit 64% less carbon dioxide. Emissions associated with electric cars are mainly produced in the energy-intensive manufacturing of batteries, while the vast majority of emissions associated with internal combustion engine cars come from its use. Some makers of internal combustion engines have argued for the merits of cutting emissions through hybrids that combine batteries with petrol engines, in part because of the emissions associated with producing batteries. However, Aston Martin faced a backlash last year after a report making similar claims – that the large amount of carbon used to make electric car batteries undermined the case for a switch away from petrol – was attributed to a PR company registered to the wife of a director at the UK carmaker. • This article was updated on 2 March 2021 to include an explanation from T&E as to why its battery/engine comparison excluded energy to charge the battery, and its estimate of how much the outcome would have changed had this been included."
2021-03-01T06:00:15Z,business,Business,"Coutts, the bank to rely on in a Covid crisis – if you're seriously wealthy","Workers at Coutts, the private banking division of NatWest, are used to booking lavish parties and vacations for their millionaire clients. But once Covid struck, the Queen’s bank quickly became an upmarket emergency service, with staff in its concierge arm helping to repatriate clients’ children stuck abroad on gap years and arranging emergency evacuations for customers stranded overseas. Since 2008 Coutts, which has served the Queen and every member of the royal family since George IV, has inhabited the strange role of serving the nation’s wealthiest households while also being 62% state owned after the rescue of NatWest. As such, it has drawn the line at private medical care, leaving clients to book their own tests, jabs or GP checks. But at the start of the outbreak, Coutts staff were on call around the clock until clients were home safe and sound. Chief executive Peter Flavel recalls one client who told his wife to call his personal banker if anything went wrong while he was abroad last spring. “And something did go wrong. Significantly wrong. And that banker got called up in the night, and in a very short order we are able to arrange emergency evacuations.”
It illustrates how far the 329-year-old lender will go to cater to its wealthy customers, who are used to an extreme level of personal service that high street banking customers could only dream of. The challenge is keeping private banking clients sweet during a pandemic that has barred Coutts from organising exclusive events or impressing clients with its illustrious offices. The lender has been forced to temporarily close its famous 440 Strand building in London, where it usually entertains customers on its rooftop garden – which supplies fresh fruit, vegetables and honey from its own bee hives – and serves meals from its private chef. So, like most businesses, Coutts has had to go digital. Regular meetings have shifted to Zoom and exclusive events have gone online. The bank is now hosting virtual tastings with the head of its wine supplier Tom Gilbey, and live gourmet cooking classes, featuring meals such as risotto and pan-fried goat’s cheese, with its executive chef Peter Fiori. Flavel says the online events helped clients and staff relax. But remote working, as well as a lack of casual networking that usually leads to referrals, has made it even harder to attract new clients. Coutts and its sister brand Adam & Company – which Flavel also manages under the NatWest umbrella – together attracted just 1,600 new customers in 2020, down from approximately 2,400 a year earlier. Annual operating profit for NatWest’s private banking business dropped 30% to £208m. However, existing clients are growing accustomed to less face time. Flavel says most customers – who must have at least £1m to bank with Coutts – plan to hold three of their four quarterly check-ins online after the pandemic is over. But the chief executive is not planning to abandon Coutts offices anytime soon, and hopes to get bankers and borrowers back into the atrium and portrait gallery at the Strand as soon as it is safe to do so. “I’m not thinking that I want everything to be video. I don’t think that fits the brand and who we are as a bank. But equally, I don’t think it all needs to be face-to-face,” Flavel says. Fostering a hybrid model for meetings and client services could also help attract the next generation of wealthy customers. Since taking the reins as chief executive in 2016, Flavel has been trying to appeal to celebrities, e-gamers YouTubers and social media influencers who could broaden the bank’s customer base. “Our historic client base – which still remains landowners, hereditary wealth, senior executives – remains and always will remain a very important part of what we do. But the world is changing … and wealth is being formed now in many different ways. And for us to remain modern and relevant and contemporary we have to evolve.”
While the bank does not confirm the names of its clients, British rapper Stormzy is believed to be among them, while Harry Potter star Emma Watson is known to have signed up for a Coutts course shortly after learning about the size of her wealth. Flavel said junior bankers have had to coach some of Coutts’ more experienced wealth managers on social media and digital trends that are behind new clients’ wealth. “The good thing is that our younger staff don’t need to be trained in these things because they’re of the same generation,” Flavel says. “It’s the more mature bankers that needed to be reverse mentored by the younger ones as to what this means. So it’s a good partnership,” he adds. “So really it’s about making sure we’re relevant to a new style of doing business.”"
2021-03-01T00:01:08Z,business,Business,Aviva sets target for net zero carbon footprint by 2040,"Aviva has become the first leading insurer worldwide to set a target to shrink its carbon footprint to net zero by 2040, a decade earlier than most banks. The firm, one of the UK’s top asset managers with £300bn of investments under management, said it had written to the 30 biggest CO2 emitters in its portfolio, comprising companies in the oil and gas, utilities and mining sectors, asking them to sign up to the science-based targets aligned to the Paris climate agreement and to set net zero emission goals with fixed deadlines of 12 to 36 months. If they do not take action, Aviva said it would sell its shareholdings in those companies, but added that it had been getting some good responses. It will report on progress towards its target every year. The firm has set interim targets, of a 25% cut in emissions from its investments by 2025 and a 60% reduction by 2030. It also plans to shrink CO2 emissions from its own operations and supply chain to net zero by 2030, similar to rival Legal and General. In addition, Aviva will invest £6bn in green assets by 2025. Aviva is taking more drastic action on coal. By the end of next year, it will divest from all companies which make more than 5% of their revenue from coal, unless they have signed up to the science based targets, and it will stop underwriting insurance for these firms by the end of 2021. In recent years Aviva had come under fire for being the second-biggest investor in the Polish coal industry, the most polluting in Europe. Amanda Blanc, the chief executive, said: “Aviva is taking bold steps to help tackle the climate crisis. As the UK’s leading insurer, we have a huge responsibility to change the way we invest, insure and serve our customers.” Lindsay Keenan, European coordinator of the climate campaign group Insure Our Future, said that while she welcomed divestments from the coal sector, the company should “unambiguously divest from all coal, oil and gas companies which are still developing and planning new fossil fuel expansion projects”. She said: “Aviva should also make it clear that it will not insure any new fossil fuel projects. And Aviva should install a process for transparent third-party monitoring of its progress.” The campaign group ShareAction noted that while there were pension funds that had committed to more ambitious targets, all big insurers, banks and asset managers were focused on 2050, including sustainable coalitions such as the investor-led initiative Climate Action 100+.
Wolfgang Kuhn, director of financial sector strategies at the campaign group ShareAction, said Aviva’s commitment “disturbs the convenient consensus that treats 2050 as a God-given deadline that, if met, will solve the climate crisis … Aviva makes clear that swifter action is both necessary and possible.” Kwasi Kwarteng, the business and energy secretary, said: “Business have a huge and vital role to play in tackling climate change … In order to reach our 2050 climate target, we must work with companies like Aviva to harness the strength of the UK’s world leading financial sector to unleash the private capital necessary to reduce carbon [dioxide] emissions and support new jobs as the UK builds back greener.”"
2021-03-01T00:01:08Z,business,Business,Women paid two-thirds less than men in top finance roles – report,"Female directors at the UK’s largest financial services firms are paid on average two-thirds less than their male counterparts, new research shows, underlining the pay gap that still exists between men and women at the highest levels in the financial sector. Average pay for female directors at financial services companies stands at £247,100, 66% lower than the average £722,300 paid to male directors, according to research by employment and partnership law firm Fox & Partners. The significant gender pay gap at firms listed on the FTSE 100 and 250 stock indices suggests there has been slow progress in recruiting women to more senior, higher-paid executive positions. The vast majority (86%) of the female company directors occupy non-executive roles, according to the research, which tend to be lower paid than executive positions, and involve less day-to-day responsibility for running the business. The revelations come just days after the final report in the government-backed Hampton-Alexander review into female representation in business showed that women now hold more than a third of roles in the boardrooms of Britain’s top 350 companies. However, men still dominate the highest levels of business, and the review fell slightly short of its second major target of reaching 33% representation of women on FTSE 350 leadership teams, including positions on executive committees. The Fox & Partners research underlines that firms are willing to give non-executive roles to women to improve board diversity, but are not appointing them to better-remunerated leadership positions, which also exert more influence within the company.
“Boards need to be open to challenging themselves by asking honest questions about the barriers in their organisation that might prevent women reaching the very top,” said Catriona Watt, a partner at Fox & Partners. “To see long-term change, firms must be committed to taking steps that will lead to more women progressing through the ranks, getting into senior executive positions and closing the pay gap,” she said. One way for firms to promote change would be by signing up to the government’s women in finance charter, under which companies pledge to promote gender diversity by setting internal targets for this in senior management and publishing annual progress reports on the number of women in leadership roles."
2021-02-28T15:03:24Z,business,Business,Sunak 's budget must place economic needs above party politics | Larry Elliott,"Budgets. Mini-budgets. Summer economic statements. Winter economic plans. Umpteen other impromptu announcements. Never has there been a chancellor as hyperactive as Rishi Sunak over the past 12 months. Throughout Britain’s long Covid-19 nightmare, Sunak has been shovelling money out of the Treasury to support the economy while also warning that sooner or later the spending will have to stop. That moment will arrive soon.
Economists love to argue with each other, but on one thing they seem to agree: now is not the time to start withdrawing support. Two progressive thinktanks – the Institute for Public Policy Research and the Resolution Foundation – have called on the government to emulate Joe Biden and come up with ambitious new stimulus packages. Free-market thinktanks such as the Institute for Economic Affairs and the Centre for Policy Studies say growth rather than tax rises are the way to sort out the public finances. Sunak’s interview on BBC TV’s Andrew Marr Show suggests he accepts it would be a bad idea to start sucking demand out of the economy when it is experiencing its second major contraction inside 12 months. But the chancellor’s repeated insistence that he wanted to “level” with the British people means only one thing: the budget will include plans for tax increases, some of which are likely to be post-dated. In the interview with Marr, Sunak gave two reasons why he needed to be worried about the public finances: the vulnerability of the UK to rising interest rates and the need to ensure that the public finances were in decent enough shape to allow a future chancellor to borrow more whenever the next crisis comes along. It is certainly the case that Covid has forced the government to spend and borrow more. In most years, the state runs a budget deficit because taxes don’t quite match spending, but in normal times the shortfall is relatively modest. When the independent Office for Budget Responsibility announces its latest forecasts on Wednesday, they will show the deficit running at close to 20% of the UK’s annual economic output – or gross domestic product. The national debt is the accumulation of annual deficits (and the occasional budget surplus) over time. Last year’s record peacetime borrowing has pushed debt above the £2tn level. Debt as a share of GDP is now around 100%. In other words, it is equivalent to a whole year of the UK’s output. The government covers its borrowing by selling bonds to investors and has to pay them interest for the privilege. Borrowing costs for the UK, despite the size of the annual budget deficit and the national debt – have edged up a bit in recent weeks but are still at historically low levels. Sunak is worried that they might not stay low, and that each percentage point on market interest rates adds £25bn a year to the cost of servicing the debt. Fears of a market panic seem overblown. There is no correlation between the size of the national debt and the cost of servicing it: the interest rate – or yield – on UK government bonds was higher at the start of the financial crisis in 2007 than it is now, even though the debt to GDP ratio was then below 40%. In large part, that’s due to the activities of central banks, which have been buying bonds as part of the money-creation programme known as quantitative easing. QE has the effect of driving down bond yields. What’s more, history suggests that growing the economy is an effective way of tackling debt. At the end of the second world war, the national debt was close to 250% of GDP but over the subsequent decades it gradually came down so that it ended the 20th century close to where it was in 1900 at about 30% of GDP. Some economists think the economy will bounce back so quickly from its pandemic-induced lockdown that the hole in the public finances can be filled without the need for tax increases or spending cuts. The OBR takes a more cautious view, and will say on Wednesday that action will be required if Sunak wants to cover the day-to-day spending of the state with tax revenues. The pre-budget speculation is that this figure will be £40bn, but it will certainly be higher if Sunak acts too hastily and chokes off recovery. That is precisely what George Osborne did in 2010, when he underestimated the impact spending cuts and tax rises would have on a still-fragile economy.
Sunak appears to have learned some lessons from that experience but in two respects the legacy of Osborne lives on. First, opinion polls show a strong sense among voters that there is something inherently bad about the borrowing the government is doing and that sooner or later the money will have to be paid back. Osborne justified his austerity by drawing the false analogy between government and household borrowing, and the public still struggles with the Keynesian notion that trying to reduce borrowing in a recession is counter-productive because that merely makes the slump even worse. Second, Osborne was keen to get on with deficit reduction early in the 2010-15 parliament so that the bad news was out of the way before the next election. Sunak denies that he is motivated by such base political instincts but is fooling nobody with his protestations that he is solely focused on the need to protect jobs and livelihoods. No government wants to be raising taxes as polling day approaches, and that might be the consequence of delaying the squeeze for too long. As it happens, the longer the chancellor defers inflicting pain on the economy the better. But it is coming sure enough."
2021-02-28T10:00:11Z,business,Business,Turns out selling cat memes is a purr-fect opportunity for entrepreneurs | Gene Marks,"What’s the next big opportunity for budding entrepreneurs? How about selling memes? Apparently, there’s a lot of money to be made there. Take, for example, the Nyan Cat.
The Nyan Cat was actually a YouTube video that was uploaded back in 2011 and yes, if you’ve looked at the link you’re reading that right: it has more than 185m views. The video was of an animated cartoon cat with a Pop-Tart as its body flying through the air trailing a rainbow … and accompanied by a Japanese song playing in the background. Yes, it’s bizarre, but it was and to this day remains a popular meme used by many for social media posts. According to an Artnet report, the meme made news this past week after a digital recreation was sold on the online crypto art platform Foundation for 300 Ether (Ethereum is a digital currency not unlike Bitcoin). The value as of then? About $600,000. Yes, someone paid more than half a million dollars for a digital image of a cat with a Pop-Tart body flying through the air. And we’re in a recession. What made this sale special is that it highlighted the possibilities of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Mashable’s Jack Morse said that these are “unique digital items authenticated on the blockchain that are selling for upwards of hundreds of dollars”. There are digital workplaces like Rarible and the aforementioned Foundation that sell these pieces of art and they can do so because NFT technology allows the artwork to be unique and identifiable. What’s even more enticing is that, because these tokens are digital and permanently associated with the artwork, artists can potentially also get a piece of any future resales. The meme’s creator, Chris Torres, was – as you can imagine – pleased. “Thanks for believing in Nyan Cat all these years,” he gushed on Twitter. “I hope this inspires future artists to get into #NFT universe so they can get proper recognition for their work!” Apparently, other entrepreneurial artists and digital selling platforms are also getting into the game. Foundation has only been around for a few weeks and has already sold more than $1m of digital art. And the market has heated up so much that even the well-known auction house Christie’s has entered into the sale of these digital items and will be featuring the work of Mike Winkelmann, otherwise known as Beeple, who recently sold more than $3.5m of his token-encrypted work in a single weekend last year. All of this means opportunity and the chance to make some money in the art world. “To be able to say that I’m the collector who actually owns and is a patron of this artist carries a certain kind of prestige that is really appealing to people,” Lindsay Howard, Foundation’s head of community, told the Verge. “You also get to directly support an artist, and I think that is really exciting for people.” So who would pay $600,000 for a digital meme? Why, it’s none other than someone or something called “oxy7eb2...3f6b”. Of course, it’s that person/persons. I should have guessed. What a character! It is the mysteriously dark world of digital, right? All of this is a great financial opportunity for entrepreneurial artists and the art investors and platforms who support them. And who am I to judge what is art or not? I know nothing of that. But, as a business owner, I do know something of risk. And, given the volatile nature of digital currencies (not to mention digital art) I do have some advice for Chris Torres and other entrepreneurs who are operating in this wild, wild world: Please. Seriously consider converting that $600,000 into something a little more stable – at least for now. A nice savings bond, perhaps?"
2021-02-28T07:00:06Z,business,Business,Fintech firms want to keep their golden shares. London may be forced to agree,"Financial technology, or fintech, firms like to present themselves collectively as the very model of a 21st-century industry: slick, disruptive, growing rapidly and vital for national prosperity. That self-image was endorsed on Friday by Ron Kalifa, former boss of payments processor Worldpay, in his review for the Treasury on how best to support the sector post-Brexit. “If the UK is to retain its position as a global leader in financial services, then we must lead this technological revolution,” he declared in the introduction. There is, though, one area where the UK’s fintech brigade would like to shun 21st-century practices, at least those in London, and turn back the clock. It seems they don’t like the principle of “one share, one vote” at public companies. Kalifa’s review recommended that founders and pre-flotation investors be allowed to keep shares with supercharged voting rights, even after a company has gone public. But the proposal is more nuanced. Dual voting rights are allowed on the London Stock Exchange but a company must accept a “standard” listing, which means exclusion from stock-market indices such as the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250, which are reserved for “premium” listed companies. The Hut Group, the online retailer, took that “standard” route recently. Kalifa’s proposal is that the listing rules be changed to suit the fintech crew: let founders keep control via golden-share arrangements but also award them “premium” status. In addition, Kalifa recommended changes to another traditionally important rule: that at least 25% of shares in “premium” firms must be in public hands. The report suggested a 10% “free float” would be enough. It all adds to the impression that the fintech pioneers would like the revolution to be conducted on their terms: please buy a slice of our company and help to fund it, just don’t expect traditional governance protections.
Kalifa’s report, it should be said, had many less-contentious ideas within its 108 pages, such as a privately financed £1bn “fintech growth fund” to finance earlier-stage companies and a visa “stream” to attract engineers from overseas. But the proposed changes to the listing rules will generate the most heat, not least because Lord Hill’s broader review of UK listing regulations is due soon. Is a watering-down of the rules outrageous? Well, the whiff of fintech self-entitlement is unmistakable. The principle of equal rights for equal economic risks has served the London market well. It is a cornerstone of its claim (not always solid) to uphold high standards of governance. But here’s the problem – and also the reason why, in the end, it may be best for purists to hold their noses and grant the reform. Unfortunately, Kalifa is correct when he points out that many other stock markets, from New York to Germany to Singapore, do not penalise dual-voting structures. Given that the US market has already attracted several high-profile UK tech companies – including Arrival, a £4bn electric vehicle company – the issue cannot be wished away as trivial. This may be a case of having to join the crowd if London is to keep its share of UK tech successes. A vibrant stock market is not the only measure of fintech success, of course, but it would be silly to pretend it is not important in setting the tone. “UK investors and the fintech ecosystem risk losing key company listings that wish to mature gradually into premium-listed status, rather than make a giant leap,” argued Kalifa’s report. He may be right. We’ll see what Hill’s review brings, but it feels as if the mood is shifting on this issue. Founder-led firms’ demands for concessions and golden shares feel unsporting, but, like it or not, these companies matter. There are dangers if the London stock market is seen as a backwater of banks and mining companies. A public bailout might have been easier for Barclays than this Barclays should be given credit where it is due. In 2008 it raised enough money during its emergency cash call to allow it to avoid the public bailouts that would bring Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland under state control. But the bank has traded one set of woes for another. It has spent 13 years battling claims that a deal it struck with its Qatari investors was unfair to other shareholders, and the arguments are likely to continue for a few years yet. Barclays did dodge the political pressure that plagued RBS following its £45bn bailout. That lender, rebranded as NatWest, had to slash bonuses, shrink its investment bank and rein in excesses. This has led to a persistently low share price for NatWest, delaying re-privatisation and leaving it majority state-owned. Lloyds fared better, returning to the private market in less than a decade. Having taken a £20.3bn bailout in 2008, the group managed to report its first post-rescue profit in 2010 and returned to full private ownership by 2017. Barclays chose a different path. Its former managers have plodded through two regulatory investigations, two criminal trials and a private lawsuit linked to its controversial £11bn emergency fundraising. While criminal courts found executives not guilty of wrongdoing in 2020, and a lawsuit involving the businesswoman Amanda Staveley was ruled in Barclays’ favour last week, it is still not out of the woods. The Financial Conduct Authority has resumed an investigation put on hold during the Serious Fraud Office’s doomed criminal trial. In 2013, the regulator said it was likely to fine Barclays £50m for behaving “recklessly” in the rescue deal. Barclays may also face an appeal over Friday’s high court ruling. It is unlikely to draw a line under the 2008 crisis any time soon. Trains are empty already. Making them less affordable won’t help Tomorrow, the rate of rail unaffordability accelerates a little more than usual. Just for 2021, the government has hiked the controversial annual RPI-led increase by an additional 1%. Politically, it may make sense. The change of date avoids the usual guarantee of headlines around the quiet new year period. The majority of regular passengers who might have seen hundreds of pounds added to the cost of an annual season ticket are now working from home, banishing past nightmares of cramming aboard a commuter train. Those who do travel by train enjoy unprecedented personal space and punctuality. And it is hard to question the Treasury’s commitment to the industry after a year of emergency contracts and underwriting rail services to the tune of £10bn. For all that, the decision to claw back scraps of revenue from the few remaining passengers during the pandemic appears concerning. If Britain is, as politicians of all sides endlessly proclaim, planning to build back better – and certainly if there is a wish to revive city centres – public transport cannot be allowed to wither. Perhaps, given the experiment of eating out to help out last summer, the Treasury would for now rather deter people from taking trains than risk reducing social distancing. Yet if the vaccination programme is running well enough for all constraints to be lifted by summer, it makes little sense to entrench long-term expense into the railway system. Ministers have over the past decade championed infrastructure investment, and continue to do so with HS2, even if some schemes look set to be deferred. There would certainly be hard questions about the future need for train services, should work and travel patterns remain subdued. However, a return to mass mobility and commuting, without the backbone of an affordable and efficient rail system, would be a grim, polluted, congested future indeed."
2021-02-28T00:05:38Z,business,Business,Old-school Stellantis car factories gear up for the shock of electric,"Carlos Tavares is an unashamed petrolhead, with a rally-racing hobby that harks back to an earlier automotive age. Yet carmakers like Stellantis, which he leads, and its rivals have had to set aside affection for roaring internal combustion engines as environmental rules set the limits for the industry. Stellantis was formed in January in a €50bn (£43bn) merger between France’s Peugeot and Italian-American Fiat Chrysler, in one of the clearest responses to the Tesla-driven electric revolution: the merger will allow them to share expensive investments in battery technology. It is the era-defining challenge for the automotive industry. The nerve-racking wait for an investment decision at Stellantis’s Ellesmere Port factory, home of the Vauxhall Astra family car, is an early example of the difficulties it will cause for auto companies having to reinvent their businesses – not to mention workers still manufacturing fossil fuel vehicles. Carmakers are known for being both footloose and ruthless when choosing factory locations, playing off countries against each other in search of the best deal, weighing up anything that might shave fractions of a percentage point off margins. Tavares made it clear that Ellesmere Port faced the added difficulties of Brexit and the UK’s 2030 ban on fossil fuel cars. The Brexit issue was, for the most part, resolved by the Christmas Eve agreement that secured tariff-free UK-EU trade. However, the 2030 ban has forced on to the agenda a bigger issue: whether Ellesmere Port would be upgraded from fossil fuel car production to the new electric era. A decision was expected imminently at time of publication. Tavares was stridently critical of the “brutal” pace of the UK ban – comments that laid the groundwork for a negotiating squeeze on the government for more generous financial aid. Yet for all the posturing, similar decisions will become common as Stellantis gradually leaves fossil fuels behind. Peugeot under Tavares was already on its way. It avoided EU emissions fines in 2020 by introducing plug-in hybrids and smaller electric cars like the Vauxhall Corsa-e and the Peugeot e-208, as well as cutting traditional internal combustion emissions. Its merger partner will have to learn to copy quickly. Fiat Chrysler only avoided fines by paying Tesla hundreds of millions of euros to borrow its zero-emissions credits. The Fiat 500 Electric may be promising, but otherwise it is far behind, particularly with gas-guzzling US-focused brands like Dodge and Jeep. Stellantis’s financial results, reported on Wednesday, will still observe the same division between the separate Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot arms. A detailed strategy update – outlining how the brands will share parts and designs, for instance – is not expected until April. However, the earnings expectations Stellantis reveals on Wednesday will give an idea of the constraints it will face. The outlook for the 2021 sales recovery as the pandemic eases will be key, according to analysts at UBS. They believe Stellantis will expand revenues by 12% this year, and grow profits more quickly than other traditional carmakers. Philippe Houchois, an analyst at investment bank Jefferies, argues that the winners among legacy carmakers will be those who can most adroitly manage the decline of their internal combustion engine assets. Tavares’s disciplined leadership should allow Stellantis to come out ahead of rivals, Houchois suggested in a recent note to clients. Doing so will mean a barrage of new electrified models from Stellantis as it plays catch-up – and more nervous times ahead for employees at factories that have not yet been upgraded to the electric era."
2021-02-27T19:00:32Z,business,Business,The ‘jobdobber’ hotline is another policy aimed at keeping wages low | Greg Jericho,"This week came further confirmation that even in the midst of a wages crisis, the Morrison government remains determined to push wages even lower. When you get down to it, there are really two things that define the Liberal party’s economic agenda: low taxes for wealthy people and those who own companies, and low wages growth for everyone else. The ambition of every economic policy the Howard, Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments have pursued over the course of their time in power since 1996 (and even beforehand when in opposition) has been to produce these two results.
This past week we saw the government announce a meagre increase in the jobseeker rate and an increase in mutual obligations. They also announced a hotline for employers to call to dob in unemployed people who refuse job offers – a job offer that might be declined upon discovering the wage and conditions. Such a policy serves to keep wages low – employers can offer lower wages and know that a threat hangs over people should they refuse. It is one of the most bastardly policies this government, which specialises in barstardry, has devised. And it comes at a time when low wages growth is now a permanent feature of the economy. Even in the midst of a pandemic, where economic data from GDP to retail spending has gone absolutely nuts, wages continue to grow at the exact pace expected over the past five years.
Graph not displaying? Click here Three years ago when Gareth Hutchens and I did a report into low-wages growth, wages were growing at 2% a year. This week the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed that in 2020 wages grew by just 1.4% – a record low for any calendar year. It might be low, but it is not an aberration. When unemployment goes up, more people are fighting for each job and so employers are under less pressure to raise wages to attract people to apply, or to stop current employees leaving for a better-paying job. And so in March last year when the unemployment rate was 5.2%, wages grew at an annual rate of 2.2%. In December when unemployment had risen to 6.6%, wages growth had slowed to 1.4% – exactly in line with the trend since 2016. The problem is that trend has completely fallen from what it used to be. Up until 2012 an unemployment rate of 6.6% would be usually associated with wage growth of around 3%. Even when wages growth was a bit lower than expected they were well above what we now have. In March 2000 the unemployment rate was also 6.6% and wages grew by 2.7% – a rate we have not had for nearly seven years. Wages now grow around 1.5% slower for every level of unemployment. Or to put it more starkly: for wages to grow at the pace they used to, unemployment needs to be around three percentage points lower than in the past. The Reserve Bank has said it will not raise interest rates until inflation growth is consistently above 2% and for that to occur wages would need to grow at around 3%. In the past that would have meant getting unemployment below 7%; now it means below 4%. Less worker bargaining power, more restrictions on industrial action, less need for employers to negotiate in good faith, enforced lower wages growth in the public sector, and threats to the unemployed are policies designed to keep wages down – and they are working. Even in the midst of a pandemic, even with all other economic data going haywire, wages are behaving as expected – and that expectation is now terribly and permanently low."
2021-02-27T16:00:28Z,business,Business,Out of office: what the homeworking revolution means for our cities,"Susanna* has spent most of lockdown in back-to-back Zoom meetings. It is a major change for the senior banker, who used to commute to London from her home in rural Lincolnshire and regularly travelled across the country to meet business customers face to face. The 55-year-old does not miss the 5.30am alarms or spending three nights a week away from her husband and son. And she appreciates the way the bank’s management has banned calls between noon and 1pm – now dubbed “golden hour” – and cuts video meetings off after 50 minutes to give staff a brief buffer. But working from home has felt relentless, and after nearly a year she is longing to return to some sort of normality. Following the pandemic, Susanna is hoping for a middle ground where she can experience the buzz of central London and cross-country travel, while enjoying the extra downtime remote working permits. Her ideal scenario would be to meet her team of six just once a month in the office, and she would not be afraid to challenge bosses if they asked for more.
“Why would we need to do that,” she said, “with everything that we’ve proved over the past year in terms of how we’re able to conduct our business, and do it much quicker?” Susanna is not alone in her desire for more flexibility in her post-pandemic life. Indeed many analysts believe a shift to remote working was already under way, with coronavirus accelerating it by around a decade. Seven in 10 UK employees who have been working remotely during Covid-19 told a survey by Boston Consulting Group that they felt as productive at home as in the workplace. More than half (53%) of workers said they would prefer a hybrid model in future, splitting their time equally between their desk and a remote location. Boris Johnson provided little new guidance on managing the return to workplaces last Monday when he presented his roadmap out of lockdown, promising only to review the advice on working from home by late June. Most social restrictions are expected to be relaxed in midsummer, but businesses are not anticipating a large-scale recolonisation of offices before September, provided coronavirus case rates continue to decline. By then, office-based workers will have spent almost 18 months away from the watercooler, and few expect work to return to the way it was.
Some of the largest firms in the financial sector, for decades a bastion of an office-based corporate culture, seem ready to rethink the way things are done. They are also seizing the opportunity to cut costs by reducing the amount of office space they use. Banking group HSBC revealed last week that it was taking advantage of the booming popularity of home working by cutting its global office space by 40%. Its floor-space footprint looks set to shrink in London: the lender said it was committed to its headquarters in the Canary Wharf financial district, but may not renew leases for other sites in the capital. Competitor Lloyds followed with an announcement that it would slash its own desk numbers by a fifth over the next two years, following staff requests for home working to be made permanent. The issue of remote working has divided opinion within the financial sector, however, with the chief executive of Goldman Sachs calling the trend an aberration. Although the US bank has operated successfully while its staff remained at home, David Solomon said this did not represent “a new normal” because firms like Goldman Sachs required face-to-face contact to foster innovation and collaboration, and to train and guide the next generation.
It may be younger members of staff, including millennials, who demand flexibility from their employers, including those in the financial sector, said Anita Rai, head of employment at law firm JMW. “As a business you have to make yourself attractive,” she said, “and that is the challenge for some of these financial institutions which are saying they are not really fans of agile working, because a lot of the generation coming through will be more resistant to that.” Most firms are expected to embrace a hybrid model, which will be more difficult to implement and manage than having the entire workforce either at home or in the office. “It’s going to be very difficult if we have a complete free-for-all,” said Nick South, expert on the future of work at Boston Consulting Group (BCG). “You have to think about people’s families and needs, people’s preferences, the practicalities, the guardrails you want to provide. There is quite a co-ordination job needed to make this work, and that’s before you think what tech do we need where, and how we will redesign our space.” Another banker, Belinda*, is among those hoping to continue working remotely for at least half the week, from her home office in rural Devon. The mother-of-one, who is in her 40s, appreciates being able to spend time with her son as soon as she closes her laptop. Her life before the pandemic consisted of commuting to various city-centre offices run by her employer, a high-street lender. “I have been really impressed with how productive we can be without being together in a building,” she said. “But there are times, if I’m really honest, that I miss doing some creative thinking together.”
New ways of working will make new demands of managers and human resources teams, according to psychologist Prof Cary Cooper of Alliance Manchester Business School, who is also president of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). “You have to have line managers who can manage people, who can tolerate ambiguity,” Cooper said. “They will need social and interpersonal skills, to recognise when people aren’t coping well because they are working too much from home. But all this is doable.” During the pandemic, UK office workers have adopted remote working more readily than their European counterparts, according to several surveys from US bank Morgan Stanley’s Alphawise research unit. British employees also intend to request more days at home in future than those in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. It is not entirely clear why this should be, though the length of the average commute in the UK, especially in south-east England, could be a deciding factor, as well as the hours worked in the UK, which has a longer average working week than most European countries. The shift in the world of work will have lasting consequences, not just for organisations and their staff, but also for our city centres and the service businesses – including sandwich shops, coffee stands and dry cleaners – which before Covid relied on steady footfall from office workers. Those businesses may find town centres less attractive in future, said Catherine McGuinness, chair of policy and resources at the Corporation of London, the governing body of the Square Mile. “We are pretty confident about people wanting to keep their big headquarters,” she said. “I worry what this means for the smaller supporting businesses. We may see a shakeout from the centre to the areas where people are basing themselves for the other days. It’s inevitable, I suppose.” * Names have been changed Remote possibilities for big tech The speed with which Silicon Valley embraced Covid-enforced working from home as a permanent cultural shift made what is a challenging transition for many businesses look easy. In February last year, weeks before coronavirus had achieved official pandemic status and ahead of government-mandated emptying of offices, companies from Google to Twitter had told their employees to stay at home. As restrictions stretched into months, the need to adapt sparked a remote-working arms race between the digital giants, underpinned by the notion that more flexible employers are better employers. For tech companies with existing resilient, internet-based working practices in place, and employees familiar with chat groups and video calls, the initial switch was frictionless. In May, with most traditional companies still grappling with the logistics of remote working, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, proclaimed that employees would be allowed to work from home “forever” if they wished. Google and Facebook have followed, announcing a permanent extension to their remote-working policies. But while tech firms have been quick to adapt to a decentralised, distributed model, the shift has proved a surprising cultural upheaval. “[Tech companies] weren’t as far ahead as you might think with remote working before,” says Joseph Evans of UK-based Enders Analysis. “They had that image, but expectations at these companies, particularly in head office, were the same as in other sectors – to be present in the office. The pandemic changed that, and unquestionably companies such as Facebook have embraced the change.” Now that vaccinations look likely to allow a return to offices later this year, Silicon Valley companies are looking at “hybrid” models. Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is developing a model where staff work three days in the office for “collaboration” and two days from home. “No company at our scale has ever created a fully hybrid workforce model,” Pichai said in an email to staff in December. “It will be interesting to try.”
Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has said the pandemic is fuelling a geographical diversification away from Silicon Valley, with about half the company’s workforce probably working remotely over the next five to 10 years. “We are going to be the most forward-leaning company on remote work at our scale,” he said. But the flexibility does not stretch as far as some may wish. Alphabet’s model would require employees to live within commuting distance, and a fully remote option is reportedly off the table. And while the Facebook and Twitter plans open huge opportunities for those living outside Silicon Valley, the companies have said employees who choose to relocate to cheaper areas will take a pay cut. The moves have sparked a wider debate on localised pay rates across cities and regions. “All the tech companies have gone on a back and forth journey regarding remote working,” says Evans. “They are settling on the idea that it has worked better than hoped, but that fully distributed teams on a permanent basis isn’t an optimum situation. “There will be substantial remote working – Facebook in particular is excited about hiring from anywhere in the country, anywhere in the world – but none of them will be 100% any time soon.” Mark Sweney"
2021-02-27T08:00:19Z,business,Business,Can Oatly milk it? Oatmilk brand gears up for US stock market,"“Here comes the post milk generation” is the slogan emblazoned on the side of the electric trucks of the alt-milk brand Oatly. We will soon find out if that’s true as the Swedish oatmilk juggernaut heads towards a mega US stock exchange listing. The Swedish company said this week it had begun work on a flotation in New York which some analysts think could value the fast-growing business at as much as $10bn (£7.1bn). Oatly is following the money to the US where investors have poured cash into companies such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, which have helped plant-based nourishment enter the mainstream thanks to high-profile deals to supply McDonald’s and Burger King, respectively, with vegan burgers.
After the upheaval of the pandemic some business leaders think 2021 could be a watershed moment for plant-based foods. Oatly, with the might of the US private equity firm Blackstone behind it, perhaps thinks so too. The consumer trends are clear. In the UK, sales of plant-based foods broke through the £1bn sales barrier last year, with 13 million shoppers buying meat-free substitutes and alt-milk, according to the grocery market analysts Kantar. And despite the hardship of lockdown, nearly 600,000 people around the world attempted Veganuary, up from about 400,000 in 2020.
Unilever, the FTSE 100 company behind brands such as Hellmann’s and Marmite, now says expanding its vegan range is a top priority, with its chief executive, Alan Jope, describing plant-based foods as as an “inexorable” trend. “We are seeing in every single country in the world shift towards more plant-based diets, even in emerging markets,” said Jope who is pushing the company to turn out vegan versions of its well-known products, ranging from mayo to Magnum ice-creams. Morten Toft Bech, the founder of the Yorkshire-based Meatless Farm, which is one of the UK’s fastest-growing plant-based meat brands, says if a company wants to “make it big” it has to go to the US because of the “tremendous” valuations that businesses achieve there. Beyond Meat, which has had a rocky ride as a listed company, has a market value of $9bn, compared with $1.5bn when it listed almost two years ago. Meatless Farm’s sales are on course to hit £50m this year and Toft Bech hopes it too will become a “unicorn” – a City term used to describe young firms valued at more than $1bn – like Oatly. Food companies that crack the US can grow very fast, Toft Bech said. “A lot of the US investors I speak to about Meatless Farm are so focused on the US they hardly understand anything else, because they don’t need to. The US [alone] has enough sales to become a unicorn.” Toft Bech said the prize for alternative meat brands is 50 times bigger than for dairy, given a $1.2tn global meat market. “You don’t need to produce more than burgers and a few sausages like Beyond Meat are doing to be big,” he says. “It’s so humongous that even with 1%, you are a huge company.” US consumers spent about £1.6bn on plant-based milks in 2020, which was about 25% more than in 2019. In UK supermarkets, sales of plant milks have increased by 16% to £278m in the past year, according to the data firm Nielsen. Within that, oat milk sales more than doubled to £73m (although a reality check should be provided in the £3.5bn of cow’s milk sold).
Over the past decade Oatly’s chief executive, Toni Petersson, has given the company, which had spent several decades in the Swedish wilderness, a makeover which has managed to make oats appealing to under-40s trying to make sustainable food choices. When one first-time drinker said “it tastes like shit!” the company printed the view on its cartons to start a conversation. Petersson has also featured in Oatly’s ads, including standing alone in a field with a synthesiser, singing “Wow, no cow!” The company has also moved into yoghurts, spreads and ice-cream. Last summer, Oatly sold a 10th of the company to a group of investors that included Blackstone, Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z in a deal valuing the business at $2bn. The change in its ownership triggered a backlash from climate and political activists who object to the presence of Blackstone, headed by the Trump donor Stephen Schwarzman. An interesting road now lies ahead for Oatly as it is forced to toe an increasingly corporate line to raise the cash needed to build a global network of factories.
Emma Clifford, an analyst at the market researchers Mintel, says one barrier to the growth of plant-based foods is the price as they generally cost more than what they are trying to replace. However, with the pandemic fuelling a sustainability kick, she thinks the environmental benefits will “become an even more persuasive selling point”. Consumers have certainly got a taste for oat milk and as Oatly starts meeting potential shareholders it will become clear whether investors are thirsty too. The naysayers argue we are less than five years away from peak plant milk. While oat milk sales are booming, the demand for soy and almond milks has already plateaued in the UK. Petersson told the Guardian last year that oat milk was not a fad. “Ten years from now, when generation Z and millennials have the strongest spending power globally I don’t think anybody is going to say, ‘Why don’t we start consuming more animal-based products?’”"
2021-02-27T07:00:18Z,business,Business,Npower withdraws mobile app after hackers steal personal details,"Npower has permanently withdrawn its mobile app after hackers used it to access its customers’ personal details, including the sort codes and the last four digits of their bank accounts. The hack, which cybersecurity experts said left the firm’s customers “wide open to fraud”, is understood to have taken place around the start of February. The company declined to say how many of its gas and electricity customers are affected by the breach, but said it had contacted them. It’s the latest setback for Npower’s parent company E.ON which took it over in 2019 and has been migrating over what’s left of the 3.6 million customers it inherited. In December, E.ON was forced to apologise after it took January’s direct debits 11 days early, telling those affected that they will not get a refund until after Christmas. At the end of January, E.ON’s app – which lets customers access their accounts and input their latest readings – stopped working for about two weeks. Npower said on Friday that this was unrelated to its cyber-attack. Its app will not be reinstated, and customers must use the website to access their accounts, it said. “We identified suspicious cyber-activity affecting the Npower mobile app, where someone has accessed customer accounts using login data stolen from another website,” said an Npower spokeswoman. “We’ve contacted all affected customers to make them aware of the issue, encouraging them to get advice on how to prevent unauthorised access to their online account. We immediately locked any online accounts that were potentially affected. We also notified the Information Commissioner’s Office [ICO] and Action Fraud. Protecting customers’ security and data is our top priority.”
A cybersecurity expert, Ray Walsh of ProPrivacy saidthose who have used the app should immediately check their bank statements for unusual activity. “The breach included sort codes and the last four digits of customer bank account numbers, leaving them wide open to fraud. Hackers now have access to all the user credentials and passwords from the Npower app, which means that consumers must change the passwords of any accounts that use the same details. “The probability that consumers will also now receive phishing emails is high, so it is essential that consumers watch their inboxes carefully for any emails that coerce them into following links or ask for personal information,” he said."

The Dow Jones industrial average shed 1.5% by the closing bell, dropping by 469 points to 30,932. The broader S&P 500 index did better, down 0.5% or 18 points at 3,811. And the Nasdaq managed a modest recovery, finishing 72 points higher at 13,192. Thatâ€™s a gain of 0.56%, so only recovering a slice of Thursdayâ€™s 3.5% tumble.
But overall, it was a nervous day dominated by concerns about rising US bond yields, and worries about inflation. Reuters reports: â€œThereâ€™s no question that the path in rates today is higher,â€� said Andrew Mies, chief investment officer at 6 Meridian. Financials and energy shares, the best performing S&P sectors this month, slipped on Friday. Technology stocks rose and semiconductor stocks advanced. â€œThere are a few tailwinds for stocks that we shouldnâ€™t lose sight of,â€� Mies said, citing President Joe Bidenâ€™s $1.9 trillion economic aid package before Congress. The S&P 500 value index dropped while the growth index rose in a reversal of this monthâ€™s trend. And that really is all for today..."
2021-02-26T18:00:19Z,business,Business,Global stock markets drop as inflation fears prompt sell-off,"Global stock markets ended February deep in the red, as fears of higher inflation prompted a sell-off in government bonds and spread anxiety across financial markets. The UK’s FTSE 100 index fell 168 points to 6,483, a 2.5% drop – the biggest one-day fall in percentage terms since the end of October. The UK stock market suffered the heaviest losses in Europe, while Germany’s Dax fell 0.67%, France’s CAC slid 1.4%, Italy’s FTSE MiB shed 0.9% and Spain’s Ibex lost 1.1%. The Europe Stoxx 600 index tracking the biggest European companies fell 1.7% and is down 2.5% over the week as a whole. Energy companies, mining stocks and property firms were the worst-performing sectors in London. They would be hit hard if central bankers started moving away from ultra-low interest rates and tightened policy to fight inflation. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at the trading platform CMC Markets UK, also noted that weaker oil and copper prices prompted some end-of-week profit-taking on the likes of BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Anglo American and Antofagasta. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones shed 469 points, or 1.5%, to close at 30,932 points. The Nasdaq ended the day 72 points higher, or around 0.56%, after the technology index suffered the heaviest sell-off since October on Thursday when it fell 3.5%. Government bond prices dropped again, pushing up yields further. Five- and 10-year gilt yields rose to their highest level since March, after the Bank of England’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, warned that an inflationary “tiger” might be on the loose, which means that borrowing costs could be raised sooner than markets expect. In a speech entitled Inflation: A Tiger by the Tail?, he warned central bankers against becoming complacent about the risks posed by rising inflation. US Treasury yields have also surged on expectations of stronger economic growth and higher inflation in the wake of the $1.9tn fiscal stimulus package proposed by the president, Joe Biden.
Sterling has also been hit by the rush away from riskier assets. The pound fell 0.5% to $1.394 against the dollar, away from the near-three-year high of over $1.42 of earlier this week. Gold prices fell to an eight-month low, down 3%. Weak economic figures also fuelled the stock sell-off. US consumer sentiment hit a six-month low, according to the University of Michigan’s monthly healthcheck. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at the trading platform IG, said: “This is the most serious move to the downside in months; not since the see-saw movement of September and October have we seen such a serious drop [in stocks]. It is clear that very few investors are willing to step up and buy the dip, at least for the time being.”"
2021-02-26T17:17:23Z,business,Business,Amanda Staveley v Barclays: a financial defeat but a PR victory,"When Roger Jenkins hotfooted it out of one crunch meeting in his Mayfair home in the autumn of 2008 – and straight round the corner to another at the Dorchester hotel – Barclays’ then chairman of investment banking could hardly have imagined that the minutiae of those encounters would linger in anybody’s memory for long. The purpose and potential consequences of the meetings could not have appeared more simple and pressing, as the financial world was in a midst of genuine crisis that had just caused the collapse of Lehman Brothers on Wall Street. Either Jenkins’ efforts would help secure emergency funding to save Barclays and allow him and his colleagues to get back to the business of making money. Or his sales patter would fail and the bank – plus the £39m annual pay and bonuses he had enjoyed for the previous three years – were history. But, in the end, reality proved less binary. Barclays was saved when £6.5bn of emergency funding was secured from the parties being represented at the two meetings with Jenkins – Abu Dhabi in the guise of the high-profile financier Amanda Staveley and Qatar by Sheikh bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, the chairman of Qatar Holdings – but the circumstances of the deals gave rise to one of the larger legal claims in recent City memory. Last summer, Staveley sued Barclays for up to £1.5bn after her client, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, invested £3.25bn as part of the 2008 rescue deal. The businesswoman alleged that better, secret, terms were offered to the Qataris, and that Jenkins, whose nickname at the bank was “Big Dog”, had deceived her by promising that Abu Dhabi was getting the “same deal”. That deception had cost Staveley hundreds of millions of pounds, she claimed, as it meant her company PCP Capital Partners eventually had to pull out of the deal as a principal and settle for just £30m in gross advisory fees. Certainly such a huge legal claim raised eyebrows, both outside and inside the Square Mile, with Barclays describing the damages case as “opportunistic and speculative” and suggesting Staveley had exaggerated the level of her contacts in the Gulf and the importance of her role in the Barclays deal. The bank was proved partly correct. On Friday, Mr Justice David Waksman ruled Staveley had indeed been deceived by Jenkins as she claimed – and that “for the most part, her evidence was reliable” – but if that part of his judgment reads like a public relations victory, the meat of it is a resounding financial defeat for Staveley. Crucially, the judge concluded that Staveley had suffered no loss because she would never have been able to raise enough debt finance to complete the deal as a principal. Staveley has said she is considering an appeal.
Waksman said: “There was no real chance of such finance being obtained by PCP, or anything like it … Accordingly, PCP is not entitled to any of the damages it sought by reference to its primary claim. I also rejected its secondary claim to the effect that [an alternative deal would have been struck], with an estimated value according to PCP of some £365m. This meant that PCP’s claim as a whole must fail.” However, he added: “Not only were the ‘same deal’ … representations [by Jenkins to Staveley] false but they had been made by Mr Jenkins knowing that they were false, in other words he knew that [Staveley’s businesses] were not getting the same deal as the Qatari interests.” He added: “Mr Jenkins’ dishonesty was in reality always present from 23 October [the date of his meetings with Staveley and Hamad]. It did not really change once the fees had morphed into [different deals] because both were (at the very least) still part of the effective purchase price payable to the Qataris. The same goes for the [£2bn loan given by Barclays to Qatar at the time of the deal] … At no point did Mr Jenkins tell Ms Staveley that the position had changed … That in itself was dishonest.” If the judgment represents simultaneously a financial defeat and a qualified PR triumph for Staveley, the reverse is true for Barclays.
A Barclays spokesperson said: “We welcome the court’s decision to dismiss PCP’s claim in its entirety and award it no damages.” But the bank said nothing about the way in which Jenkins – and other senior Barclays executives – were criticised by the judge. Nor did it comment on the manner the bank had acted towards Staveley, who had played a role in saving the bank. Last June, former Barclays executive Stephen Jones resigned as boss of the banking lobby group UK Finance just weeks before his alleged sexist remarks about Staveley were due to be revealed in the case. During the 2008 negotiations with Staveley, Jones was recorded as saying to a Barclays colleague that the female financier was “thick as shit” and also commenting on the size of her breasts."
2021-02-26T13:52:41Z,business,Business,Sainsbury's and Argos workers to get pay rise and third Covid bonus,"Sainsbury’s and Argos workers are to receive a third pandemic bonus and a pay increase of more than 2% to match the real living wage outside London, as supermarket sales continue to boom during the high street lockdown. Minimum hourly pay for Argos workers outside London will rise from £9.00 to £9.50 from March, and from £9.30 to £9.50 for Sainsbury’s staff. Pay for Sainsbury’s staff in central London will rise from £9.90 to £10.10, still short of the independently calculated living wage of £10.85. Sainsbury’s, which has owned Argos since 2016, said staff working in stores, call centres and its delivery network would also be given a bonus worth 3% of pay, or about £530 for a full-time worker, after two bonus payments last year.
The bonuses come after a demanding year for supermarket staff, with stores much busier than usual because cafes, restaurants and many takeaways have been closed. Clodagh Moriarty, the retail and digital director at Sainsbury’s, said: “In the last 12 months our frontline colleagues have shown outstanding commitment to our customers. In recognition of everything they have achieved, we are giving them a pay rise, plus an additional one-off payment.” Unions, however, said they were disappointed. The shop workers union Usdaw, which represents about 40,000 Sainsbury’s and Argos workers, said the offer fell short of the the £10 an hour that Morrisons had already agreed to pay staff outside London from April. Dave Gill, Usdaw’s national officer, said the bonus would affect the payment of universal credit and working tax credits that many workers relied on, and that the company should instead have given staff “the proper pay rise they deserve”.
He said: “Over the last year, Sainsbury’s staff have worked throughout the pandemic to keep the nation fed, facing increased abuse from customers and worrying about catching Covid-19. As key workers delivering an essential service, they deserve much better than the additional 20p an hour on offer, particularly after only receiving a 1.3% increase last year. “The deal offers a higher increase for Argos workers of around 6%, which is welcome, but they also deserve better.” Unite, which represents 9,000 Sainsbury’s staff, said Morrisons had put its rival to shame. The union’s national officer, Bev Clarkson, described the pay rise as pathetic. “Over the last year, Sainsbury’s staff have risked their health to keep the nation fed. They kept Sainsbury’s coffers full as they did so, even as other businesses were going to the wall,” she said."
2021-02-26T13:03:17Z,business,Business,Amanda Staveley loses high court action against Barclays,"Businesswoman Amanda Staveley has lost a multi-million pound high court battle against Barclays despite the judge finding that the bank was “guilty of serious deceit” in the way it raised billions of emergency funding to avoid a UK government bailout during the financial crisis. Staveley had sued the bank after learning that it had offered her client Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, a worse deal than that it offered to Qatar when Barclays was seeking billions of fresh investment to keep it going during the 2008 banking crisis. Staveley’s private equity firm PCP Capital had claimed £830m in damages. Judge David Waksman ruled on Friday that “Barclays was guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation” but that Staveley’s PCP group was not entitled to damages. This was because even if Barclays had been honest, PCP would not have been able to raise enough money to finance the deal, he said. “While PCP has succeeded on liability, it has failed on causation and loss with the result that the overall claim fails,” Waksman said. “I can understand why this outcome will be a serious disappointment to PCP, especially after I have found Barclays to be guilty of serious deceit.” The judge described Staveley as “the driving force of PCP” and a “tough, clever and creative entrepreneur”. He dismissed Barclays claims that she was “guilty of ‘obvious embellishment and invention’.” “I do not accept that as a general characterisation… she was essentially an untruthful or unreliable witness,” Waksman said. “I thought that, for the most part, her evidence was reliable.” Staveley, who the court heard had been referred to by some bank executives as “dolly bird”, said she was considering an appeal. “In spite of Barclays’ efforts to question my character and credentials, the court has recognised my abilities as a businesswoman and the truth of my account of events,” she said after the verdict. “The judgment confirms what I have said from the outset and repeated in my evidence; a senior executive at Barclays repeatedly lied to me when seeking private investment in the bank during the 2008 financial crisis.” “The evidence at trial was clear and unequivocal; [her private equity firm PCP Capital] was an investor in the transaction and played an integral role in the capital raising, which ultimately prevented the bank from being nationalised. “I will be taking advice on appealing the judge’s decision not to award damages.” Her lawyer said he hoped “regulators will have a close look at this judgment and the conclusions the judge reaches on the behaviour of senior personnel within Barclays”. A Barclays spokesperson said: “We welcome the court’s decision to dismiss PCP’s claim in its entirety and award it no damages.” Waksman criticised senior Barclays executives for their behaviour in negotiating the deal. He said Roger Jenkins, who was head of Barclays’ Middle East operations and led the discussions with PCP, was “prepared to be dishonest” and said parts of his evidence to the court were “clearly unsatisfactory and implausible”. “In my judgment, Mr Jenkins knew perfectly well that PCP was not getting the same deal in the required sense,” Waksman said. Jenkins was one Britain’s best-paid bankers during the financial crisis and received a £50m pay-off in 2009 in addition to his £39m annual pay and bonuses. The judge also said John Varley, Barclays former chief executive, was “evasive” in his evidence. Barclays, one of the few British banks to avoid a bailout in 2008, escaped criminal charges over the 2008 fundraising in 2018 and three former executives – including Jenkins – were cleared of fraud last year in a case brought by the Serious Fraud Office.
PCP, which led Abu Dhabi’s £3.25bn investment into the bank, alleged that Barclays paid Qatar £346m in hidden fees to secure its invest in the bank. Barclays denied the allegations and said it had struck separate, commercial agreements with Qatar and that PCP’s case was “wrong at every stage”."
2021-02-26T13:03:08Z,business,Business,German sandal maker Birkenstock taken over by LVMH-backed group,"The French family behind Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior is to take control of the German sandal maker Birkenstock in a deal thought to be worth €4bn (£3.5bn). Financière Agache, the family investment firm of Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire who controls the designer brand conglomerate LVMH, and L Catterton, a private equity firm part-owned by LVMH, has bought a majority stake in the family-owned footwear brand. The value of the deal has yet to be confirmed. Arnault fought off a competing bid from the private equity group CVC Capital Partners, which owns dozens of companies including Moto motorway services and the luxury watchmaker Breitling. Birkenstock said the investment would help it expand in China and India, and fund the development of its website and the expansion of its main German factory in Görlitz. Founded in 1774 in Langen-Bergheim by Johann Adam Birkenstock, a cobbler, the company set up its first factory in 1925. It will remain partly owned by the descendants of its founder – the brothers Alex and Christian Birkenstock – who will continue to oversee production of its footwear in Germany. Arnault’s experience in taking brands to Asia, and L Catterton’s ownership of fashion brands such as Ganni, Seafolly and Pepe Jeans are thought to have swung the bid in their favour. Christian and Alex Birkenstock said: “For the next 250 years we need partners sharing the same strategic and long-term vision as the Birkenstock family. In L Catterton and Financière Agache, we have found those partners. They bring both a deep understanding of the details of a manufacturing business that is all about quality and a respect for brands with a long heritage like ours. We look forward to taking the next steps with our partners and carrying our family business into an even brighter future.” Arnault said his investment would help the sandal maker “fully realise its significant growth potential”, adding: “Birkenstock was founded nearly 250 years ago and has grown to become one of the few iconic brands in the footwear industry. We truly appreciate brands with this long heritage.”
Interest in comfortable heritage brands has soared during the coronavirus pandemic, helping the bootmaker Dr Martens to launch on the London stock market with a valuation of £3.7bn last month. Sandal makers Crocs and Tevas, and the bootmaker Ugg have also enjoyed booming sales as the world switched to working from home and took to outdoor walks. Birkenstock’s sales increased 11% to €721.5m in 2019, when almost 24m pairs of its sandals were sold worldwide. The brand’s sales are thought to have surged again in 2020 as its footwear became a lockdown hit in many countries, including the UK. Luca Solca, a luxury goods analyst at the investment management firm Bernstein, said the investment in Birkenstock was in sync with the direction of the footwear and fashion market. He said the deal followed on logically from the Dr Martens flotation and the private equity firm Permira’s €1.3bn buyout of the Italian trainer brand Golden Goose. “Previously the focus was on elegant footwear like Jimmy Choo but the pandemic has accelerated a structural shift that was already moving towards casual and informal being the preferred option for consumers. This is not just in footwear but also other areas as well,” Solca said."
2021-02-26T12:43:18Z,business,Business,"Rates may have to rise sooner to tame inflation threat, says Bank economist","Central bank complacency risks letting the “inflation tiger” out of the bag, a senior Bank of England policymaker has said. Adding to market jitters about the resurgence of price pressures as the global economy recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic, Andy Haldane said borrowing costs could need to go up sooner than the City expected to tame the inflationary threat. Threadneedle Street’s chief economist – who has been the most optimistic of the nine members of the Bank’s rate-setting monetary policy committee – said the low-inflation era of the past few decades may be coming to an end. Other MPC members believe rising unemployment and business failures will ensure that inflation remains close to its official 2% target in the coming years, but Haldane said a smaller workforce, the retreat from globalisation, the stimulus provided by central banks, and the boost to consumer spending generated by running down savings would combine to push up the cost of living. “Inflation is the tiger whose tail central banks control,” Haldane said in a speech. “This tiger has been stirred by the extraordinary events and policy actions of the past 12 months. It is possible that, as vaccinations are rolled out and some degree of normality returns, inflation will return to a stable state of rest. Indeed, if risks from the virus or elsewhere prove more persistent than expected, disinflationary forces could return. “But for me there is a tangible risk inflation proves more difficult to tame, requiring monetary policymakers to act more assertively than is currently priced into financial markets. People are right to caution about the risks of central banks acting too conservatively by tightening policy prematurely. But for me the greater risk at present is of central bank complacency allowing the inflationary big cat out of the bag.”
Interest rates – or yields – on government bonds have risen this week as investors have demanded greater insurance against the risk of inflation. Haldane recently said in a newspaper article that the economy was like a “coiled spring” ready to go off, and his comment that the risks to inflation were skewed to the upside pushed the pound higher on the currency markets. He said there were “good grounds” for believing future inflation could behave very differently than in the past. The MPC’s collective position is that policy will not be tightened until there is clear evidence that the economy has made up the ground lost during the pandemic and the inflation target has been sustainably met. Haldane said: “My judgment is that we might see a sharper and more sustained rise in UK inflation than expected, potentially overshooting its target for a more sustained period, as resurgent demand bumps up against constrained supply.” Financial markets globally had recently begun pricing in this possibility, he added. Also speaking on Friday, the Bank of England deputy governor, Dave Ramsden, said the risks to UK inflation were broadly balanced. “When I look at the UK, I see inflation expectations – whatever measure you look at – well-anchored,” he said, following a speech to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales."
2021-02-26T12:32:52Z,business,Business,UK urged to change stock market rules to boost fintech sector post-Brexit,"The government has been urged to set up a £1bn startup investment fund, introduce special fast-track visas to draw global talent and change the UK’s stock market listing rules to protect and grow Britain’s financial technology sector post-Brexit. The recommendations are made in a report commissioned by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, that warns that growing overseas competition and Brexit uncertainty, including the more complex issue of hiring talent from Europe, is threatening the UK’s position as a leader in the fintech sector. The 108-page report by the former WorldPay chief executive Ron Kalifa calls for changes to UK stock market listing rules to stop fintech companies being lured to float in bases such as New York, Paris or Frankfurt. Changes could include introducing dual-class share structures, which give founders more control over their business after an initial public offering (IPO), and dropping the minimum number of shares that must be made available to 10%. The report found that out of 3,787 IPOs on the world’s major stock markets between 2015 and 2020, the UK accounted for just 4.5%. “IPOs are thriving globally, driven in part by tech companies that have become indispensable to both consumers and businesses in search of digital tools amid the coronavirus pandemic, and it is important the UK seizes this opportunity,” said Kalifa.
Britain has a 10% share of the global fintech market, generating about £11bn in revenues, and is home to success stories including Revolut, Monzo, Starling Bank and Wise, formerly TransferWise. Other recommendations include launching a new privately financed £1bn “fintech growth fund”, creating a new visa “stream” to more easily allow access to global talent, and setting up a “scalebox” to support fintech firms to grow. Sunak, who could unveil support for some of the recommendations in his budget next week, said: “We must now build on our global reparation for fostering innovative startups and ensure firms can access the talent, finance and support they need to scale up here in the UK. This review will make an important contribution to our plan to retain the UK’s fintech crown.”"
2021-02-26T08:12:44Z,business,Business,British Airways owner IAG hit by record €7.4bn loss ,"The owner of British Airways, International Airlines Group, reported a record €7.4bn loss for last year, and called for the introduction of digital health passes for passengers to enable the airline industry to get back on its feet. IAG said that passenger capacity last year was only a third of 2019 and in the first quarter of this year is running at only a fifth of pre-Covid levels. The airline group reported a total annual operating loss of €7.4bn (£6.4bn), including expensive fuel and currency hedges, retiring its planes early and the costs of its 10,000 staff redundancies – a €10bn swing in a year from its €2.6bn profit in 2019.
“Our results reflect the serious impact that Covid-19 has had on our business,” said Luis Gallego, the chief executive of IAG. “The group continues to reduce its cost base and increase the proportion of variable costs to better match market demand. We’re transforming our business to ensure we emerge in a stronger competitive position.” IAG’s passenger revenues plunged by 75% from €22.4bn to €5.5bn last year but it said its cargo business had “helped to make long-haul passenger flights viable” during the pandemic. Cargo revenues increased by almost €200m to €1.3bn and IAG also operated more than 4,000 cargo-only flights during the year. The airline group said that because of the uncertainty over the impact of the pandemic on its business, it would not provide profit guidance for this year and called for an international plan to “reopen the skies”. Gallego said: “The aviation industry stands with governments in putting public health at the top of the agenda. Getting people travelling again will require a clear roadmap for unwinding current restrictions when the time is right. We know there is pent-up demand for travel and people want to fly. Vaccinations are progressing well and global infections are going in the right direction. We’re calling for international common testing standards and the introduction of digital health passes to reopen our skies safely.” Despite the record loss, shares in IAG were up 3.5% on Friday afternoon, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100. BA has been conducting a trial for a VeriFLY digital health passport and is also in discussions with the International Air Transport Association on its Travel Pass, which it hopes to roll out worldwide after trials in Australia and New Zealand. Sean Doyle, the chief executive of BA, said: “We’re keen to work with the government to set a policy framework to verify whatever is required to travel – proof of vaccinations or a negative test. “With the momentum we see on bookings for the summer and the demand out there, this could be a very important part of opening up this summer.” Doyle said there had been a “strong intake” of leisure and short-haul bookings since Monday, when the UK prime minister set out the first possible travel dates for England. Although many in the industry are pessimistic about the future of long-haul flying, Doyle added: “We’ve very confident of a high-level of pent-up demand. The long-haul business, the visiting friends and relatives traffic supported by cargo, made long-haul a larger proportion of flying than short-haul in the last couple of months – it has unique characteristics that keep it relevant and keep it viable for us.”
He said that business travel would take longer than leisure trips but would recover demand: “We know from surveys there’s growing frustration from exclusively working from home and people want to get out and do business face to face.” IAG burned through €4.1bn in cash last year – almost €80m a week. Despite this, the company said its liquidity stood at €10.3bn, higher than at the start of the pandemic. IAG’s market value has halved to £9.6bn since the start of the pandemic. “These results from IAG really do bring out just how painful the last year has been for the airline industry,” said Jack Winchester, an analyst at Third Bridge. “Investors have been willing to plug IAG’s finances on the assumption of an eventual recovery but when the dust settles we are likely to see that low-cost carriers like Ryanair and Wizz Air have come out of 2020 in far better shape.”"
2021-02-26T07:30:09Z,business,Business,Airbus reveals planes sold in last two years will emit over 1bn tonnes of CO2,"Planes sold by Airbus in 2019 and 2020 will produce well over 1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide during their lifetimes, according to landmark first estimates of the aerospace manufacturer’s emissions. Airbus sold a record 863 planes in 2019, which would translate to 740m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent produced over a 22-year period, according to figures seen by the Guardian. It sold 566 planes last year, for which lifetime emissions would be 440m tonnes. The figures highlight the scale of the challenge of decarbonisation for the plane-making duopoly of Airbus and its US rival Boeing. Aviation accounts for about 1.9% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and this share is expected to rise rapidly as more people in poorer nations are able to afford to fly. The emissions intensity of Airbus products fell from 66.6g of CO2 equivalent per passenger kilometre in 2019 to 63.5g in 2020. Airbus, which has factories in France, the UK, US and China, said this reflected more efficient planes even as the pandemic caused sales to fall. Julie Kitcher, a member of Airbus’s executive committee who oversees sustainability and communications, said: “Despite the crisis, we’re accelerating the roadmap to decarbonising aviation.” She said the disclosures were a worst-case view of potential emissions because sustainable fuels could cut the planes’ true net emissions. The independently audited disclosures mark the first time Airbus has published an estimate of the carbon emissions its commercial planes will generate. These are part of what are known as scope 3 emissions, as opposed to direct emissions from company machinery (scope 1) or emissions embedded in purchased energy (scope 2). The scope 3 disclosures come as scrutiny of the company’s emissions by the public, governments and investors increases. They will put pressure on Boeing to reveal its emissions. Emissions disclosure is seen as an important first step in the long journey towards a net zero economy, but Airbus said it had not yet set a science-based target for cutting its carbon emissions. The aviation industry has a non-binding target to reach net zero between 2060 and 2065, long after the 2050 deadline that scientists say is required to limit global heating to only 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Airbus, Boeing, and engine manufacturers such as the UK’s Rolls-Royce are working on zero-emissions propulsion, as are a crowd of much smaller rivals. Some smaller electric planes are nearing production and Airbus is hoping to launch its first hydrogen-powered planes by 2035. Zero-emissions technology for long-haul flights is far off.
Airbus has reduced its emissions per passenger kilometre by half since 1990 through better aerodynamics, more efficient engines and lighter, stronger materials. However, further cuts in emissions will be more difficult to achieve. Kitcher acknowledged that Airbus’s plans to cut emissions would depend heavily on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), synthesised kerosene produced from replenishable resources. SAF would still emit similar amounts of CO2 but would theoretically cause net-zero emissions over its lifecycle. About half of Airbus’s plan for net zero emissions by 2050 depends on SAF, 42% from new technologies and the rest from more efficient management of planes. Similarly, Boeing has committed to certifying all of its planes for 100% SAF use by 2030, after carrying out test flights.
Andrew Murphy, the aviation director at the campaign group Transport & Environment, welcomed the prospect of better aviation emissions disclosure. He said, however, that non-CO2 heating effects such as those caused by aircraft contrails should also be reported. Non-CO2 effects heat the planet more than carbon, according to EU analysis. He also said SAF was potentially viable but it would take concerted action by governments and industry over the next decade to scale it sustainably to anywhere near the levels required. The slow action meant the aviation industry was likely to rely heavily on carbon offsetting for the next decade, he said. “The sector is in kind of a bind,” he said. “The only thing the sector can do for the next 10 years is mitigate its growth.”"
2021-02-26T07:01:09Z,business,Business,Kerbside scheme to cut electronic waste could be launched in UK,"The UK government is considering nationwide kerbside collection of used electrical appliances and gadgets to help improve the recycling of electronic waste. Local councils in some areas already collect broken washing machines and toasters in schemes funded by waste collection fees that all retailers selling electrical goods must pay. The government is consulting on the best way to implement such schemes across the country and how to fund them. In a response to parliament’s environmental audit committee report on e-waste, the government said it was also considering new measures that would increase the obligation for online marketplaces and retailers, such as Amazon, to take back unwanted or broken electrical goods. The government also said it was considering forcing companies to improve labelling on products to make clear how easy it was to repair an item and whether it contained recyclable parts. Under rules in place since 2014, those selling more than 5 tonnes of electronic and electrical equipment each year must finance the costs of collection, treatment, recovery and recycling of those materials when they become waste.
Retailers can do this by paying fees to local authorities to process electrical goods brought back to council-run waste recycling centres, or organising the collection of old items from homes when delivering new goods. Since January, retailers with stores have also had to enable customers to bring unwanted goods back to their outlets. Online sellers and marketplaces are not obligated to take back items themselves, which is more convenient for some shoppers and potentially more costly. Currently they only have to pay fees to help fund council waste centres. MPs say this system is not working as there is too much uncollected or incorrectly collected electronic waste.
Philip Dunne MP, the chair of the environmental audit committee, said: “Levelling the playing field for online giants and physical retailers in the take-back of e-waste is important if we are to cut down on the amount of e-waste disposed of incorrectly. “We need to make urgent improvements to the reuse and recycling of such products, and I am pleased that the government has recognised the role online retailers and marketplaces should play in taking increased responsibility for the e-waste streams they help generate.” A spokesman for Amazon said it had “supported” the recycling of 10,000 tonnes of electronic waste in the UK over the past decade and that it would continue working with the government to tackle the problem “Amazon is committed to minimising waste and helping our customers to reuse, repair and recycle their products. We provide easy ways for customers to recycle electronics through pre-paid postal return and home collection services on our Amazon Recycling website,” the spokesman said."
2021-02-26T04:25:28Z,business,Business,Australia considers approving Pfizer Covid vaccine for standard cold storage ,"Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine could soon be delivered at temperatures 50 degrees warmer than currently required if Australia follows the US’s lead to ease the rollout. The potential change in storage temperature requirements is being considered as the federal health department confirmed that 25 Pfizer vaccine vials – at least 125 doses - were spoiled at St Vincent’s care services in Werribee because it was not possible to verify their temperature had been maintained. The US Food and Drug Administration has announced it will allow the vaccines to be transported and stored at conventional pharmaceutical freezer temperatures for a period of up to two weeks.
The move follows Pfizer and BioNTech notifying the FDA the vaccine is stable and effective if stored for two weeks at -15C to -25C. On Friday a Pfizer spokesperson told Guardian Australia it will submit the same data to other regulators including Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration in coming weeks. If approved by the TGA, that could lead to a relaxation of the current requirement that Pfizer vaccines must be kept at -70C, which limits distribution to centralised hubs and makes it unlikely people in remote areas will be given Pfizer vaccines. A spokesperson for Pfizer said “if approved by regulators such as the … TGA, the new storage option could offer vaccination centres greater flexibility in managing and maintaining vaccine distribution and supply”. “No changes have been made to the vaccine to enable this potential storage change. “The new storage condition is the result of ongoing stability studies being conducted at a variety of temperature ranges.” According to Pfizer’s data, vaccine quality remains within specifications after storage for two weeks at -15C to -25C and for six months at -60C to -80C. “Frozen conditions ensure the RNA and lipid nanoparticle are within specifications.”
Scott Morrison told reporters in Sydney the approval in the US for Pfizer in standard cold storage was “potentially exciting news” . “Our contract with Pfizer includes dealing with cold chain logistics and delivery of those doses. [Pfizer] are saying that can now be done at a [pharmaceutical] refrigerator temperature.” Morrison said the health minister Greg Hunt had been in touch with the head of the TGA John Skerritt to consider the new information at the “earliest opportunity”. Morrison said that “new information” is always welcome to help learn from new science to refine the rollout, but noted that Australia would only move forward with TGA approval. Earlier, the ABC reported that the federal health department was assessing whether 25 vials of Pfizer vaccine that were thawed and refrigerated at a Werribee aged care centre have been spoiled. In a statement, the health department said Aspen Healthcare had reported there were 25 unused vaccine vials in an on-site refrigerator after it conducted vaccinations at St Vincent’s, an aged care centre in Werribee, on Wednesday. “The Pfizer vaccine can be stored in a refrigerator at 2-8C for up to five days,” it said. “While refrigeration was maintained it was not possible to verify that temperature was maintained throughout. “Therefore, out of an abundance of caution, a medical decision was made not to use the remaining vials.” The health department thanked “the Aspen Healthcare worker who responded resourcefully and took action to ensure both use of the vaccines” – implying that some surplus vaccines were salvaged – and the “protection of the integrity of the unused vials”. “This represents 0.15% of week 1 doses distributed and the loss rate has been far lower than expected and assumed which is a tribute to all involved.”
Earlier, Morrison dodged a question about what he knows about the reported potential waste of vaccine doses in Werribee, choosing instead to discuss the progress of the rollout generally. Morrison said after four full days of the rollout, more than 90 aged care facilities, 6,500 people in aged care and a total of 23,000 Australians had received vaccinations. “In the early days where there are logistical difficulties ... they’re worked through,” he said, noting that two patients who received four times the recommended dose of Pfizer vaccine are both well. “Where things are learned in the early phase of the rollout, they will be applied.”"
2021-02-26T00:01:01Z,business,Business,Thames Water hopes to harness human 'poo power' to heat homes,"Thousands of homes in south-west London could soon be warmed by the waste from their local sewage works as part of England’s first poo-powered district heating scheme. Thames Water hopes to harness the heat of human waste from its treatment plant in Kingston upon Thames to warm more than 2,000 new homes that form part of a regeneration plan for the borough’s Cambridge Road estate. Typically, the water company flushes the clean warm water that remains after it has treated its customers’ sewage back into a local river system as effluent. But under the new plan it will funnel the warm water to an energy centre where the effluent will help heat the water destined to warm local homes. The new Thames Water energy centre will use heat pumps to boost the temperature of the water higher, and heat exchangers to transfer the heat of the waste water to a separate system of water pipes which will carry hot water to the district heating scheme. Caroline Kerr, the leader of Kingston council, described the scheme to turn waste into clean energy as a “groundbreaking” step to help make the homes on the Kingston estate some of the greenest in the country. By using renewable poo-powered heating in place of fossil fuel gas, the scheme could save 105,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over 30 years, according to Thames, the equivalent of 157,000 return flights from London to New York or more than 15,000 car journeys around the world. “It’s a first for England and shows we are serious about reducing carbon in the borough. This is a real opportunity to be bold and ambitious for future generations,” she said. The district heating scheme could be expanded so that public and commercial buildings in Kingston town centre also feel the warmth of human waste. Sarah Bentley, the new chief executive of Thames Water, said the renewable heat from the water company’s sewer network is “a fantastic resource, so it’s vital we are a leading player in energy transition and unlock the full potential of ‘poo power’.” She said she was confident that the Kingston project could help unlock the heating potential of sewage across the country as the government prepares to ban gas boilers in new housing developments from 2025. The UK’s first district heating scheme to be warmed by human waste was set up in 2015 by Scottish Water to provide 95% of the heat required by Borders College in Galashiels."

Wall Street has closed, with heavy losses across the board as the jump in government bond yields give the markets a jolt. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 559 points lower at 31,402, a drop of 1.75%. The broader S&P 500 index fell nearly 2.5%. The Nasdaq suffered a nasty plunge, shedding 3.5%, as technology shares shares bore the brunt of the selloff. Thatâ€™s the Nasdaqâ€™s biggest fall since last October, with investors favouring into companies that would benefit from a broad economic recovery this year (such as energy firms and miners, which rallied in London today). Reuters explains how the jump in government bond yields worried Wall Street: Wall Streetâ€™s main indexes ended sharply lower on Thursday, with the Nasdaq index posting its largest daily percentage fall in four months, as technology-related stocks remained under pressure following a rise in U.S. bond yields. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yields hit a one-year high of 1.614%, prompting investors concerned about rich valuations to lock in profits on some high-flying growth stocks. The Treasury note yield rose above S&P 500 dividend yield, wiping out the stock market yieldâ€™s strong advantage. â€œRates matter. At 1.5%, the yield is comparable to S&P 500 dividend yield,â€� said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. â€œAnd thereâ€™s no capital risk with a 10-year, youâ€™ll get your principal back. All of a sudden itâ€™s competitive with stocks,â€�
CNBC agrees that the jump in US government bond yields, to a one-year high, spooked investors: Itâ€™s â€œjust a full on rout in the bond market. So that filters into everything else,â€� said Evercore ISI strategist Dennis DeBusschere. â€œIt looks like we just had a flash move in bonds. With a puke move that drove [10-year] yields to 1.6%... We just have to wait for some form of equilibrium in bonds.â€� The jump also put the benchmark rate above the S&P 500â€²s dividend yield, meaning that equities â€” which are considered riskier assets â€” have lost their premium over bonds. The milestone could exacerbate the move out of stocks as they become less attractive.
The speed and scale of the jump in bond yields has certainly surprised the markets and suggests that investors are positioning for US interest rates to rise sooner than thought (although the Fed has been trying to dampen such talk). The FT says: â€œThis rate move has caught a lot of these accounts off guard,â€� Tom di Galoma, a managing director at Seaport Global Holdings, said, referring to hedge funds and buyers of mortgage-backed securities. â€œWeâ€™ve had a sell-off globally. Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and most of Europe have all felt this pain. But I think it is coming mostly from hedging. I donâ€™t think there are people bailing on positions.â€� More here: Wall Street stocks sell off as government bond rout accelerates Goodnight! GW"
2021-02-25T20:01:05Z,business,Business,Labour calls Serco's decision to pay millions to investors 'outrageous',"The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has criticised Serco’s decision to hand investors millions in dividends after enjoying a bumper year boosted by its £350m contract to run the heavily criticised NHS Covid-19 test-and-trace programme. The outsourcing giant has announced it is to resume dividend payouts after a seven-year interval, with a £17m distribution, following a pandemic year in which profits almost doubled. Following publication of Serco’s annual results on Thursday, Starmer tweeted: “Outrageous. Taxpayers’ money shouldn’t be given to Serco’s shareholders via dividends.” Thanks to a series of government contracts, Serco runs a quarter of testing sites across the UK and provides call handlers for the NHS’s contact-tracing programme. “The government should have placed test and trace in the hands of our NHS and local communities,” Starmer added.
Serco played down the impact of pandemic contracts on its results, saying the work accounted for just 1% of underlying profits. It reported pre-tax profits of £153m last year, up from £80.7m in 2019, as revenues surged by a fifth to £3.9bn. Rupert Soames, Serco’s chief executive, said the board had thought carefully about reinstating a dividend “in light of the current circumstances”. He said it was the right thing to do for investors, given that Serco had repaid all government employment and financial support and awarded a £100-a-person bonus to 50,000 frontline staff in recognition of the “intense pressure and extra work” during the pandemic. “Dividends should normally be paid by companies – dividends, after all, are what pay people’s pensions,” Soames told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “It is fair that shareholders who over the last five years have come to the rescue of Serco and put in £800m of equity should be allowed a dividend.”
Soames defended the test-and-trace scheme, saying that while it had endured a “bumpy start”, such a system had “never been done before in the UK”. He said: “As of last week, there are as many people being tested every week as we’ve vaccinated – about 2.5 million people a week. In the first week of January there were about 1 million people who were traced through the system.” Serco’s share price rose by more than 4% following the publication of its annual results. It is one of five companies running Covid-19 testing sites. Last week it emerged that almost 4,000 Amazon workers were given the wrong coronavirus test results after a mistake by test and trace. Concerns have also been raised by some healthcare professionals about the use of outsourced, inexperienced call centre staff in roles better suited to clinically trained experts. Last week Serco announced it was expanding its defence business, buying the contractor Whitney, Bradley and Brown, which has clients including the US air force, for £212m."
2021-02-25T19:47:45Z,business,Business,AstraZeneca and Moderna’s contrasting rewards for fighting Covid hardly seem fair,"Compare and contrast. AstraZeneca is currently producing Covid vaccines for no profit and still manages to get beaten up by opportunists in Brussels. Over in the US, Moderna is hailed as a national saviour while shouting from the rooftops about how its commercial prospects have been transformed by its own Covid vaccine. Moderna’s full-year statement on Thursday was extraordinary. The company expects to generate revenues of $18.4bn (£13.1bn) this year from deals it has signed to supply its vaccine, which is priced at $30–$36 a shot, so is definitely intended to produce a chunky profit margin. That revenue forecast is enormous. For comparison, AstraZeneca’s entire established portfolio – for cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory treatments and more – generated sales of $26.6bn last year. The backstories to the vaccines are very different, of course. Moderna was a loss-making biotechnology firm that has poured billions into developing messenger RNA technology (also used in the BioNtech/Pfizer product) and a successful return on that investment was never guaranteed. AstraZeneca has merely accelerated original research done at Oxford University – and a condition of the partnership was “at cost” pricing for all the deals to date. There is a consolation for AstraZeneca in that it backed Moderna in its early years and now owns a stake in the company worth roughly $5bn. All the same, the contrasting rewards from combating the pandemic hardly seem fair. AstraZeneca may be able to switch to commercial pricing for higher-income countries eventually, but its only gain so far has been goodwill, although not from all in the EU. In a (still) undersupplied Covid vaccine market in 2021, Moderna can expect to make an absolute mint. Centrica’s disgruntled shareholders have one reason to be cheerful “Significant uncertainties” remain at Centrica, the owner of British Gas, says its chief executive, Chris O’Shea, and he didn’t just mean the industrial dispute over so-called “fire and rehire” contracts. A turnaround “won’t be easy” and, though he’s confident it will happen, he’s not saying when – “the coming years”. With vagueness on this scale, you can understand why the shares slid 3%. British Gas lost more customers in 2020, albeit less rapidly than usual, and the timing of the two big disposals – the Spirit Energy upstream production business and the stake in the nuclear generator British Energy – are anybody’s guess. There is, though, one comfort for Centrica’s long-suffering shareholders. O’Shea is the first chief executive in years who sounds serious about making the business simpler and more competitive with the independents. He still has to make peace with the unions, but his predecessors seemed to think Centrica was some form of protected national energy champion. That illusion has now gone, thankfully. Indignation over Serco’s ‘Covid windfall’ is misplaced
Criticism over the NHS test-and-trace programme confirmed Serco’s place in popular corporate infamy, so the nation probably won’t rise to applaud the first dividend for shareholders since 2014. Fair enough. But one can also feel a smidgeon of sympathy for Rupert Soames, the chief executive, as he tried to deflect the idea that the distribution is some sort of Covid windfall. It’s definitely not that. First, Covid has been only slightly better than neutral for Serco. The test-and-trace work brought in revenues of £350m in 2020, which, at a 4% margin, generated operating profits of £14m. But, on the other side of the ledger, the company says contracts to run leisure centres and suchlike evaporated. The net gain was a mere £2m. Second, Serco has repaid its Covid support in the UK. Axing dividends a year ago, amid the initial financial confusion created by the pandemic, was the correct approach, but the exit from support schemes is roughly the moment when dividend life should be allowed to resume. In any case, the cash cost of Serco’s dividend is £17m – hardly a bonanza for a company that was rescued, in effect, by the infusion of £850m from investors since 2014. Indignation is better directed at the miscreants on business rates: those retailers who kept their relief even as their stores were open and trading strongly. Is it nearing game over for GameStop’s investor frenzy? The second incarnation of the GameStop saga is even more baffling than the first. To recap: the share price doubled on Wednesday and kept going in early US trading on Thursday, even though fair value for the video games retailer is a lot lower, according to almost every independent analyst. Since the short-selling hedge funds are now off the pitch, the latest larks can’t be explained by a technical short squeeze. Rather, it seems to be a case of buyers piling in just because the share price rose again. Some will have made money, of course. But surely everybody now knows what’s coming next."
2021-02-25T18:14:03Z,business,Business,Moderna forecasts $18bn in sales of Covid vaccine this year,"Moderna expects to rake in $18.4bn (£13bn) of sales from its coronavirus vaccine this year, marking a huge turnaround in the fortunes of the US biotech firm. The expected revenue is far higher than the $11.2bn predicted by analysts, and exceeds the $15bn in sales that its US rival Pfizer expects for the Covid-19 vaccine that it developed with Germany’s BioNTech. Massachusetts-based Moderna, founded 11 years ago, said the final number could even exceed the $18.4bn its current deals would bring in, as it was in discussions with several governments about further orders. It is also in talks with Covax, a mechanism created to distribute Covid vaccine doses fairly around the world. The vast sales will push Moderna into profit for the first time and move the company into a bigger league. The UK’s AstraZeneca had sales of $25bn last year, but while AZ employs 70,000 staff, Moderna had just 830 in 2019. Moderna charges $30 for the required two shots in the US and $36 in the EU. By comparison, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine costs $39 for two doses in the US and just under $30 in the EU. The AstraZeneca vaccine ranges from $4.30 to $10 for two doses, and the company had pledged not to profit from the vaccine until the pandemic is declared over. The Moderna vaccine, similar to the Pfizer/BioNTech version, is based on re-engineering mRNA – the molecule that sends genetic instructions from DNA to a cell’s protein-making machinery – and it has produced equally strong results in late-stage clinical trials, with an efficacy of 94%. Moderna is the first company to have developed a new vaccine version designed to provide better protection against the highly contagious coronavirus variant identified in South Africa, and it shipped it to the US National Institutes of Health this week for testing as a booster shot. Stéphane Bancel, the chief executive of Moderna, said 2021 would be “an inflection year” for the business. The 48-year-old Frenchman has been at the helm of Moderna since 2011. The company floated in 2018 but the share price languished around the flotation price until coronavirus emerged. In the last 12 months, the price has soared from around $19 to $155, giving the company a value of around $60bn. That surge has turned Bancel, who has a 9% stake in Moderna, into a paper billionaire worth more than $5bn. The firm opened subsidiaries in eight countries last year and plans to add Japan, South Korea and Australia in 2021. “We will advance our mission of delivering on the promise of mRNA science to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients,” Bancel said. “This is just the beginning.” Moderna was founded in 2010 by a stem cell biologist, Derrick Rossi, and two financial backers, with the idea that mRNA could be re-engineered to develop drugs and vaccines. It has 23 other mRNA drugs and vaccines in its portfolio, such as vaccines for the viruses Zika, HIV and Nipah. But with the exception of the Covid-19 vaccine, none of its products have yet made it to market. The UK has ordered 17m shots of the Moderna vaccine, the first of which are expected to arrive in April. The EU has already received some Moderna jabs. Last week the EU ordered 150m additional doses from Moderna, for delivery from the summer, bringing its total order this year to 310m doses. It has the option to purchase a further 150m doses for delivery next year. Two weeks ago the US government purchased an additional 100m doses of the Moderna vaccine, taking its total to 300m doses. Moderna remains on track to deliver the first 100m doses by March and the second order of 100m doses in May. Japan has purchased 50m doses."
2021-02-25T16:36:12Z,business,Business,Future of Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port factory hangs in balance,"The owner of Vauxhall has claimed it is considering the closure of its Ellesmere Port factory unless the UK government offers financial support after extended negotiations. An executive of Stellantis, the carmaker, on Thursday said it hoped to reach a binding agreement with the government on aid. Michael Lohscheller, the head of Stellantis’s Opel and Vauxhall brands, said “at this stage these discussions are productive but not conclusive”, in an interview with Bloomberg News. A final decision may not be reached by the weekend, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. Lohscheller said he expected UK authorities to “behave in the interest of the UK economy”, but reportedly said a lack of government support may require closing the factory, a move that would put about 1,000 jobs at risk. Stellantis was formed this year in a merger between the Italian-American carmaker Fiat Chrysler and France’s Peugeot, which has owned Vauxhall since 2017. The latest investment decision has long loomed over the UK automotive sector as production of the current petrol and diesel Astra models nears its end. Stellantis was considering whether to build electric cars at the plant. The company had weighed up three options for the plant: building a new version of the Vauxhall/Opel Astra, constructing another model or winding it down. The government has been closely following the decision, which had been seen as a key test of the UK’s automotive prospects after Brexit and as the transition to electric vehicles accelerates. Stellantis management has had talks with the UK’s business secretary three times in the past six weeks, including a meeting with Kwasi Kwarteng as recently as Monday night. A government spokesperson said: “We are committed to ensuring the UK continues to be one of the best locations in the world for automotive manufacturing, and we are doing all we can to protect and create jobs, while securing a competitive future for the sector. “We regularly speak with all automotive companies, including Stellantis, but do not comment on ongoing discussions.” The Ellesmere Port plant had long been considered at risk, after Carlos Tavares, Stellantis’s chief executive, made it clear that the decision rested on the course of the Brexit deal. The deal that was finally agreed on Christmas Eve avoided disaster for Britain’s automotive sector, securing tariff-free trade in parts and cars between the UK and EU. In January, Tavares added further pressure on the UK government, describing the 2030 ban on pure petrol and diesel cars as “brutal” and saying that the plant’s future depended in part on government action. Tavares masterminded the 2017 purchase of the Vauxhall and Opel brands and factories from General Motors’ perennially loss-making European division. He rapidly turned the brands around to their first profit in 20 years in 2018, after a large-scale cost-cutting plan."
2021-02-25T16:30:32Z,business,Business,Renewable energy listed for first time as one of Australia's top infrastructure priorities,"Renewable energy zones and dispatchable energy storage have been listed as “high priority initiatives” by Infrastructure Australia for the first time. The energy initiatives are among 44 new infrastructure proposals on the priority list, released on Friday, which together represent a $59bn pipeline of potential investments. A number of projects on the list – which has been significantly influenced by the country’s changing needs since the Covid-19 pandemic – emphasise the importance of digitisation, decentralisation, localism, service innovation and adaptability.
They include enabling digital health services for regional and remote Australia and regional telecommunications transmission capacity, listed as high priority national initiatives. The Infrastructure Australia report said the national energy market (Nem) would require “significant new grid-scale, renewable energy generators to replace retiring thermal generation facilities”. It called for the expansion of existing renewable energy zones or the establishment of new zones for large-scale wind, solar and hydro. The Nem required “significant investments in dispatchable energy storage to support growing renewable energy generation and the future retirement of coal-fired generators”, Infrastructure Australia said. Dispatchable energy is power that can be dispatched on demand at the request of power grid operators, according to market needs. Infrastructure Australia cited the Australian Energy Market Operator, which called for 26 gigawatts of new grid-scale renewables and 6–19 gigawatts of new dispatchable storage by 2040. “Introduction of new firming capacity will complement variable renewable energy sources and support the transition to the new electricity mix. “However, without sufficient dispatchable capacity, there is a risk of power outages and load shedding in the Nem.” Infrastructure Australia said potential options included distributed batteries, large-scale battery storage systems, and utility-scale pumped hydro. Infrastructure Australia also listed the Beetaloo Basin as a high priority in the long term – 10 to 15 years – due to the “significant quantity of gas that could be within economically feasible depths to extract”.
But its future would “depend largely on extraction costs, environmental impacts, and global trends and policies that impact the role of natural gas in the energy mix in Australia and overseas”. In the near term – within the next five years – Infrastructure Australia listed hydrogen infrastructure as a priority due to “growing interest in the production and use of green hydrogen as an energy source, as it produces no carbon emissions”. Infrastructure Australia chief executive, Romilly Madew, told Guardian Australia that when it consulted stakeholders in mid-2020 it was “clear that infrastructure needs were changing due to Covid and it was really important to respond to that”. Enabling digital health services for regional and remote Australia was listed as a high priority in the near term as Covid-19 had “accelerated the need for telehealth services”, the report said. “By November 2020, more than 3.2m regional and remote Australians had accessed telehealth services.” Infrastructure Australia warned there was a “growing ‘digital divide’ between well-connected and poorly-connected areas of Australia”. “While there have been some improvements in market competition, many regional areas still face these issues and may not have access to future technologies such as 5G.” Madew noted her agency had also released a report on which Covid trends were set to last, and found the trends to digitisation and telehealth were permanent. By contrast, the reduction in public transport patronage was judged to be a “temporary bump”, offering a chance to catch up on maintenance. Madew said the pause in net overseas migration also shifted the priority list towards upgrading existing infrastructure, through maintenance, improved connectivity and safety. She cited the Parkes bypass from Melbourne to Brisbane as one such priority. Of the new 44 priorities, five were port projects reflecting the need to “develop export gateways” and the importance ports had played in maintaining freight during Covid, she said.
Level crossing removals in south-east Queensland, Adelaide and Perth were also listed, reflecting the Victorian government’s success with removals in Melbourne. Across the country, other high priorities include: New South Wales – greater Sydney water security, digital infrastructure at Western Parkland City, social housing, Parramatta outer ring-road capacity, and the western Sydney freight line and intermodal terminal Queensland – south-east Queensland level crossings congestion and safety South Australia – Adelaide’s outer ring route capacity, and road maintenance to reduce congestion Northern Territory – enabling infrastructure for developing the Beetaloo Sub-Basin for potential gas market opportunities National initiatives listed as a “priority” include Melbourne to Adelaide freight rail improvements and road access on the Outback Way. In its 2020 list, Infrastructure Australia nominated environmental concerns including rising sea levels, water security and waste management as among its top priorities."
2021-02-25T16:10:12Z,business,Business,Primark sales plunge by Â£1.5bn but chain 'expects to break even',"Sales at Primark have dropped £1.5bn while its shops have been closed during the pandemic, but the fast-fashion retailer predicted a surge in shoppers when the high street reopens. John Bason, the finance director of Primark’s parent company, Associated British Foods (ABF), said the UK’s vaccination programme would encourage people back to its shops in greater numbers when the current lockdown ended and non-essential retailers were allowed to reopen, from no earlier than 12 April. “We will come back strongly,” he said. “The game changer for me is the vaccine. In the first reopening there was a reluctance by a good part of the population to be going out and about. The vaccine has changed that.” After a year of not buying certain kinds of clothing – for work, nights out and special occasions – Bason said the evidence from Austria, where Primark reopened stores three weeks ago, was that sales would be ahead of last year as shoppers bought a broader range of clothing than last summer. “Probably the worst is behind us,” he said. The optimistic forecast comes after ABF estimated Primark would sell £2.2bn of goods in the 24 weeks to 27 February, £1.5bn lower than the equivalent period in the year before. Health concerns and restrictions on travel meant that even when shops were open they reported a 15% decline in like-for-like sales. City-centre stores were hit by a lack of commuters and tourists, while stores in out-of-town retail parks sold clothes faster than before the pandemic. ABF’s interests in groceries, sugar and agriculture increased sales and profits in the past six months, but the pandemic has pummelled its money-spinning Primark chain, with further pain to come. ABF said it expected a further £480m in lost sales at the fashion chain during the next six months as temporary store closures continue. However, the company said it expected Primark, which does not sell its products online, to break even narrowly on an adjusted measure of profitability over the last six months. It hopes to save cash over the next six months partly by selling £150m of stock held over from last spring and summer. Another £260m of stock from autumn and winter 2020 is being held over for this year’s chillier seasons. Primark’s 153 stores in England will reopen on 12 April if all goes to plan. By 26 April, 83% of Primark’s shop floorspace should be up and running l compared with less than a quarter on Thursday. The group plans to launch 15 new stores this year, including three in the US and five in Spain, and has also signed two additional leases on shops in New York state and three in Spain.
Bason said that while Primark was unlikely to open additional stores in the UK, it had got “white space to move into” around the world, and the demise of some other retailers during the pandemic had provided “big nice opportunities” to pick up stores, particularly in mainland Europe. Primark has resisted pressure to invest in an online shop, a strategy that had – until the coronavirus pandemic – appeared to pay off with big profits. ABF added that it had not suffered any material disruption from the UK’s exit from the EU’s single market."
2021-02-25T15:48:25Z,business,Business,Melrose under fire over plans to close GKN factory in Birmingham,"Poland and France will benefit from the planned closure of GKN’s factory in Birmingham, with local plants taking on work currently carried out by 500 of the group’s UK employees, under plans being considered by its owner, Melrose. Melrose, a private-equity group, announced plans in January to close the factory run by its GKN subsidiary in Erdington, Birmingham, in a blow to the embattled British manufacturing sector. The plant produces drivetrain components for petrol and diesel cars. The proposals angered unions and local MPs because of previous assurances to the UK given by Melrose during its £8bn hostile takeover of GKN in 2018. The plans, which are subject to mandatory consultations with employees, could lead to about four-fifths of Birmingham’s work being moved to a plant in Oleśnica, south-west Poland. The rest of the work could move to locations in France, people with knowledge of the plans told the Guardian. Melrose confirmed that Poland manufactures similar products, but did not respond to questions about France. Simon Peckham, the chief executive of the FTSE 100 company, apologised for the difficulties faced by workers in Birmingham, but did not respond directly three times when asked if work would move to the EU, at a hearing with MPs on the business select committee on Tuesday. However, Peckham said the decision to close the factory was not linked to Brexit. He said it had lost £100m over a decade of consecutive losses. Shrinking demand from its UK carmaking customers meant the factory had lost a quarter of its work. Another 40% was under threat in the move to electric cars, he said. Melrose had inherited GKN’s current manufacturing footprint from previous management, he added. The Unite union alleged that Peckham had misled parliament in his description of the Birmingham plant’s manufacturing capabilities and by omitting to detail the proposals to move production.
In a statement, the Unite national officer for automotive, Des Quinn, said Peckham should clarify his evidence. Jack Dromey, the Labour MP for the Erdington constituency where the plant is located, said: “It’s not true that the Chester Road plant does not manufacture for the automotive industry, and it is the sad truth that the company intends to export British jobs to Europe.” A Melrose spokesperson said: “No matter how often these unfounded allegations are trotted out by Mr Dromey, it doesn’t make them true.” Melrose said Peckham was unable to give details on its plans for the work done in Birmingham because they were under consultation with workers. The company strongly denied the claim that Peckham misled parliament and said it had not breached its assurances."
2021-02-25T14:40:05Z,business,Business,Concerns raised over 'squalid' Serco asylum seeker housing in Derby,"A council is arranging an urgent inspection of asylum seeker accommodation in Derby after concerns were raised about conditions there. Photos of the property seen by the Guardian show part of the kitchen ceiling missing, rubble in the base of a shower, cracked and missing tiles, rusted pipes and plaster missing from walls where wallpaper has peeled off. The garden is strewn with litter and discarded furniture.
There are about 64,000 people in Home Office accommodation. The majority are in shared housing, and about 10,000 are in hotel accommodation. It has been reported that the Home Office is planning to accelerate moving people out of hotels and into housing, known as dispersed accommodation, in a scheme called Operation Oak. One of the asylum seekers in the house in Derby was moved from a hotel in Birmingham just over a week ago. He said: “The conditions in this house are so bad they make normal life impossible. I have not been able to take a bath for a week because water was pouring from the bathroom through the kitchen ceiling.” Serco, the company that has the Home Office contract for provision of accommodation in this part of the UK, was last year fined £2.6m for failings on a Home Office accommodation contract between September 2019 and January 2020. It had previously received a fine of £1m on another asylum seeker accommodation contract. Serco told the Guardian last year it was broadly meeting its performance standards and had improved performance on addressing emergency maintenance issues and resolving people’s complaints.
Clare Moseley, the founder of the charity Care4Calais, which is providing support for many asylum seekers in various kinds of Home Office accommodation, said: “I am disgusted to see anyone living in conditions as squalid as these. We have recently witnessed the Home Office’s uncaring attitude towards asylum seekers in hotel accommodation. What are we going to see next in dispersal accommodation?”
Sarah Burnett, Serco’s operations director for immigration, said: “Looking after the asylum seekers in our care and ensuring that they are kept safe is always our first priority. When complaints are raised our team of professional housing officers, maintenance and gas engineers responds and investigates and corrects the problems as and where they exist. We do this within strict timetables laid down in our contract.”
Serco sources said one communal bathroom was working and one was being “isolated” to stop leaks going through the ceiling into the kitchen and that part of the kitchen ceiling had been removed to fix the leaks. The sources acknowledged that the working shower cubicle, which is covered in black mould, was in need of minor repairs and a thorough clean. “There is rubbish in the garden, which is partly due to refurbishment work and partly due to previous occupants leaving it there; Covid has prevented the timely removal of all this, but that will be put right in the coming days,” Burnett added. She said the kitchen had been fully refurbished last summer. A spokesperson for Derby city council said: “Based on the evidence provided in the photos, Derby city council does have concerns regarding the condition of the property. The council’s housing standards team will be inspecting this property as a matter of urgency. A discussion has taken place with Serco and we are in the process of arranging an inspection.”"
2021-02-25T14:37:25Z,business,Business,US Postal Service's new mail truck delivers mixed bag of responses,"When the United States Postal Service unveiled its futuristic new mail truck, it must have been hoping for a positive response. After all, there hasn’t been a new USPS truck since 1994 and designers have been working on the upgrade for six long years. But images of the new delivery vehicle, delicately posed in publicity shots against leafy backgrounds evoking the American suburban idyll, generated one emotion above all. Hilarity.
Politico’s transportation reporter Sam Mintz took it upon himself to stage a Twitter straw poll asking whether the truck was sleek and cool, or an ugly duckling. The result was a clear 60% in favor of the latter. The good news is that the new model, to be made by the defense contractor Oshkosh, will have a raft of safety features when it hits the roads in 2023. Unlike the rickety old machines currently rattling across the US which have no AC, dangerous blindspots for drivers, and can spontaneously catch fire, the new fleet will have airbags, automatic braking and 360-degree cameras to prevent accidents. They will be either petrol or electric-powered. The bad news is that it is arguably the least attractive automobile since the Fiat Multipla, which looks not so much like an ugly duckling as a heavyweight boxer after an especially bloody bout in the ring. Late-night TV hosts had a field day with the new USPS trucks. Jimmy Kimmel called the design “unremarkable and yet vaguely unsettling”. The cruellest take was from James Corden, who likened the truck to Justin Timberlake’s face – a pretty brutal slight on both parties. To be fair, some people leapt to the ugly duckling’s defense. The actor Kelli Maroney said: “It’s adorable and I LOVE it.” Perhaps a resolution of these polarised reactions will be possible by the time the vehicle comes on stream in two years’ time. One Twitter user showed the potential way that America could fall in love with its new national delivery icon: Their take: “FALSE BINARY. IT LOOKS LIKE A DUCK AND THATS WHAT MAKES IT COOL!!!!!!!!!” • This article was amended on 26 February 2021 to remove a reference that was inconsistent with editorial guidelines."
2021-02-25T14:35:57Z,business,Business,Goldman Sachs' boss wants bankers back to their desks ASAP,"The chief executive of Goldman Sachs has signalled his determination to get his bankers back behind their office desks, calling home working an “aberration” that must be corrected “as soon as possible”. While the bank operated successfully throughout the Covid crisis with less than 10% of its 34,000 global staff working in the bank’s offices, David Solomon dashed the hopes of any Goldman staff hoping to split their time between their homes and offices in the future, saying it did not represent “a new normal” for the firm. “That’s a temporary thing. I do think that for a business like ours, which is an innovative, collaborative apprenticeship culture, this is not ideal for us. And it’s not a new normal. It’s an aberration that we’re going to correct as soon as possible,” he told a virtual conference run by Credit Suisse.
The comments contradict the laidback image that the new Goldman boss has tried to portray since taking over as chief executive in late 2018. Solomon, who moonlights as DJ D-Sol, has been known for eschewing Wall Street’s stuffy reputation, even relaxing the investment bank’s dress code to make suits and ties optional. While he acknowledged that the pandemic had helped the bank shift more of its operations online, Solomon said he wasitching to get back into the office. “At the end of the day, I’m a big believer in personal connectivity in a business like ours, and I don’t think as we get out of the pandemic, the overall operating mode – the way a business like ours operates – will be vastly different.” Views on remote working after the Covid crisis are slowly dividing the corporate world. Earlier this week, lending giant HSBC revealed it was taking advantage of the booming popularity of home working by cutting its office space by 40%, while rival Lloyds announced it would slash its own office footprint by a fifth.
Lloyds’ decision was made after 77% of Lloyds’ 68,000 employees said they wanted to work from home for three or more days a week in future. According to a recent poll by recruiter Robert Half, 89% of firms expect hybrid working – with staff split between home and office – to become permanent after the pandemic. But Solomon said he was particularly concerned about how to train the next generation of bankers if most staff were working from home. “I’m very focused on the fact that I don’t want another class of young people arriving at Goldman Sachs in the summer remotely … that aren’t getting more direct contact, direct apprenticeship, direct mentorship.” The Goldman boss is not alone. His Wall Street rival JP Morgan has also raised concerns about the impact of home working, including the lack of mentoring for young staff, and a small drop in productivity on Mondays and Fridays. However, the lender is still expecting up to 30% of its almost 257,000 global employees to work remotely in future, at least part of the time.
Barclays boss Jes Staley has also backtracked from statements made last April when he declared the days of putting 7,000 people into a single building “may be a thing of the past”. Speaking to reporters last week, Staley described home working as “getting old”. “I look forward to us being able to welcome colleagues back into the office. That will certainly happen sometime this year.” In the meantime, Goldman is still asking all of its UK staff to work from home in line with government guidance. Only critical staff who cannot work remotely are commuting, meaning 5-10% of its 6,000 UK workforce are in office on any given day."
2021-02-25T13:52:58Z,business,Business,British Gas owner plans new turnaround effort as profits hit record low,"The owner of British Gas has launched its second turnaround programme in five years after the energy supplier’s earnings plunged to their lowest on record. The supplier’s full-year earnings tumbled by more than a third to £80m last year after the coronavirus pandemic caused many of its business customers to shut their offices, while homes used less gas and electricity over the warm and bright summer months. The earnings are a fraction of the supplier’s record high annual profits of £742m, recorded 10 years ago before the steady decline of the British Gas business. Britain’s biggest energy supplier confirmed that its customer numbers fell by a further 2% to 6.9 million last year. The pandemic also triggered a collapse in global commodity prices, which led Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, to a £1.6bn impairment charge and a full-year pre-tax loss of £577m. That is half the size of last year’s £1.1bn loss, when Centrica also made heavy writedowns. Chris O’Shea, who has served as chief executive of Centrica since last year, will begin a “major transformation” of the company, only a year after the end of five-year turnaround plan put in place by the former boss Iain Conn in 2015. O’Shea was the company’s chief financial officer from 2018. Centrica’s has lost three-quarters of its market value after its share price plummeted from an all-time high of more than 400p in 2013 to a record low of just over 32p a share last year. The company has crashed out of the FTSE 100, slashed shareholder dividends twice since 2015, and last year promised to cut 5,000 jobs. The staff cull has led to a standoff between Centrica’s executives and the trade union GMB. Alongside the cuts, the company has asked all remaining employees to sign up to tougher new employment contracts or risk losing their jobs. GMB said 7,000 British Gas engineers would down tools for four days from this Friday until Monday as part of ongoing industrial action.
O’Shea said of the change programme: “It won’t be easy. Our journey to transform has only just started, as we seek to restore shareholder value by improving customer experience, retention and employee engagement, while maintaining a strong balance sheet.” The company said “significant uncertainties” were expected to continue into 2021 as the UK emerged from coronavirus restrictions, and offered no specific earnings or cashflow guidance for the year ahead. It said there would be no dividend for 2020 but would “recommence dividends to shareholders when it is prudent to do so”. Investors responded by selling Centrica shares, causing their price to drop by 5% to lows of 50.34p in early trading."
2021-02-25T12:25:53Z,business,Business,Thousands of Asda jobs at risk in online shopping push,"About 5,000 jobs are at risk at Asda, which is shutting two warehouses and eliminating thousands ofback-office jobs as part of an online grocery push. The Leeds-based company confirmed a formal consultation with staff had begun as it sought to close two so-called dark stores in Dartford, Kent, and Heston, west London, and switch to picking grocery orders from the shelves of local stores. The decision affects 800 staff. Asda is also making big changes to how stores are managed. It is proposing that cash office, administration and HR tasks be completed by “one multi-skilled back-office colleague”. This shake-up affects 3,000 workers, with the company citing the reduction of cash handling as shoppers switch to cards. The chief executive, Roger Burnley, said the pandemic had resulted in a big shift towards online grocery shopping and the business had to adapt quickly. “As customer habits continue to change we have to evolve our business to meet these demands and ensure our business is strong and sustainable for the long term,” he said. Asda is also scrapping the deputy store managers and section leader roles and replacing them with operations manager and online trading manager roles, which are still salaried positions. The move affects 1,100 employees but the changes would increase the number of store-level management roles, it said. It also emerged that Boots has embarked on the second round of job cuts in less than a year at its head office in Beeston, Nottinghamshire. The restructuring will eliminate 300 roles, about a tenth of the site’s workforce. Boots, which is part of the global Walgreen Boots Alliance chain, eliminated 4,000 jobs last year through a combination of store closures and head office cuts. No store or pharmacist roles are affected by the new cuts, but Usdaw’s national officer, Daniel Adams, described them as devastating for those affected. The Asda shake-up is not linked to the £6.8bn sale ofthe supermarket chain to the petrol forecourt billionaires Mohsin and Zuber Issa and TDR Capital, which was finalised last week. That is because the deal is yet to be cleared by the Competition and Markets Authority. Although 5,000 workers are affected by the consultation, the company expects a “large number of colleagues will remain with us in either their current role or one of the newly created roles”.
The priority would be to move as many workers as possible into alternative roles, with redundancy the last option, Asda said. The expansion of its web operations would create 4,500 jobs, it added. The company, which has a total workforce of 145,000, has increased its online capacity by 90% since March to 850,000 weekly slots. It expects to be fulfilling 1m orders a week by the end of the year. Burnley said the business was adapting to the changing demands of the retail sector as shoppers switched to online services during the pandemic. Within a year, delivery volumes had reached a target the company had expected to take nine years to achieve. “We know these proposed changes will be unsettling for colleagues and our priority is to support them during this consultation process,” he said. “Our plans to transform the business will result in more roles being created than those we propose to remove.” Boots also blamed it head office cuts on a dramatically altered retail landscape. Its managing director, Seb James, said the pandemic had changed consumer behaviours forever. As an essential retailer, Boots stores have stayed open during the lockdowns, but trade has been disrupted. Sales at established stores were down 9% at the last count. Stores on major high streets and in transport hubs have been hit by the decline in shopper numbers, while online orders have risen strongly. “This means investing in our digital business, serving customers more efficiently and, above all, becoming much swifter and more agile,” said James. “We will do everything we can to make sure that we support and help anybody who is affected.”"
2021-02-25T09:49:54Z,business,Business,Drax scraps plan for Europe's largest gas plant after climate protests,"Drax has scrapped its controversial plans to build Europe’s largest gas power plant at its site in North Yorkshire following fierce opposition from climate groups. The electricity generator confirmed that it would drop plans to build two combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) in place of two old coal burning units at the Drax site, weeks after completing the sale of four other gas plants to a subsidiary of Vitol last month. The decision to cancel the plans draws a line under three years of opposition from green groups who argued they were inconsistent with the UK’s ambitions to lead the world in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The opposition included a legal challenge against the government after ministers overruled the climate change concerns raised by the UK’s planning authority, which said the 3.6GW plant would undermine the UK’s legally binding climate targets. The challenge failed in the court of appeal last month. Drax plans to focus on burning wood pellets, after decades as one of the UK’s biggest coal plant operators. It has promised to end its commercial sales of coal-fired electricity from next month, ahead of the government’s 2025 ban on coal power. However, the company may still build another four small-scale gas plants, each 299MW and designed for short run-times during times of peak electricity demand. The decision to scrap the new gas project will cost the company £13m, according to its annual financial reports. It reported a £156m operating loss for 2020, after recording a total charge of £239m from the cancelled gas project and writing off the value of its remaining coal inventories, and counting the £34m cost of closing its coal burning units. The FTSE-listed utility plans to focus on plans to generate more electricity by burning wood chips, known as biomass, which it claims is a carbon neutral “renewable” energy source because the trees absorb carbon dioxide before they emit carbon while burning in a power plant. Scientists and environmentalists have questioned the carbon accounting of biomass burning, and whether growing trees and shipping the wood pellets can be considered sustainable. Companies including Drax have produced scientific papers which they say proves that biomass can be considered a clean energy source. Will Gardiner, the chief executive of Drax Group, said the company’s plan to buy Pinnacle Renewable Energy – a major manufacturer of wood pellets in Canada – would “position Drax as the world’s leading sustainable biomass generation and supply business” and pave the way for Drax to “develop bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) – taking us even further in our decarbonisation”. Drax claims that using carbon capture technology to trap the emissions from the burning wood at its sites would make its power plant “carbon negative” by 2030. The claims are disputed by scientists and green groups."
2021-02-25T08:31:47Z,business,Business,Losses at Aston Martin almost quadruple as Covid cuts sales,"Aston Martin Lagonda’s losses nearly quadrupled during 2020 as the pandemic hit sales just as the sports carmaker’s new bosses were starting a turnaround plan. The carmaker on Thursday reported a £466m loss before tax for the year, compared with a £120m loss in 2019, as sales slumped and it wrote off nearly £100m of investments in now-abandoned products such as the Rapide electric car. It also missed out on its usual marketing boost from being featured in the James Bond film franchise, after the release of No Time to Die was repeatedly delayed by the pandemic. The carmaker’s revenues slumped by 38% year-on-year to £611m for 2020. However, the company did highlight glimmers of hope in an improved final quarter of 2020 thanks to sales of its new DBX SUV, with revenues 3% higher than the same period in 2019, before the pandemic. Aston Martin sold 4,150 cars during 2020, a third less than in 2019. The carmaker had warned even before the pandemic struck that it would cut sales in 2020 as it tried to restore exclusivity to its brand. However, the pandemic forced temporary closures of both its factories and dealerships at varying points during the year. The latest results mean Aston Martin has lost £638m in the three years since it listed on the London Stock Exchange, underlining the challenge still left for its management and owners to revive the company. Lawrence Stroll, a Canadian billionaire who made his fortune with fashion investments, took control of Aston Martin in January 2020 under a £500m rescue deal. He replaced Andy Palmer as chief executive with Tobias Moers, the former boss of Daimler’s high-performance division, Mercedes-AMG. Moers played an important role in securing a deal with his former employer, Daimler, in which it took a 20% stake in return for giving access to hybrid and battery electric technologies, reducing the need for significant investment.
Moers said “demand is strong” for the DBX, priced at £158,000, and added that the company was ahead of schedule with reducing the number of sports cars languishing in dealership. There are “encouraging signs for demand” for sports cars, he added. Aston Martin is now planning to sell about 6,000 cars in 2021. It hopes to increase sales to 10,000 cars by 2024 or 2025, making about £2bn in revenues. That equates to a target of £500m in operating earnings before various costs. Stroll said he was “extremely pleased with the progress to date despite operating in these most challenging of times”. He added that he was “fully committed” to the company’s plan."
2021-02-25T07:01:20Z,business,Business,"UK's gas power plans risk derailing climate targets, thinktank says","Fossil fuel companies risk derailing the UK’s climate targets and pushing up household bills by planning to build a string of new gas-fired power plants worth £9bn, according to a thinktank. The UK has 17 gas-fired plants proposed with a combined generation capacity of 14GW. They include plans for Europe’s largest at the Drax site in North Yorkshire. If all 17 were built and used to generate power they would produce 24m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, the equivalent of 7% of the UK’s emissions in 2019, according to a report by CarbonTracker. The multi-billion pound investments would also run the risk of being “stranded” because they are more expensive than clean energy technologies which can generate electricity at a lower cost, the thinktank said. The author of the report, Catharina Hillenbrand von der Neyen, said cheaper, cleaner energy options including onshore wind, solar farms and batteries, could fill the gap left by the closure of old coal and nuclear plants without having to invest in gas-fired electricity. “By ignoring a least-cost clean energy solution, the UK risks veering off a net zero pathway and penalising consumers, as they will be the ones to bear the higher electricity prices,” she said. The UK’s future energy system would use more batteries, which could make better use of renewable energy sources, she said, and more flexible electricity use could avoid the need for backup supplies generated from fossil fuels. The UK’s last coal power plants are scheduled to shut by 2025 under the government’s ban on coal-fired electricity, by which time almost half the UK’s nuclear reactors are also due to be decommissioned. Energy companies plan to fill the gap with the new gas-fired power plants. The CarbonTracker report was based on current project proposals in the UK, and did not take into account plans which might be scrapped before major investments decisions are taken. The largest plant planned, to replace two of the Drax coal-burning units with combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGTs), could be scrapped this week after provoking fierce opposition from green groups and an unsuccessful legal challenge. Drax is expected to announce its full-year financial results on Thursday, and may also reveal plans to abandon the gas project to focus on its investments in bioenergy and carbon capture technology. The company sold its portfolio of four gas plants late last year to VPI Holdings – an affiliate of energy trading giant Vitol – for £193m. It said they did not form part of its core strategy. A spokesperson for Drax said the company had not made an announcement about its future gas projects at the Drax site, once the largest coal-generation plant in the UK, but would provide clarity on its plans on Thursday."
2021-02-25T06:00:20Z,business,Business,UK economy at the crossroads before lockdown ends,"Covid cases fall during lockdown
The number of daily new confirmed coronavirus infections has fallen in the past month but remains higher than in the first wave of the pandemic. As the government plots a course to relaxing Covid restrictions in four stages this spring, the seven-day average for the number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test has fallen to 400, from almost 1,300 in early January. After the government hit its target to offer the vaccine to the four most at risk groups in the UK, almost 18 million people have had a first jab. Almost 650,000 have had a second. Mobility climbs despite continued lockdown
The number of trips taken on UK roads and public transport has increased slightly in the past month, in a sign that more people are starting to leave their homes despite the continued lockdown. According to Apple mobility data – which records requests made to Apple Maps for directions – bus and train journeys are still down by more than half from pre-pandemic levels but have crept up in recent weeks. Mobility levels are higher than during the first lockdown, reflecting a lesser impact on economic activity. Stock market gains after unlocking roadmap
Shares in the British companies most likely to benefit from the easing of Covid restrictions have rallied on the London stock market after Boris Johnson set out the government’s roadmap for ending lockdown in England. However, concerns are growing that a faster economic recovery would trigger a surge in inflation, which could force central banks to raise interest rates. It comes at a time when several global markets, including the Dow Jones and the Japanese Nikkei, are close to record highs. The FTSE 100 has risen by about 150 points since the start of the month, to trade at about 6,600. The index of leading UK company shares still remains about 1,000 points below its pre-pandemic level in early 2020. Inflation edges higher as food prices rise
Rising food prices drove up inflation in January. The consumer prices index (CPI) rose to 0.7% from 0.6% a month earlier as food and household goods stores put up their prices, and offered fewer discounts this year on items such as beds and settees. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) noted price rises on frozen fish fingers, vegetables such as cauliflowers, and premium crisps. Analysts said the inflation rate would probably rise further over the coming months as the economy gradually reopens. Business activity stronger than feared in February
Britain’s economy showed signs of steadying in February after the plunge in business activity in January when lockdown measures were reintroduced. Closely watched surveys of company managers showed the situation improved for services firms but the economy still remained in contraction as restrictions took their toll. The flash IHS Markit/Cips purchasing managers index jumped to 49.8 from 41.2 in January, just below the 50 mark that divides expansion from contraction. With rising Covid infections on the continent, activity in the eurozone remained subdued. However, activity hit a six-year high in the US. Although losing some momentum, China’s economic recovery continued. Unemployment rises despite furlough extension
The impact of Covid-19 on the economy drove up the unemployment rate to 5.1% in the three months to the end of December – representing 1.74 million people – up from 5% in the three months to the end of November, according to the ONS. The jobless rate was 4% before the pandemic struck. However, figures from HMRC showed 83,000 employees were added to company payrolls in January, in a promising sign for the jobs market despite the third lockdown. It comes after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, extended the furlough scheme, now due to run until the end of April. The chancellor is coming under pressure to provide extra support as job losses climb. Retail sales plunge during third lockdown
British retail sales fell by 8.2% in January from a month earlier amid the toughest Covid lockdown since the first wave of the pandemic. With the closure of stores on high streets and in shopping centres, sales plunged across the retail sector, apart from food stores and online, where spending increased. Internet sales accounted for a record 35.2% of sales last month, up from 29.6% a month ago, when more physical shops were open in the run-up to Christmas. A year ago, online sales were running at 19.5%. The ONS said after steadily recovering from the impact of the first lockdown, the latest restrictions had pushed the volume of sales down to 5.5% below pre-pandemic levels. Budget deficit rises before chancellor’s budget
Sunak’s budget on 3 March will be framed by record levels of government borrowing and debt as state spending soars in response to Covid and tax revenues collapse. Public sector borrowing was £8.8bn in January, the highest on record for a month when self-assessed tax receipts usually help to generate a surplus. It takes the budget deficit – the gap between spending and receipts – to about £271bn for the first 10 months of the financial year, up £222bn on a year ago. December’s borrowing pushed the national debt – the sum total of every deficit – to £2.1tn, or about 97.9% of gross domestic product, the highest debt ratio since the early 1960s. Sunak has said “hard choices” must be taken to balance the books. But economists warn austerity or tax rises could derail the UK’s economic recovery. Double-dip recession avoided despite record slump
Official figures confirmed the UK economy suffered its biggest annual decline in 300 years in 2020 amid the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, but that a double-dip recession at the end of the year was avoided. The ONS said gross domestic product fell by 9.9% in 2020, the biggest decline since 1709, as no sector of the economy was left unscathed. However, companies learning to adapt to lockdown and looser controls in December helped the economy to grow by 1% in the final three months of the year. Although avoiding a return to recession during the second wave of the pandemic, economists expect GDP is shrinking again at the start of 2021 amid the toughest lockdown since the first wave of Covid-19. House prices fall as stamp duty deadline looms
House prices in the UK fell in January by the most in almost a year, as the Covid homebuying boom fuelled by the government’s stamp duty holiday fades. With the end of the tax break looming at the end of March and disruption from the renewed lockdown, the price of an average property fell 0.3% month on month, according to Halifax. The fall ends a seventh-month streak of house price growth as Britons scrambled to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday. Property industry experts have warned prices could fall dramatically this year after the tax break ends and as unemployment rises. Sunak is, however, reportedly considering an extension at the budget. And another thing we’ve learned this month … Household savings could power economic revival but inequality has risen
British households have saved record amounts during the coronavirus pandemic as people have spent less money during lockdown and made savings on travel costs and eating out while working from home. The chief economist at the Bank of England, Andy Haldane, says this means families are poised “like a coiled spring” to fuel a rapid return to economic growth with a multibillion-pound spending spree. Official figures show record repayments on credit cards and personal loans and the UK’s households savings ratio – a snapshot of savings as a proportion of disposable income – hitting a record high of 27% in June last year, and staying at historically high levels since. But this rise in average saving masks severe financial pain for lower-income households bearing the brunt of Covid job losses. It is mostly those in the top 40% saving money and it is unclear how much of those savings will be spent in the recovery."
2021-02-25T06:00:19Z,business,Business,UK businesses plead for further support in run-up to budget,"Rishi Sunak is preparing to deliver next week’s budget with the British economy at a pivotal moment before lockdown is relaxed, with businesses and workers still under severe strain, according to a Guardian analysis. After the prime minister set out the government’s roadmap for dismantling Covid restrictions over four key stages this spring, the chancellor is expected to use his 15th major tax and spending announcement in less than a year on Wednesday to pledge further financial support to steer the economy towards recovery. It comes as Britain is suffering the worst economic damage since the pandemic began and with unemployment continuing to rise, although there are hopes for a swift recovery later this year fuelled by rapid progress administering the Covid vaccine. But with months of restrictions to come, business leaders warn Britain stands at a crossroads with urgent further government support required. Calling next week’s budget the most important in living memory, Tony Danker, the director general of the CBI, urged the chancellor to extend support for struggling firms and their workers and do more to boost companies in sectors of the economy subject to the longest lockdown controls. Writing in the Guardian, the leader of Britain’s foremost business lobby group warned the task of protecting the economy from Covid remained unfinished. “Business support measures have been second to none, but now is not the time to bring them to a shuddering halt, particularly for those sectors that still have a way to go,” he said. “The chancellor must finish what he started: doing whatever it takes to back UK business. The more businesses – the more jobs – that we can see through the crisis, the faster we can snap the economy back into shape.”
Since the onset of the pandemic, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the level of the FTSE 100, to track the impact of coronavirus on jobs and growth, and the measures used to contain it. Faced with the deepest global recession since the Great Depression, the Covid crisis watch also monitors how the UK is faring compared with other countries. Official figures confirmed this month that Britain suffered among the worst economic downturns in the western world last year, with a 9.9% drop in gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 – the biggest annual plunge since 1709. Having recorded the highest death toll in Europe from Covid-19, it was the worst in the G7, exacerbated by a slower entry into lockdown last year and later exit, as well as a higher proportion of social spending – such as in hospitality and retail, hit hardest by the pandemic – than in other major countries. However, the UK fared better than some other wealthy countries including Spain, where the economy collapsed by 11% last year. However, a double-dip recession has been avoided after companies adapted to the second lockdown and took advantage of looser Covid restrictions in the run-up to Christmas before the third national shutdown was imposed. There are also signs of resilience this month from a recovery in business activity in February, despite the continued pressure of lockdown, while mobility levels have risen slightly as more people leave their homes as Covid infections gradually fall.
Average household savings have risen during lockdown as many people cut back on spending on travel, shopping and eating out while working from home. According to Andy Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England, the savings glut means the economy is about to turn “a decisive corner with enormous amounts of pent-up financial energy waiting to be released, like a coiled spring”.
However, there is uncertainty over how much will be spent as the economy reopens and confidence takes time to recover amid the risk of new Covid variants, a new wave of infections and international travel controls. Savings have also been concentrated among higher-income households as poorer workers bear the brunt of the economic damage, threatening to exacerbate inequality coming out of the crisis. Younger workers, the self-employed and those in more precarious hospitality and retail jobs falling out of work has also driven up unemployment to 5.1% in the three months to the end of December. With about 4.5 million people furloughed during the latest lockdown, business leaders, unions and Labour are calling for Sunak to extend the support, warning of a tidal wave of job losses without action. The chancellor is being urged to spend £100bn at the budget in a mix of short-term economic support and long-term investment to bolster Britain’s recovery, despite an anticipated £382bn hole in the public finances. Sunak has warned that the biggest increase in the budget deficit in peacetime will require “hard choices” on tax and spending to be taken. However, the Resolution Foundation thinktank said extending emergency support was necessary in line with the new timetable for easing public health restrictions – including the furlough scheme remaining in place until the summer, and targeted grants for the worst affected sectors like hospitality. James Smith, a research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: “That [£100bn] is the scale of ambition needed to increase the chances that Britain sees a strong recovery from its pandemic-induced slump, and to ensure the recovery reaches firms and families across the UK.”"
2021-02-25T06:00:19Z,business,Business,"Sunak’s budget needs to focus on business investment, not just government spending","Each year, people like me will tell you that the upcoming budget is the most important in living memory; that the government must grab the bull by the horns to deliver economic growth for the country. Well, after 11 months of businesses driven to the lowest of ebbs, this one is indeed a big deal. In spite of all this, I’m optimistic that better times may be around the corner soon. The prime minister set out a pragmatic, common sense roadmap to easing lockdown this week. Yes, we might not be as quick to reopen as some may have hoped, but it is data driven with caution as the watchword. Firms are now hoping Rishi Sunak’s budget will be the second half to this story. The roadmap sets out where we want to go and the budget will determine what shape business will be in when we get there. There are three key components that business will be looking for in the budget. First, to shield businesses from the final harsh winds of this third lockdown. Second, it must be the catalyst to get firms investing once again – in skills, jobs and innovation. And finally, it must also offer the first glimpses of what a longer-term plan for economic growth could look like. People are worn down by the latest lockdown, and so are businesses. Many remain in emergency mode with cashflows tight, operations restricted and most doing their best to tackle the mental health challenges facing staff. Business support measures have been second to none, but now is not the time to bring them to a shuddering halt, particularly for those sectors that still have a way to go. Furlough, business rates holidays and VAT deferrals all need extending. Successors to the government-backed loan schemes remain much needed. The Westminster rumour mill sounds positive on these fronts; it would be a bitter disappointment were they not to happen. And yet it cannot be a budget of only firefighting. If we are to regain the substantial economic ground lost over the past year, then the chancellor needs to get those firms – who can – investing. This budget is a chance to drive forward a balanced economic recovery through business investment, not solely by consumption and government spending, as important as they are. Without businesses fit and competitive, there will be no lasting recovery to speak of. One of the biggest priorities to trigger investment is to change the business rates system. Calls for an overhaul of this tax is a groundhog day issue at budget time – but for good reason. It is a system that is uncompetitive, unproductive and unfair – it helps ingrain the UK’s huge regional inequalities. It is a significant factor in the hollowing out of some of our high streets, notwithstanding the major changes in our retail habits that have sped up through the crisis. Firms looking to the government to finally grasp the nettle will have been left disappointed that the review has been pushed back to autumn. But delay must not also mean inaction. The chancellor could unlock more investment by exempting physical green investments such as solar panels and heat pumps from rates. He could also delay rises in rate bills for firms making their buildings more energy efficient. And on net zero, more widely the CBI has also called for action on climate change, to make investing in green the easy choice. A focus on the shift to zero-emission vehicles, fresh jobs in clean industries, a review of fuel duty taxes. All can play a part. With the UK due to host Cop26 this year, we must be unabashed in our ambition to lead the world in meeting the climate challenge. And as part of that investment story, we need to get firms spending on the innovations of tomorrow and help small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) catch up with the technologies of today. So a new research and development tax credit for capital investments is in order, and an “invest to grow” scheme that can incentivise SMEs to adopt digital technologies. Such moves in the budget could prove transformational in the long run and lock in the digital acceleration of the year gone by. There must also be recognition of the fact that business needs are changing. Dropping the apprenticeship levy in favour of a flexible skills and training levy, and transforming jobcentres into jobs and skills hubs, can create opportunities for people in every corner of the country. These measures have plenty in common. Job creation. Security. Reward. They encourage businesses to aim high and think big, to deliver opportunity and prosperity in return. The final component to Sunak’s budget should be the long term. I have spoken this year on the need for a UK economic vision that looks 10 years ahead, not just next year or to the end of this parliament. It is an issue that needs long-term thinking, national unity and consensus. After a global pandemic and beginning the journey outside of the EU, if not now, then when? At the budget next week, therefore, the chancellor must finish what he started: doing whatever it takes to back UK business. The more businesses – the more jobs – that we can see through the crisis, the faster we can snap the economy into shape, investing to make our economy greener, fairer and more dynamic.

2021-02-25T05:00:17Z,business,Business,"Tax abuse and money laundering is trapping billions in poverty, says UN ","Billions of people around the world are being trapped in poverty by systemic tax abuses, corruption and money laundering, according to a UN commission report calling for a global crackdown. The UN panel on financial integrity for sustainable development urged governments to overhaul tax rules and the banking system to help end poverty and tackle the climate emergency. It said up to 10% of the world’s wealth could be hidden offshore at a time when governments were under growing financial strain because of the Covid pandemic, and as inequality soars. The panel of world leaders, central bank governors and business and civil society representatives said criminals were laundering assets worth as much as 2.7% of global GDP each year. They said it was an alarming testament to the way the international financial system was skewed in favour of the wealthy, that even during a pandemic billionaires’ wealth had increased by 27.5% between April and July last year when the rest of the world had been plunged into turmoil. In its final report, the high-level panel on international financial accountability, transparency and integrity (Facti) says greater coordination between countries is required to impose sanctions on enablers of financial crime. Ibrahim Mayaki, the co-chair of the panel and former prime minister of Niger, said: “Closing loopholes that allow money laundering, corruption and tax abuse and stopping bankers, accountants and lawyers from enabling crime are steps in transforming the global economy for the universal good.” The report calls for an international minimum corporate tax rate, more progress towards taxing digital companies and measures to improve the transparency of company ownership and public spending. It says an agreed minimum tax rate of 20-30% on company profits would help limit incentives for multinational companies to shift profits made in one part of the world to a lower-tax jurisdiction, and prevent a “race to the bottom” between countries.
Instigated by George Osborne after the 2008 financial crisis, the UK has steadily cut the rate of corporation tax to 19%, among the lowest in the advanced world. However, the government is thought to be considering raising the tax rate. Ireland’s corporate tax rate is 12.5%. Several UK overseas territories and crown dependencies, including the British Virgin Islands, Guernsey and Jersey, have a zero corporation tax rate. The demands for tougher global action on tax avoidance and evasion comes as the coronavirus pandemic blows a hole in the public finances of governments around the world, amid a boom in emergency spending and collapse in economic activity. The Facti report says recovering losses to tax avoidance and evasion could help countries such as Bangladesh expand its social safety net to 9 million more elderly, in Chad it could pay for 38,000 classrooms, and in Germany it could build 8,000 wind turbines. Dalia Grybauskaitė, the co-chair of Facti and former president of Lithuania, said: “Our report rests on two simple ideas: restore public finance by fixing a broken system and use the trillions of dollars released to eradicate poverty, recover from Covid and tackle the climate crisis.”"
2021-02-25T00:01:11Z,business,Business,Ikea UK loses £33m after closing stores for nearly three months,"Ikea’s UK business dived nearly £33m into the red last year after it was forced to close stores for nearly three months during the pandemic. The world’s largest furniture retailer said UK sales fell more than 10% to £1.9bn in the year to 31 August, even though online sales increased by nearly a third. Ikea admitted that it had struggled to meet demand for home deliveries despite turning stores into distribution centres for online orders during the high street lockdowns. Peter Jelkeby, the UK and Ireland country retail manager for Ikea, said pretax losses had widened to nearly £33m from £2.5m in 2019 because the group had been forced to close stores for three months and invest in infrastructure to make home deliveries.
“We had a good performance before lockdown and I am proud of how resilient we have been,” he said. The drop in sales came despite a strong year for the home furnishings and DIY industry as families rejigged their flats and houses to accommodate schooling and working from home. Sales of wall art doubled and searches for small desks on Ikea’s website quadrupled as the UK prepared for video conferencing from home. Jelkeby said the chain had fast-tracked the introduction of click and collect at all stores and click and deliver to DPD drop-off points “in a year when life at home was never more important”. He said Ikea had paid its workers 100% of their salary throughout the lockdowns with some store staff retraining to process online orders. However, the group has frozen pay for staff until September, meaning it did not increase wages for the lowest paid in line with the living wage last month, despite being accredited to the independently verified pay measure for several years. The company said its accreditation had been “paused”. Jelkeby said Ikea was investing in stores to make them more appealing when they reopen in April, and would add an outlet in Hammersmith, west London, this autumn. He said Ikea remained “committed to investing in locations that make Ikea more accessible” after closing one full-range store in Coventry and two trial small stores in London.
On Wednesday, the US owner of homewares and fashion retailer TK Maxx reported that its international business, led by the 400-strong UK chain, had dived to a $504m (£357m) loss in the year to 30 January from a $307m profit a year before. TJX Companies said sales at its international business, which also includes stores in Australia, Austria, Germany, Ireland and Poland, slid by a third to $3.8bn after it was forced to close stores for months."
2021-02-24T21:07:51Z,business,Business,"Bank of England to 'resist firmly' EU raid on London, warns governor","Andrew Bailey has warned the European Union against mounting a raid on the City of London, saying the Bank of England will “resist very firmly” any moves by Brussels to force financial trading worth trillions of pounds to relocate following Brexit. Amid growing speculation that EU officials could demand more financial business moves within its borders after leaving, Bailey said steps forcing the relocation of euro derivatives clearing away from the UK would represent a “serious escalation”. Addressing MPs on the Commons Treasury committee, Bailey said Brussels appeared to be moving towards a position where euro-denominated derivatives clearing would be forced to take place within the eurozone. “To get that by fiat would require something very controversial such as an attempt at extraterritorial legislation, or an attempt to force or cajole banks and dealers to say there will be some other penalty for you unless you move this clearing activity into the eurozone,” he said. “Quite bluntly, that would be highly controversial and it would be something we would have to and want to resist very firmly.” The dispute centres on the clearing of trades in the vast €681tn EU derivatives market – products bought by professional investors to protect against, or speculate on, movements in financial markets; including the price of shares, bonds, interest rates and currencies. London dominates the market for clearing – which is a central component of the financial system, sitting in-between deals and ensuring trades are completed even if one side of the transaction goes bust. Bailey said some 75% of around €83.5tn in clearing positions now held at the London Stock Exchange’s LCH clearing house, the biggest in the market, are not held by EU counterparties, meaning the EU should not be targeting them. Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal entered into at the start of this year did not include an agreement on financial services, which powers the economy of London and helps contribute 10% of the UK’s taxes, leaving firms at risk of being cut-off from the EU following the end of the transition period on 31 December. Trading in EU shares and derivatives has already left Britain for the continent, with Amsterdam overtaking London as Europe’s largest share trading centre after the first month. Although largely a symbolic blow, experts warned it could be followed by the City losing jobs as well as more business in future. The UK and the EU are aiming to reach an agreement on cooperation over financial services regulation by March. It comes after the EU had temporarily agreed to grant equivalence to the UK’s financial regulations after the end of the Brexit transition to enable trading to continue in the euro derivatives market, in an agreement due to expire at the end of June 2022. Brussels has been working to tempt banks to transfer clearing within the EU after Brexit, as it seeks to cut the bloc’s reliance on a financial centre which now sits outside its borders. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Europe’s top banks have been sent letters asking them to justify why they should not have to relocate the activity, applying renewed pressure. Bailey warned the plan would fragment the derivatives market and push up the cost of trading, saying that the pooling activity in a single location resulted in economies of scale. “In an activity like clearing where the efficiency really comes from having a very deep pooled of derivatives,” he said. “To break that down would increase cost, no question of that.” The comments represent Bailey’s latest intervention after attacking EU demands for City banks to comply with Brussels rules earlier this month, in a combative speech backing the government’s hardline stance in the next round of Brexit talks. Speaking online at the annual Mansion House dinner to finance industry executives, Bailey said the EU had granted equivalence status – a mutual recognition of each side’s regulatory standards – to Canada, the US, Australia, Hong Kong and Brazil based on their adherence to international regulations, but was insisting that London also track the twists and turns of EU rules. “The EU has argued it must better understand how the UK intends to amend or alter the rules going forwards,” he said. “This is a standard that the EU holds no other country to and would, I suspect, not agree to be held to itself. It is hard to see beyond one of two ways of interpreting this statement, neither of which stands up to much scrutiny.”"
2021-02-24T19:57:44Z,business,Business,Lloyds and HSBC are shedding office space ... did they have too much to begin with?,"Here comes another bank that has decided, apparently definitively, that working practices will not return to their pre-pandemic norms. Lloyds Banking Group says it plans to shed 20% of its office space. Earlier this week, HSBC said it would get rid of 40%. These figures are so dramatic that they invite suspicion. Have managements really come to the firm view that working from home is so popular that employees’ demands for flexibility must be granted? Or did these banks have too much office space in the first place and now wish to save a few quid? Lloyds did its best to promote the cheery interpretation. It cited a survey showing that 77% of its 68,000 employees say they always want to work from home for three or more days a week. OK, but let’s see if those wishes remain fixed and, second, whether managements really play ball. Over at Barclays, the chief executive, Jes Staley, has performed a U-turn. Last April, he was an advocate of the revolution, saying that “putting 7,000 people in a building may be thing of the past”, but now he’s not so sure about working from home. “It’s remarkable it’s working as well as it is, but I don’t think it’s sustainable,” he said last month. Over in the US, Jamie Dimon at JP Morgan has sounded similarly sceptical, arguing that “culture, character, learning, you can’t do a lot of that remotely”. That feels intuitively correct: the impact on productivity emerges slowly. One can see why bosses feel the need to say something – employees want hints – but one suspects commitments at this stage should be taken with a pinch of salt. Lloyds cannot know if, when offices reopen, 77% will still want to stay away. Would meetings work if half the participants are in the room and half on Zoom? Will turning up be perceived as career enhancing? Some changes, no doubt, will be permanent. But it feels extremely premature to say you will close 20% or 40% of your space – unless you had already half-intended to do so. Ex-Reckitt Benckiser chief’s incentive package now looks ridiculous Rakesh Kapoor was paid the astonishing total of £97m during the course of his eight years as chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser, the Dettol-to-Durex consumer goods group, so he must have bequeathed a golden inheritance when he left in 2019, right? Well, no. The flagship deal of Kapoor’s reign – the $18bn purchase in 2017 of Mead Johnson’s baby milk formula business – has gone from sour to worse. Reckitt’s full-year numbers on Wednesday revealed a £945m impairment charge added to last year’s heftier whack. To cap it all, the China part of the acquired business has now been placed under “strategic review” by his successor, Laxman Narasimhan, corporate-speak for “available for sale at a knock-down price”. The US part of the infant business is doing better, and the European end is so-so. But Kapoor, back in 2017, banged on about the opportunities in China to explain why he was abandoning Reckitt’s long-standing tradition of small bolt-on deals. In the event, almost every assumption about the Chinese market has turned out to be wrong. After a series of scandals, the locals now trust their own cheaper brands; trade with Hong Kong has disappointed; and Reckitt overestimated the Chinese birth rate. The acquisition was an outright mistake. It looks to have been a desperate attempt to buy growth at a moment when Reckitt’s sales machine had stalled. The share price, not by coincidence, peaked just before Kapoor made his splashy acquisition and is now 25% lower, even after last year’s pandemic boost to sales of Dettol and Lysol. As ever, though, it’s too late to apply disinfectant to an incentive package that now looks ridiculous. UK’s uneasy truce with EU over financial services In the context of the UK’s “equivalence” talks with the European Union on financial services, the clearing of financial derivatives is a bigger deal than share trading. The pools of capital are larger, for starters. A sudden shift could also create financial risks, which is why both sides agreed to allow UK clearing houses to clear euro-denominated contracts until June next year. That truce, though, looks fragile. There have reports that Brussels has been prodding EU banks to explain why they aren’t moving more business to the bloc anyway. If true, it would be “a very serious escalation” and of “dubious legality”, Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, told MPs on Wednesday. Bailey will be correct on legality. But his strong words suggest talks on the wider deal are going badly. That is also what the mood music says."
2021-02-24T19:28:22Z,business,Business,McKinsey leader Kevin Sneader ousted after crises,"Partners at the world’s largest consultancy firm, McKinsey, have reportedly ousted their leader, Kevin Sneader, over his handling of a string of controversies during his tenture. The firm’s 650 senior partners voted Sneader out before the final round of a leadership election that was seen as a referendum on his three years in the role, according to the Financial Times. The 54-year-old Scot would be one of the first McKinsey leaders in recent memory to serve only one term – all five of Sneader’s predecessors as global managing partner have served a two terms or more. The influential firm is known for providing expensive advice to governments and multinational companies around the world. Known as the “CEO factory”, McKinsey’s network for former employees includes some of the biggest names in business and politics. Notable alumni include Chelsea Clinton, Facebook’s former chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, and the ex-chief executive of Credit Suisse Tidjane Thiam. In Britain, those who worked or the firm including the politician William Hague, former HSBC chair Lord Green, former city regulator Lord Turner. With 30,000 staff in 65 countries, McKinsey is a go-to consultant for the UK government, and has picked up lucrative contracts during the Covid crisis. Last year, McKinsey consultants were paid £563,000 for six weeks’ work – £14,000 a day – to create a permanent replacement for Public Health England, defining its “vision, purpose and narrative”. But the firm, which has a fondness for mottos such as “Leadership through integrity”, has been stung by a string of crises during Sneader’s leadership. Earlier this month, McKinsey agreed to pay nearly $600m (£426m) to settle a lawsuit brought by 49 US states over its role in helping drug makers sell more prescription painkillers – even as the country faced a nationwide opioid overdose epidemic. The consultancy came under pressure after legal documents revealed that it advised the OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma on how to “turbocharge” sales of the drug in 2013. The firm was found to have encouraged sales representatives to focus on doctors who already prescribed high volumes of OxyContin, and to try to move patients to more potent versions of the drug. Sneader expressed regret after the settlement but stopped short of admitting guilt on McKinsey’s behalf. The company announced two years ago that it would not advise clients on opioid-related business. The blue-chip consultancy has also faced criticism for working with authoritarian regimes. In 2018, the firm said it was “horrified” to learn that a document it produced may have been used to target critics of the Saudi government. McKinsey said it has no evidence that the document, created for internal purposes, was misused. Earlier this month it was one of a number of consultancies named as having received millions from a company embroiled in an Angolan corruption scandal. McKinsey said at the time that an internal investigation found no irregularities.
With Sneader out of the running, McKinsey is likely to be led by one of two senior partners, Bob Sternfels or Sven Smit. Both have reportedly made it to the final round of the election, which is held every three years. A spokesperson for McKinsey did not confirm Sneader’s ousting, but said: “The election, which is conducted by an independent third-party firm, is now under way and we will announce the result after the election concludes.” Sneader’s downfall comes just weeks after the KPMG UK chairman Bill Michael resigned, after telling staff to “stop moaning” during a virtual meeting about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The 52-year-old Australian, who had led the company since 2017, made the comments during a virtual town hall meeting this month that was attended by around a third of the financial services consulting team’s 1,500 staff. Michael told staff to stop “playing the victim card” and described the concept of unconscious bias as being “complete and utter crap for years”. Michael, who was paid £1.7m last year, stepped aside after the accounting company asked the law firm Linklaters to conduct an independent investigation. He later apologised and said the controversy had made his position at the accounting giant “untenable”."

Sterling hit $1.42 against the US dollar for the first time since April 2018, and also touched a one-year high of â‚¬1.17 against the euro. Analysts said the UKâ€™s rapid Covid-19 rollout was lifting the pound, alongside a wider move into riskier assets. Capital Economics predicted it could end the year at $1.45. Shares in holiday firms continued to rebound, with TUI jumping 12% today and cruise operator Carnival gaining 10%. Jet engine maker Rolls-Royce finished the day 5% higher, with commercial property firms British Land (+3.7%) and Land Securities (+4%) also buoyant. The oil price has surged to new 13-month highs, with Brent crude rising about $67 per barrel. Figures showed a sharp fall in US production last week, and a drop in distillate fuel reserves. This sent shares in BP up over 5% by the close of trading. Bitcoin has recovered some ground after its slump on Monday and Tuesday. Itâ€™s currently trading just below $50,000, up 3.8%, after payments firm Square revealed it had bought more. The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, has accused the European Union of pursuing a â€œlocation policyâ€�, as it puts pressure on banks to move activity from Britain to within the EU. Bailey told the Treasury Committee that Brussels was wrong to make banks justify justify why they should not have to shift clearing of euro-denominated derivatives worth billions of euros from London to the EU. â€œIt would be very controversial in my view because legislating extra-territorially is controversial anyway and obviously of dubious legality, frankly.â€� â€œAnd that would be very controversial, frankly.
Baileyâ€™s US counterpart, Fed chair Jerome Powell, has again reassured Congress - and the markets - that monetary policy will remain loose for some time. Powell told lawmakers that it may take more than three years to reach the Federal Reserveâ€™s inflation goals. Stocks pushed higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average hitting a fresh record high -- with investors also welcoming the prospect that Johnson & Johnsonâ€™s one-shot Covid vaccine could get emergency approval in the US soon.

2021-02-24T16:59:28Z,business,Business,Lloyds embraces hybrid working with 20% cut in office space,"Lloyds Banking Group is to reduce its office space by 20% over the next two years, as working from home becomes a permanent lifestyle change. The decision was taken after 77% of Lloyds’ 68,000 employees said they wanted to work from home for three or more days a week in the future. The bank’s chief financial officer, William Chalmers, said it would make sure offices offered more space for teamwork rather than areas where staff sit at their desks alone. A number of City institutions have announced similar plans as they adapt to hybrid working. HSBC is reducing its office footprint by nearly 40% as part of cost cuts designed to capitalise on the success of remote working. Metro Bank also confirmed it was in the process of cutting its office space by roughly a third and planned to place staff in some of its branches. Lloyds’ chief executive, António Horta-Osório, said hybrid working could attract a broader pool of talent, including younger workers, who want a “better way of combining their personal preferences with their work obligations”. The announcement came as Lloyds revealed a 72% drop in annual pre-tax profits to £1.2bn for 2020, after it was forced to put aside £4.2bn to protect itself from a potential jump in defaults linked to the Covid crisis. Profits were also hit by lower interest rates, which reduced revenue. Lloyds still paid its outgoing boss £3.4m in 2020, however, despite waiving a bonus worth as much as £1.8m in light of the pandemic. That is the chief executive’s lowest payout since 2012, when he earned a similar sum. Seventeen Lloyds bankers earned more than €1m (£860,000) last year, despite staff bonuses having been cancelled in December. Bankers shared a bonus pot worth £310m in 2019. Lloyds unexpectedly announced on Wednesday that it would pay each permanent staff member £400 worth of shares that will vest in three years’ time. The bank said it was in recognition of their work in 2020 and would ensure staff had a “personal interest in the longer-term success of the group”. Chalmers said formal bonuses were likely to restart this year as the economy recovered from the pandemic. “Our performance unfortunately fell short of our required targets for bonus payouts during the course of 2020,” he said.
“But it’s important to note that we expect that to turn around during the course of 2021 … That would be consistent with us resuming bonus payments and we very much look forward to doing so.” Lloyds also announced that it was resuming dividend payments, with plans to pay shareholders a combined £404m at 0.57p per share. The Bank of England lifted a ban on paying dividends in December, which was imposed last year and designed to give banks a larger cash cushion to weather the Covid crisis. The lender, which is preparing for a change in leadership, confirmed that the HSBC banker Charlie Nunn would take over as chief executive on 16 August, three and a half months after Horta-Osório formally steps down on 30 April. Chalmers will act as chief executive in the interim."
2021-02-24T16:30:03Z,business,Business,The jobseeker increase is pathetic – and so is the spin to justify the paltry amount | Greg Jericho,"Predictably, the increase to jobseeker was miserable. Equally predictable and miserable was the spin used to justify the paltry amount. On Tuesday the government announced that it would raise the base rate of the jobseeker allowance by $25 a week. The government phrased it as $50 a fortnight, and everyone else quickly worked out it was just $3.57 a day extra which is ... well ... not much. A more accurate way to think of it is as a $100-a-fortnight cut, because the Covid-19 bonus payment of $150 is to end at the end of March and will now be replaced with a $50 increase. But of course the government does not wish anyone to think of it that way because that $150 bonus (which itself had been cut from an initial $550) was intended to be, in Scott Morrison’s words, a “short-term emergency measure”.
It was needed because, the prime minister told reporters on Tuesday, the pandemic meant “the social safety net that we had would soon become overwhelmed by the level of demand that would be placed upon that”. Except that argument is complete drivel. A correctly set safety net does not get “overwhelmed”. Rather it absorbs extra people, allows them to survive while looking for work and also acts as an automatic stabiliser so the economy doesn’t go the way of the Great Depression. What Morrison was really saying is that the previous base rate of $282.50 a week was completely unfit for purpose – and it was politically untenable to have 800,000 extra people suddenly discover just how unfit. But that was then. Now most of those people have gone back to some form of work and so the government can return to treating the unemployed with the contempt it always has – including increased mutual obligations and employer dob-in call lines just to ensure they feel suitably dehumanised. But there had also been a loud call for the rate to be raised, and so politically something needed to be done. I suspect a $50-a-fortnight increase was the bare minimum they were able to do that could be spun as at least sounding significant without actually being so. Yet Morrison suggested there was some science behind it. He told the media that it “puts the jobseeker payment at 41.2% of the national minimum wage, which is commensurate with what it was during the time of the Howard government”. He then repeated: “This brings it up from 37.5% up to 41.2%. That is commensurate with where it sat during the period of the Howard government.” But is it though? Yes, the old rate was 37.5% of the minimum wage, and yes, $310.40 is 42.2% of the minimum wage of $753.80 a week, but that was hardly the level “during the time of the Howard government”. More correctly it was the level right at the end of the Howard government:
Graph not displaying? Click here In 1997, when the Howard government fully abandoned indexing unemployment benefits with earnings, Newstart was 44.7% of the minimum wage. If it had remained at that level, the jobseeker rate would now be $337.15 – some $54 higher than the current rate and still $26 higher than the new rate:
Graph not displaying? Click here But the problem is since 1997 the minimum wage has also declined in value compared with average earnings:
Graph not displaying? Click here Using the minimum wage as the benchmark thus ensures jobseeker will also fall well behind average earnings:
Graph not displaying? Click here When the Howard government came into power in 1996, Newstart was worth 20.6% of the average male full-time weekly earnings; by the end of 2007 it was down to 17.5%; now it is 14.9%. Morrison is more than happy to use average full-time earnings when selling the government’s high income tax cuts. He told parliament that the tax cuts would mean “if you are on the average full-time earnings you are not on the second highest tax bracket”, and that “Australian workers pay on average in their wages some 23.8%. That is what the average full-time wage earner in Australia pays across their entire income.” So if average full-time earnings are good enough when he is trying to sell tax cuts, let them also be good enough when trying to gauge the worth of the jobseeker increase. If jobseeker was at the ratio to average full-time earnings it was in 1997 when John Howard decided the aged pension should be linked to earnings but Newstart should not be, the current rate would be $383.99 a week – $101 a week higher than now:
Graph not displaying? Click here That puts it just above the current rate with the $150-a-fortnight Covid-bonus payment of $357.85. The $25-a-week increase merely puts the ratio back to around where it was at the end of the Howard years, but no more than that:
Graph not displaying? Click here And so the $25-a-week increase undoes the past decade of decline but leaves the damage done by the Howard years unrepaired. It certainly does not return it back to the level “commensurate with where it sat during the period of the Howard government”. It is a pathetic increase and one that must only be viewed as the start, not the end."
2021-02-24T06:01:01Z,business,Business,Investors warn top UK firms over ethnic and gender diversity,"Investors are turning up the pressure on companies to improve ethnic and gender diversity on their boards ahead of the annual meeting season, according to an influential shareholder adviser. The Investment Association (IA) will issue “amber-top” warnings – the second-highest level of alert – to the biggest 350 listed firms if they do not disclose the ethnic diversity of their boards or have a credible action plan to address the issue. The advisory group, which represents 250 members with £8.5tn under management, is hoping to use the voting power of its members to encourage listed companies to adopt the Parker Review target of having at least one director from an ethnic minority background by the end of 2021. The IA’s institutional voting information service (IVIS), a paid-for service that provides independent information on listed companies, does not make recommendations to investors on how to vote, but uses amber and red tops to highlight areas of concern. Andrew Ninian, the IA’s director for stewardship and corporate governance, said: “The UK’s boardrooms need to reflect the diversity of modern-day Britain. With three-quarters of FTSE-100 companies failing to report the ethnic makeup of their boards in last year’s AGM season, investors are now calling on companies to take decisive action to meet the Parker Review targets.” The group is also seeking greater progress on gender diversity, by giving a red alert to companies with 30% or fewer female directors. This is an increase on last year’s 20% threshold for a red alert.
On executive pay, the group said companies that received government support or raised capital from shareholders during the pandemic should not pay annual bonuses. Many firms have benefited from the government’s furlough scheme or the business loan schemes; and 73 firms of the 600-strong FTSE all-share index raised fresh funds from investors between March and November as the Covid-19 pandemic struck. “Investors also do not generally expect bonuses to be paid if a company has taken government or shareholder support – any company that chooses to do so is expected to provide a clear rationale,” said Ninian. The group also warned remuneration committees not to compensate executives for reduced pay last year by adjusting this year’s pay packages. The climate crisis will be another big focal point. This year, companies in high-risk sectors such as transport, energy, banks, airlines, travel and tourism, which do not comply with reporting standards set by the global Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) will, for the first time, receive an amber alert. Investment managers want to see companies reporting on climate-related risks in a consistent, clear and comparable manner. The UK government intends to make climate-related financial disclosures mandatory by 2025."

More than 2.5 million (or 28%) of those living in London are classed as “living in poverty”, according to government figures. The report shows that 874,354 people in London have assets, including property, worth more than $1m, which makes them so-called “high net worth individuals” (HNWIs). That compares with 820,000 in New York, in second place. Liam Bailey, Knight Frank’s global head of research, said the high cost of housing in the capital had tipped many people into the HNWI category. “The main point is that our HNWI threshold is $1m, so £720,000, and with average house prices in London at £514,000, a lot of households fall into the HNWI category,” he said. “Ironically, the high cost of housing in London is the main driver for categorising so many households as being wealthy.” Bailey dismissed other reports suggesting an exodus from London for the countryside because remote working during lockdowns enables people to base themselves anywhere for work. The research found that London had the most so-called “prime” homes of any city in the world, with more than 68,000 units valued at more than £2m each. There have been a flurry of super-rich property sales during the pandemic as rich overseas investors exploit the drop in the value of the pound and tax advantages thrown as a result of Brexit. London was also named the rich person’s city of choice for lifestyle, according to Knight Frank’s survey of what wealthy people demand from cities such as Michelin-starred restaurants, opera houses and theatres, universities, sports and shopping facilities. London is said to have also benefitted from an influx of rich Hong Kongers, many of whom left the former British colony amid worries about China’s authoritarian clampdown. There was a 68% increase in number of so-called golden visas issued last year to people from Hong Kong promising to invest at least £2m in the UK, according to separate research by the City law firm Bates Wells. London has the highest proportion of people living in low-income households of all regions in the UK, according to Department for Work and Pensions data. Across the capital, 28% of people are said to be “living in poverty” compared with the national average of 22%. That figure rises to 32% for those living in inner London. The data shows that 800,000 – or 39% – of the capital’s children are living in poverty. It is the highest rate of child poverty since the data first started to be collected in 1994. The Knight Frank wealth report shows that despite the economic destruction wrought by the pandemic on millions of people with modest incomes, those who were already very rich have been able to increase their fortunes. More than 6,000 people joined the ranks of the ultra-wealthy last year as those in the top 0.1% were able to increase their already-vast fortunes despite the coronavirus pandemic. The number of ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWIs) – those with assets of more than $30m (£21.3m) – rose by 2.4% last year to 520,000. The UHNWI population is expected to swell by a further 27% to 663,483 by 2025, the report estimates, as huge fortunes are being made in China, Indonesia and India. The number of dollar millionaires is expected to soar by 41% in the same period. “Asia is the key wealth story. The US is, and will remain, the world’s dominant wealth hub over our forecast period, but Asia will see the fastest growth in UHNWIs over the next five years,” Bailey said. “China is key to this phenomenon with 246% forecast growth in very wealthy residents in the decade to 2025.”
The report found that a person living in the UK would need a $1.8m (£1.3m) fortune to join the so-called 1% club of the richest people in the country. In Monaco, where many of the world’s richest people live to avoid income taxes, a fortune of $7.9m is needed to join the top 1%. In Switzerland it is $5.1m. While in the US it is $4.4m, in Kenya the figure is $20,000.
The world’s richest people are worried that growing inequality could lead governments to impose wealth taxes, with the prospect of such a levy listed in the report as their biggest fear after coronavirus. Such taxes have been introduced in Argentina, Bolivia and Morocco. In the UK, three prominent economists, including an adviser to the Treasury, have recommended the introduction of a one-off tax on anyone with more than £500,000 in assets, including property. The Wealth Tax Commission suggests a 1% tax on those individuals for five years could raise £260bn – enough to cover the full cost of funding the NHS for a year."
2021-02-23T22:30:40Z,business,Business,A demerger is HSBC's only way to solve its Hong Kong problem,"A new (ish) chief executive is at the helm of HSBC, so it’s time for another bout of corporate introspection. “We’re going to stop trying to be everything to everyone,” says Noel Quinn. Was that – finally – a recognition that life as a socially responsible UK-regulated bank is impossible to square with the commercial necessity to dance to Beijing’s tune when Hong Kong’s last freedoms are being squashed? Actually, no. Quinn’s version of HSBC’s longstanding “pivot to Asia” strategy was merely about shedding retail banking operations in the US and France. The UK operation is staying put, apparently. For good measure, he added an ode to the joys of the soulless Canary Wharf. Well, maybe, but the dual-headed London/Hong Kong structure is hard to trust for the long term. Yes, as Quinn told a UK parliamentary committee last month, all banks have to comply with the laws where they operate, but it was still shocking to see Peter Wong, HSBC’s top executive in Asia, sign a public petition last year in support of Beijing’s draconian security laws. Tensions between China and the west seem likely only to intensify with Joe Biden’s arrival in the White House, meaning HSBC is more exposed than ever to political blasts. About 90% of the profits come from Asia, so nobody should be under any illusions about the bank’s priorities if push comes to shove. The question is if, or when, the board feels a split is inevitable. Quinn and Mark Tucker, the chairman, clearly want to cling to the current setup as long as possible, and one can understand the temptation to sit tight and hope for the best. A demerger of the old Midland Bank that was bought in 1992 (and could be rebranded as First Direct for today’s world) would be a dramatic move. But note also Quinn’s reference to how “the Covid-19 pandemic and the impact of geopolitics weighed heavily on our share price throughout 2020”. Take the latter to be an admission that a “Hong Kong discount” sits on HSBC’s valuation, which is clearly the case. An effective cut in the dividend won’t improve the mood and, unless things improve soon, one suspects shareholders, rather than western politicians, will demand reform to clear the political fog. The UK bank is ringfenced already and should be worth £10bn at a bare minimum. Demerger is the obvious next pivot. Where are the female CEOs and chairs? What’s the best way to get more women into boardrooms of big public companies? The debate five years ago was whether voluntary targets would improve the scandalous level of under-representation, or whether quotas were needed. The UK took the voluntary route and, credit where it’s due, the aim of 33% female representation on FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 boards, as set by the 2016 Hampton-Alexander review, has been achieved. Not by every company, of course, but the average for the FTSE 350 has risen from 21.9% in October 2015 to 34.3% in January 2021. And the number of “one and done” boards has fallen from 116 to 16. A few countries that took the quota route (France, Sweden, Norway and Italy) score better. Equally, some quota countries (the Netherlands, Spain and Germany) sit lower. Yet the big-picture headline numbers for the UK obscure an uncomfortable fact: the number of female chief executives and chairs remains tiny. There are only eight female chief executives of FTSE 100 companies, a net gain of only two since 2017. And the low representation in the chair’s job – an increase from six to 11 – is almost more shocking because the role is usually a non-executive one and the increase in female non-executives has contributed most to the overall tally. There are more women in the boardroom but it seems they’re not getting the top posts. The final Hampton-Alexander report urges improvement but is short on explanation for the failures. On the chair point, here’s the candid view of one woman who has served on a few FTSE 350 boards. First, there is a clue when companies use phrases such as “credibility in dealing with complex stakeholder situations” in their job adverts. The subliminal message, as she puts it, is: “Are you a man who will dominate a room?” Second, chief executives have an effective right of veto over the appointment of a chair and a significant proportion of the men probably still don’t want to work for a woman. Depressing – but also probably accurate."
2021-02-23T22:30:40Z,business,Business,Number of FTSE 100 female directors rises by 50% in five years,"The number of female directors at FTSE-100 firms has increased by 50% in the last five years, and women now hold more than a third of roles in the boardrooms of Britain’s top 350 companies, according to the final report of a review into female representation at the top of business. Although men still dominate the top ranks of business, the government-backed Hampton-Alexander review has achieved its target of 33% of board positions at FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 firms being held by women by the end of 2020. The review was launched in 2016 with the aim of encouraging UK-listed companies to promote more women to their boards and into senior leadership positions. On 11 January women held 34.3% of board roles across the FTSE 350, according to data gathered by BoardEx, up from 30.6% in 2019. The number of women on the boards of those companies has risen from 682 to 1,026 during the five years of the Hampton-Alexander review, named after the two business people appointed to lead the inquiry at the time of its launch – Sir Philip Hampton, a former chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland and GlaxoSmithKline, and the late Dame Helen Alexander, a former chief executive of the Economist. However, the review has fallen slightly short of its second goal of reaching 33% representation of women in FTSE 350 leadership teams. The proportion of women in those leadership roles – who have places on an executive committee or directly report to the executive committee – reached 29.4%, up from 28.2% a year earlier. Although Hampton-Alexander targets have always been voluntary, almost two-thirds of FTSE 350 companies (63%) have reached the goal of 33% of board positions held by women. A number of firms have exceeded gender equality targets, including drinks company Diageo, maker of Guinness and Smirnoff, and water company Severn Trent. Both firms have more women represented on their board than men, a first for the leading FTSE 100 index, with 60% female representation at Diageo, and 55.6% at Severn Trent. Severn Trent is also part of a select group of four companies in the FTSE 350 which have both a female chief executive and chair. Fellow water company Pennon Group, and the insurance firms Admiral Group and Direct Line Insurance Group are also led by two women. However, there are still 16 companies out of 350 which only have one woman on their board, so-called “one and done” businesses, although this is a vast improvement on the 116 companies which only had one female board member in October 2015. Sir Philip Hampton, chair of the review, hailed the “excellent progress for women leaders in business” over the last decade, but he warned that businesses need to recruit and promote women to top executive roles “to sustain the changes made”. There is a “full to overflowing” supply of capable and experienced women, said Denise Wilson, chief executive of the review. “It is now for business to fully utilise a talent pool of educated, experienced women, to their own benefit and that of the UK economy,” Wilson said. Despite the progress made during the five years of the review, progress in female representation at the highest levels of British business remains “fragile and slow”, said Ann Cairns, executive vice-chair of Mastercard and global chair of the 30% Club, which campaigns for at least 30% female representation on boards and executive committees. “There are only 17 female CEOs across all 350 companies,” Cairns said. “Against the backdrop of Covid-19 and its disproportionate impact on women, it’s vitally important for companies to invest in their pipeline of female managers and leaders. Diversity is good for business and it’s key to building back better.”"
2021-02-23T20:19:44Z,business,Business,Shares in UK travel and hospitality firms surge in response to roadmap,"UK travel and hospitality companies set to benefit from the easing of Covid restrictions rallied on the London stock market after Boris Johnson set out the government’s roadmap for ending lockdown in England. Against a backdrop of rising hopes for a rapid economic recovery from the worst recession for more than 300 years, shares in companies among those hardest hit by lockdown, including airlines, travel firms and operators of retail, food and drink outlets at train stations, recorded the biggest gains amid growing hopes for a fast return to relative normality. Shares in airlines and travel firms rose after a surge in holiday bookings on Monday night following Johnson’s announcement of a possible return to international travel from 17 May, subject to a government review. EasyJet said flight bookings from the UK jumped 337% and package holiday bookings surged 630% compared with a week earlier, with Málaga, Alicante and Palma in Spain, Faro in Portugal and the Greek island of Crete among the top destinations. August breaks were the most popular, followed by July and September.
The budget airline ended the day up 4.5%, while the holiday travel firm TUI was up 3.5%. British Airways’ owner International Airlines Group rose by almost 2%. Cineworld gained 9.5% on hopes that cinemas will reopen in mid-May, as outlined by Johnson, while SSP Group soared 17% as investors bet on a pickup in sales at its Upper Crust and Caffè Ritazza stores once holidaymakers and commuters return to airports and railway stations. Bingo specialist Rank Group was up 6%. Amid the prospect of outdoor drinking resuming from mid-April, followed by indoor hospitality from 17 May, shares in the cidermaker C&C Group jumped 9%. Premier Inn owner Whitbread edged closer to reversing stock market losses racked up since the start of the pandemic, while pub chain JD Wetherspoon also reached levels last seen a year ago. Property companies with big office and retail assets were also in demand. British Land, the company behind shopping centres such as Meadowhall and Drake Circus and offices such as Broadgate in the City, was the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, up more than 5%. Land Securities, which has London office developments and the Bluewater mall, was up more than 4%. The government is reviewing whether to change its work-from-home guidelines from June. Richard Morawetz, a vice-president at the rating agency Moody’s, said the gradual easing of restrictions – assuming there is no reversal – would boost earnings for companies that rely more on free movement, such as tourism, retail and leisure activities. “This will be reinforced by the rollout of the vaccination programme, which will boost consumer confidence and consumption in the sectors that have been most affected by lockdowns,” he said. The lockdown winners stood out on an otherwise mixed day for the financial markets; the FTSE 100 rose by 0.2% to reach 6,625, while the more domestically-focused FTSE 250 rose by 0.4% to 21,057. The pound rose by 0.3% against the dollar to trade above $1.41 for the first time in almost three years, fuelled by optimism over the UK’s vaccination programme and hopes for a faster economic recovery. Meanwhile, on Wall Street, shares in large tech companies slid amid fears that valuations had risen too far after a stellar performance in the past year, and as the prospect of higher inflation looms as the world economy recovers from Covid-19. Tesla was among the biggest fallers, dropping 11% at one point but ending the day down just over 2%. Its shares were dragged down further by a slide in the value of bitcoin because of the carmaker’s $1.5bn bet on the cryptocurrency announced earlier this month. Bitcoin has plunged by about 20% in less than two days, dropping below $50,000 from a record high of $58,000 on Sunday.
Testifying at Congress Jerome Powell, the chair of the US Federal Reserve, struck a cautious note over the prospects for the world’s largest economy and said support from the central bank was still needed as it emerged from the pandemic. That promise of support cheered investors and markets recovered some of their earlier losses. Sean Darby, global equity strategist at the US bank Jefferies, said the UK government’s reopening plans represented “much further progress” than most other economies that the bank analyses. “As pressure on the healthcare system abates there may be room for a faster relaxation in social restrictions thereby allowing some of the worst areas of the economy and UK market to rebound.”"
2021-02-23T19:04:04Z,business,Business,Swedish alt-milk brand Oatly seeks $10bn US stock market listing,"Fashionable Swedish alt-milk brand Oatly is seeking a US stock market listing that could value the business at as much as $10bn (£7.1bn). Malmö-based Oatly is riding high as global demand for plant-based milk alternatives soars. The flotation follows last summer’s sale of a minority stake to a starry group of investors that included US private equity firm Blackstone, Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z. That deal valued the company at $2bn. On Tuesday, Oatly said it had submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The number of shares being sold and price range is yet to be decided, it said in the short statement. Oatly has enjoyed stratospheric growth thanks to the combination of guerrilla marketing and good timing, as more people embrace a vegan or vegetarian diet.Its sales nearly doubled to $200m in 2019 and were predicted to do the same in 2020. Although founded in the early 1990s, Oatly was little known outside Sweden until the arrival of Toni Petersson as chief executive in 2012. The entrepreneur has made the brand standout with the pitch that oat milk is better for the planet than cow’s milk.
When one first-time drinker declared “it tastes like shit!” the company printed the view on its cartons. Petersson has also appeared in its ads, including one where he is standing in a field with a synthesiser, singing “Wow, no cow!” over and over. More recently though the brand has faced a backlash from climate and political activists for the presence of Blackstone, headed by Trump donor Stephen Schwartzman, on its share register. The recipe for Oatly was created by Prof Rickard Öste who co-founded the company with his brother Björn. Öste’s patents underpin the manufacturing process and the academic remains the company’s head of science."
2021-02-23T18:02:06Z,business,Business,"UK jobless rate hits 5.1%; reopening hopes lift leisure stocks, but tech slides – as it happened","Time for a recap. Unemployment in the UK has hit its highest level in almost five years, as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to hit the labour market. The jobless rate hit 5.1% in the October-December quarter, with over 1.7m people now out of work and looking for a job. But with the number of people on payrolls rising again, the labour market may be stabilising. Economists warned that the data didn’t cover the full scale of unemployment, with many jobs being protected by the furlough scheme. Unemployment is expected to keep rising, to perhaps 6.5% by the end of the year, putting pressure on the government to extend the furlough job retention scheme. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that every job lost was a personal tragedy, pledging to set out the next stage of the government’s Plan for Jobs in next week’s budget. But his Labour opposite number, Anneliese Dodds, said the chancellor had helped create the jobs crisis by waiting too long to extend the furlough scheme last autumn.
In the City, shares in property firms, hospitality chains and travel companies have jumped after the government outlined its plans to reopen the UK economy over the next few months.
Optimism over the prospect of an economic revival this year has also lifted the pound to a new three-year high against the US dollar, at above $1.41. Technology stocks are under pressure, though, amid fears that rising inflation will force central banks to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. Electric car maker Tesla slumped by 9% at one stage, taking a dent out of Elon Musk’s fortune.
The wider Nasdaq Composite is down over 2.3% now, having hits its lowest level since the end of January. Bitcoin also tumbled, dropping 15% to around $47,100 right now after a parabolic surge in recent weeks. US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has tried to calm market nerves by insisting that it will take time to repair the US economy. He told the Senate Finance Committee that: “The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved.”
And in another sign of Covid-19’s impact, HSBC is to reduce its office space around the world by nearly 40%. It’s part of sweeping cost cutting designed to capitalise on new part-office-part-homeworking arrangements after the pandemic.

2021-02-23T17:46:32Z,business,Business,Fed chair warns US economic recovery 'uneven and far from complete',"The US economic recovery “remains uneven and far from complete”, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell told a committee of US senators Tuesday. In his semi-annual update on monetary policy, his first delivered under Joe Biden’s presidency, Powell indicated the Fed would not be changing monetary policy any time soon, given the slow recovery in the labor market.
Powell told the Senate banking committee of his concern that millions of Americans are out of work, particularly those who are already members of vulnerable communities. “The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit,” Powell said. “The job losses were heavily concentrated on public-facing, service-sector jobs. Those tend to be more skewed towards lower-paid, and in many cases, minorities and women.” He noted that job losses seem to be “somehow precisely aimed at those people, and we’re well aware of that”. The chairman echoed concerns raised by the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, that labor participation rates are lower than pre-pandemic levels. Both economists have said that the official 6.3% unemployment rate is deceivingly low given that so many Americans are not actively looking for work and are thus not counted in the official unemployment rate. “Published unemployment rates during Covid have dramatically understated the deterioration in the labor market,” Powell said in remarks made earlier this month, noting that the unemployment rate that counts those who are not looking for work would be closer to 10%. Speaking at an event on Monday, Yellen said that 10 million Americans are officially counted as unemployed while another 4 million have dropped out of the labor force. Working mothers of young children have seen a particularly sharp drop in labor participation over the course of the pandemic, according to a recent report from the Minneapolis federal reserve. During Powell’s testimony, Republicans pushed the chairman to address their concerns that Biden’s $1.9tn economic stimulus plan, which Democrats are trying to push through Congress this week, will lead to high inflation. Powell, as he has done in recent weeks, downplayed their concerns over aid sparking inflation. “This is not a problem for this time, as near as I can figure,” Powell said, noting that the Federal Reserve has tools to challenge rising inflation rates should they be seen. Powell emphasized the top priority for reviving the economy should be to continue vaccination efforts, which “offer hope for a return to more normal conditions later this year”. The chairman is expected to testify again tomorrow before the House financial services committee."
2021-02-23T16:52:44Z,business,Business,HSBC to slash post-Covid office space by 40% as profits drop by a third,"HSBC is to reduce its office space around the world by nearly 40% as part of sweeping cost cutting designed to capitalise on new part-office-part-homeworking arrangements after the pandemic. The decision to move to new hybrid working arrangements was announced as HSBC confirmed it was accelerating its pivot towards Asia, including China and Hong Kong, despite concerns about the political crackdown in the former British colony.
Executives said on Tuesday that the success of remote working meant the bank could cut down on business travel and reduce its office footprint by nearly 40% over the next few years. The bank’s chief executive, Noel Quinn, said he was committed to keeping the bank’s London’s Canary Wharf head office, but that HSBC would probably shed offices elsewhere in the capital, as they came up for lease renewal. Staff will then be squeezed into less space though they will also work from home. “The nature of working within our offices will change to have a higher occupancy per square foot, because we’ll have a hybrid style of working,” Quinn said. HSBC has 66 offices in the UK, at least 10 of which are in London, according to its annual report. The exercise will be made easier by widespread job cuts that reduced its headcount by 11,000 last year. Around 17% of senior managers were made redundant. Chief operating officer John Hinshaw told analysts that there were also opportunities to cut back-office roles, including a third of the bank’s 7,000-strong finance division. HSBC is expected to cut up to 35,000 jobs as part of its cost-cutting plans. HSBC said it was also cutting the bonus pool for its bankers by 20% to $2.7bn (£1.9bn) after the lender recorded a 34% drop in profit for 2020 to $8.8bn (£7.6bn). The bank put aside $8.8bn to cover a potential jump in loan defaults linked to the pandemic.
But HSBC still managed to hand out bumper pay packets to many senior bankers. According to its annual report, 324 bankers were paid more than €1m (£863,000) last year, while eight were paid over €5m. One unnamed HSBC banker was handed between €9m-10m, roughly double the £4.2m paid to the chief executive for 2020. Quinn waived his cash bonus in light of the pandemic, but still earned a share bonus worth £799,000. The chief executive donated a quarter of his £1.3m base salary, leaving him with about £3.8m in total pay. The London-headquartered lender announced it would resume dividend payments despite the drop in profits, with plans to pay shareholders a combined $3.1bn at 15 cents per share. It came after the Bank of England ended a temporary ban that forced HSBC to scrap a $4.2bn payment to shareholders last spring. That ban was lifted – with limits – in December.
HSBC’s London-listed shares fell 1.3% to 426p on Tuesday afternoon.The lender also confirmed it was doubling down on its operations in Asia, where it makes the vast majority of its profits. HSBC’s Asian business reported $12.8bn in profits in 2020, easily offsetting the $4.2bn loss logged in Europe.
The bank is planning to invest a further $6bn in Asia over the next five years, including in Hong Kong and China. It is pressing ahead despite facing criticism in the west for ignoring threats to local democracy, supporting China’s controversial security law, and freezing the accounts of protesters who critics claim are the real target of Beijing’s crackdown. Quinn confirmed he was considering shifting more of his top executives to Hong Kong. “I think it is important for some of the executive team to be closer to the growth opportunities, particularly those in frontline roles serving the global businesses,” he said. However, he stressed that HSBC was not abandoning the west, and was still committed to its London headquarters. “The vast majority of my senior executive roles will remain based here in London, including myself,” Quinn added."
2021-02-23T16:41:23Z,business,Business,Workers’ rights and role of trade unions,"Your editorial (21 February) on Amazon workers’ rights and Nesrine Malik’s article (The culture war isn’t harmless rhetoric, it’s having a chilling effect on equality, 22 February) mention new trade unions fighting for the rights of low-paid workers: the App Drivers & Couriers Union, which won the landmark court case against Uber, and the United Voices of the World union, which represents migrant workers. There is also the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, supporting low-paid workers who make up the gig economy. The need for these new unions raises the question of the role of the Trades Union Congress and the big, wealthy unions. Where were they when the gig economy was exploding? David Kennedy Ilkley, West Yorkshire • Why hasn’t the law already been strengthened so that “gig workers may also have access to sick pay and protection from unfair dismissal” (Report, 19 February)? While Citizens Advice says that if you work part-time or on a fixed-term contract, or are a casual worker on a zero-hours contract, you are entitled to statutory sick pay, workers don’t get sick pay for the first three days they’re sick, likely the key days for Uber drivers.

2021-02-23T16:30:33Z,business,Business,'Starvation payments': jobseeker recipients say new rate puts a normal life out of reach,"Twenty-eight-year-old Gene Saraçi, who has been unemployed for four years, says he was “heartbroken” listening to Scott Morrison explain the government’s decision to increase jobseeker payments by just $3.57 a day. “It just definitely demonstrates that this government has absolutely no concern or compassion towards people that are unemployed or underemployed. “It effectively reduces me to a situation where I don’t see much hope in terms of financial independence and self-sustainability.” Saraçi, who describes himself as a freelance photographer, said he had just moved into a home in Geelong, Victoria prior to the pandemic, after being homeless for about a year. The pandemic supplement, which was $550 a fortnight before it was reduced to $150 this year, allowed him to set up his home. “I was able to buy furniture, I was able to lift my quality of life. It was just the basic minimum standard that we expect and are entitled to as citizens.
“I felt accepted, and that there was some hope. But now it feels like I’ve been set back years in progress because they’ve decided, well, too bad so sad. “It’s dehumanising. It feels like I’m not welcome or included in this society for the pure fact that I am not economically viable enough to be a part of it.” The government’s modest increase, taking the base rate to $620.80 a fortnight, or $44.35 a day, will still be less than the current jobseeker payment of $715 a fortnight, which includes a $150 pandemic supplement. Morrison said on Tuesday ending the coronavirus supplement at the end of March was a necessary change as the vaccination program begins rolling out. The prime minister said the increased benefit would lift the rate to 41.2% of the national minimum wage, which would keep the jobseeker payment below the poverty line. He described the new jobseeker rate as fulfilling a “social contract” with the Australian people – an idea Saraçi balked at. “It absolutely crushes me to see the prime minister brag on about the social contract they hold with Australians, whilst also neglecting their end of the deal.” Joshua Badge, an academic and writer based in Melbourne, told the Guardian they actually decided not to stay on the jobseeker program late last year, when their partner returned to work, as the rate was too low. “The way that the government calculates that meant that my payment was effectively wiped out. So I received as little as $11 a fortnight.” Badge said Tuesday’s announcement was a paltry sum when compared to the amount necessary to alleviate poverty around the country. “What is someone supposed to do with an extra $3 a day? It wouldn’t even pay for a bottle of water in the supermarket, let alone pay for the meals you are skipping. Badge said the unemployment benefits they received prior to the pandemic had left them “miserable” and unable to live the life they wanted. “Those payments were starvation payments. “It was just miserable, it’s not really living in the way most people imagine. You’d constantly have to say no to yourself.” Mike Sadler, 60, is studying to be a teacher having been on unemployment benefits for several years due to a severe back injury.
He told the Guardian he “felt the pit of my stomach dropping” during Tuesday’s press conference. “It makes me feel like a failure, there’s just a limit to what I can do.” Sadler said losing the pandemic supplement would mean he and his family would return to a more difficult life. “We go back to hunker in the bunker mode. “We moved to Wagga, and what that meant was that if we sat at home, watched the telly, no Netflix, we could just exist. If nothing went wrong, we were fine. I could put food on the table. “But that’s it. As soon as anything went wrong, or any bill came along, we were stuffed. It’s a constant feeling of dread, like you’re under the hammer.” Avery Howard, a student who also receives the youth allowance payment, said they were furious about the modest increase. “Just hearing what they had to say, and the vitriol they have for the unemployed, along with hearing about this cut, just left me speechless. “It’ll make it more difficult to buy groceries. That is where most of my money will now go. It’s already difficult, but it just will make it more difficult. I have no way of saving up for anything. “I’ll continue to just barely scrape by. It will be incredibly difficult for me, it’s basically a kick in the face when you’re already down. “They had the opportunity to give us the dignity that we deserve, and yet they continue to push us further and then tell us it’s our fault because we’re not finding work.” Howard said the coronavirus supplement introduced last year had allowed them to live a relatively normal life, able to afford health bills and fresh vegetables. “It sort of allowed me to feel dignity, it helped in some ways with my self-worth, because I didn’t have to keep worrying about every dollar and cent and where everything was going to. “It feels like the government just isn’t there for us.” Kristin O’Connell, spokesperson for the Australian Unemployed Workers’ Union (AUWU), said the new rate was not enough to lift people out of poverty. “This cut means people can’t eat regularly, it means people can’t secure a place to live, it means people will go years without appropriate healthcare, and these are absolutely basics. “The government is forcing people to live in poverty, and they do not have to do this. They have shown they can lift millions of people out of poverty overnight.” The AUWU had been advocating for a lift in the unemployment benefit to above the poverty line, which roughly translates to $80 a day. “It’s a simple choice for the government, to allow us to live with dignity and to keep everyone above the poverty line.”"
2021-02-23T15:09:28Z,business,Business,Gordon Ramsay: my restaurants are £60m down thanks to Covid,"Gordon Ramsay has suffered his own kitchen nightmare during the pandemic with his restaurant empire missing out on nearly £60m of trade. The celebrity chef said that in December his 35 UK restaurants had £10m worth of reservations “wiped out overnight” when coronavirus restrictions were reimposed. “As of 19 March to 3 February this year we’ve suffered £57.5m worth of turnover down,” said Ramsay. “I’m in it.” Ramsay has 18 restaurants in London including Pétrus, Bread Street Kitchen and Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, as well as a further 17 worldwide. In 2019, the businessman replaced his Maze Grill venue in Mayfair with Asian-themed Lucky Cat. The chef, who is presenting new BBC quizshow Bank Balance, said his company had used the government’s furlough scheme to preserve hundreds of jobs at the group.
“Lockdowns have caused utter devastation,” he told the Sun. “Having been through so much with the 2008 financial crash, then terrorist attacks and 9/11, when Covid first hit, we all thought it would be over and done with in a couple of weeks. But it’s been long haul.” The last set of accounts for Gordon Ramsay Restaurants, which were filed in September 2020, show a pretax profit of £15.2m on sales of £54.7m in 2019. The pandemic has had a “significant impact” on the group’s finances, said the group’s chief executive, Andy Wenlock, in a note to the accounts. It had negotiated rent concessions with landlords and secured additional bank funding and anticipated being able to meet its liabilities for at least 12 months."
2021-02-23T14:15:16Z,business,Business,Holiday bookings surge in UK after lockdown exit plans revealed,"Airlines and travel companies have reported a surge in holiday bookings after the Boris Johnson announced his roadmap out of lockdown. EasyJet, Ryanair, Tui and Thomas Cook reported a jump in bookings to destinations including Spain and Greece after the prime minister said international trips could potentially resume from 17 May, subject to review and assuming there was no resurgence in coronavirus and vaccination programmes went well. The increase bolstered shares in airlines and travel companies on Tuesday. EasyJet and Tui were among the top risers on the FTSE 250, up 7% and 3% respectively. On the FTSE 100, British Airways’ owner International Airlines Group, was up 3.5%.
EasyJet said flight bookings from the UK jumped 337% and package holiday bookings surged 630% compared with a week earlier, with Málaga, Alicante and Palma in Spain, Faro in Portugal and the Greek island of Crete among the top destinations. August breaks are the most popular, followed by July and September. Johan Lundgren, the easyJet chief executive, said: “We have consistently seen that there is pent-up demand for travel and this surge in bookings shows the signal from the government that it plans to reopen travel has been what UK consumers have been waiting for.” Tui, Ryanair, Thomas Cook and Jet2holidays also reported a sharp rise in demand. Tui, the world’s largest travel company, said breaks in Greece, Spain and Turkey from July onwards were the most booked overnight, with bookings up 500%. Ryanair, Europe’s biggest airline, said there had been a “large surge” in bookings from the UK to holiday destinations in Spain, Greece and Italy since the government’s announcement. “This is an encouraging trend and shows the importance of providing customer confidence,” a spokesperson said. As part of the government’s planned easing of Covid-19 restrictions, Boris Johnson said a travel taskforce would set out plans on 12 April on the return to international travel “so people can plan for the summer”. The ban on international travel will not be lifted until 17 May at the earliest, however, which means Easter breaks are off the table. Andrew Flintham, the managing director of Tui UK and Ireland, said: “The announcement from the prime minister was positive and shows that by working with the travel industry on a risk-based framework our customers will have the opportunity to travel abroad this summer. We will continue to work closely with the government so people can look forward to a well-deserved break away, after what has been a very difficult year for many.” Thomas Cook said website traffic was up by 75% on Monday and bookings tripled from the day before. Turkey was the No 1 destination followed by Greece and Cyprus, but people also booked long-haul breaks to Dominican Republic and Mexico. The company said customers were also booking well into 2022. “It felt like the cork had popped on all that pent-up demand for holidays,” a spokesperson said. The tour operator Jet2holidays and the Jet2 carrier said summer bookings had leapt 600% since Monday afternoon, compared with this time last week, to mainland Spain and its islands, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and Turkey. There was a noticeable increase in bookings from July through the rest of the school holidays. The Golf Travel Centre, a golf holiday booking website, said it had seen a spike in requests for European golf holidays in June and July.
The Thomas Cook chief executive, Alan French, said: “The government’s announcement is good news for those of us desperate to get away on holiday. While we await more details, it’s clear that the government’s ambition is to open up international travel in the coming months and hopefully in time for the summer holidays.” Domestic travel has also received a boost. Data from the hotel technology provider Avvio showed a further 38% rise in the value of summer bookings at UK hotels and self-catering accommodation since the announcement, compared with the previous day. It said the high-end UK staycation market was booming, with August revenue for 4- and 5-star hotels up 350% from last year. The Avvio chief commercial officer, Michael De Jongh, said: “We have all had a tough year and people are desperate to get away this summer. Many consumers feel it is too risky to book a foreign holiday, so they are using the money they would have spent going abroad to treat themselves to an incredible stay at a 4- or 5-star hotel in the UK instead. It may well be the first time many of them have stayed in such a high-end hotel.”"

2021-02-23T12:07:20Z,business,Business,Sports Direct owner Frasers warns of £100m Covid writedown,"Frasers Group, the retailer controlled by Sports Direct founder, Mike Ashley, expects to take a hit of more than £100m after the government said non-essential retailers in England would have to wait until 12 April at the earliest to reopen. The group, which includes Sports Direct, House of Fraser and Flannels, said the sum reflected expected writedowns of the value of its properties and other assets. “Given the length of this current lockdown, potential systemic changes to consumer behaviour and the risk of further restrictions in future, we believe this non-cash impairment could be in excess of £100m,” the company said. Only the group’s Evans Cycles bike chain, which is classed as an essential retailer, has been able to trade throughout the high street lockdowns while sportswear retailer Sports Direct, fast-growing designer fashion concept Flannels and struggling House of Fraser department store chain have been affected by government efforts to control the spread of Covid-19. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said the majority of Frasers’ writedown was likely to be linked to House of Fraser but the group’s Sports Direct stores could also be affected. The rise of online shopping, increased competition on the high street and rising rent and tax have put department stores under pressure. Debenhams is about to permanently shut all its 124 remaining outlets, Beales closed all its stores after falling into administration, and John Lewis closed eight stores last year with up to eight more under threat. At least 14 of House of Fraser’s original 59 stores have closed since the department store chain was bought out of administration by the group in 2018 including Frasers on Princes Street in Edinburgh and stores in Exeter, Shrewsbury and Cirencester. It will move out of Edinburgh’s landmark Jenners store on Princes Street after 183 years in May and further stores are expected to close permanently this year.
Laura Hoy, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “With the country’s spirits lifted following the unveiling of the government’s plan to exit lockdown, it’s easy to forget that not everyone is celebrating. Non-essential retailers like Frasers Group certainly aren’t. “Frasers is concerned about ‘systemic changes to consumer behaviour’, and rightly so. Social gatherings, and even the typical workday, could look a lot different after more than a year of disruption – not to mention consumers’ increased preference for e-commerce over high-street shops. “Frasers isn’t facing a cash crunch for the time being, but it will struggle to do much more than stay afloat in the near term. Frasers’ warning is likely a signpost for the sector as a whole: more pain ahead.”"
2021-02-23T10:07:40Z,business,Business,Aboriginal rock shelter in Pilbara damaged after BHP promised not to disturb heritage sites,"A registered Aboriginal site has been damaged at one of BHP’s iron ore mines in the Pilbara less than eight months after the mining giant promised not to disturb any sites in the area without “further deep consultation” with the Banjima traditional owners. The site, a culturally significant rock shelter, was reportedly damaged by a rockfall in late January. It is one of several Banjima sites located in and around BHP’s mining area C near its $4.5bn South Flank iron ore mining operation. BHP said the heritage site was not part of its current mining operations and the cause of the rockfall was not known. The site was first recorded in 2005. The Banjima native title Aboriginal corporation (BNTAC) said BHP wrote to them in late January to say there had been a “rockfall impact” to the site.
In July last year, BHP vowed not to damage 40 Aboriginal heritage sites which it had received ministerial permission to destroy, without “further extensive consultation” with traditional owners. The pledge came after Guardian Australia revealed traditional owners had been legally prevented from speaking publicly about the sites. BHP was given ministerial consent to destroy them under Western Australia’s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws on 29 March, three days after Rio Tinto blew up a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal site at Juukan Gorge, triggering international condemnation. “We will not disturb the sites identified without further extensive consultation with the Banjima people,” a BHP spokesman said at the time. “That consultation will be based on our commitment to understanding the cultural significance of the region and on the deep respect we have for the Banjima people and their heritage.” BHP also announced it would establish a heritage advisory council in partnership with BNTAC. It is this newly established South Flank Heritage Advisory Council that is now investigating what caused the damage to the rock shelter. The council met with BHP executives on 11 February, a BNTAC spokesman said, to “clarify the initial report’s details and progress the investigation”. The investigation is ongoing. BHP’s president of minerals in Australia, Edgar Basto, said he and Western Australia iron ore boss Brandon Craig had met with the Banjima and were “committed to learning from the outcomes of the joint investigation”. “The relationships we hold with the traditional custodians of the land on which we operate are critically important to BHP,” Basto said. “Over many years, we have built a strong relationship with the Banjima people based on deep respect for their heritage and their connection to country. This includes the establishment of the Banjima Heritage Advisory Council last year. We will continue to work with the Banjima in a spirit of respect and cooperation.”"
2021-02-23T08:40:58Z,business,Business,UK jobless figures give mixed messages – but the crunch is coming,"On one reading of the latest unemployment figures, the UK labour market is in pretty good shape. The number of people being added to payrolls is going up and so is the number of job vacancies. Annual earnings growth is up sharply to 4.7%. An alternative reading is that the jobless total is going up along with the redundancy rate, while the number of people employed is going down.
The confusing picture is the result of the Office for National Statistics having a variety of ways of assessing unemployment – the claimant count, the labour force survey and payroll data submitted to HMRC. All are calculated in different ways and some are more timely than others. Parts of the story are relatively easy to understand. The big jump in average earnings growth is largely the result of job losses since the start of the pandemic being concentrated among those on low pay. The average for those that have remained in work – those on higher earnings – has gone up.
Assessing what is happening to jobs is tougher. The HMRC payroll numbers have risen for two months, and while it was possible to put the December increase down to the easing of restrictions following November’s four-week lockdown in England, January involved the reimposition of tough restrictions. While it is hard to imagine why firms would be adding to their payrolls in such circumstances, there are a few reasons why they might have done so. One is that businesses have become savvy when it comes to operating through lockdown. Another is that the January lockdown was accompanied by promising news on vaccines that might have encouraged firms – especially those that have done well during the crisis – to hire more staff. Finally, the government was quick to announce the extension of its furlough scheme, a move that might have persuaded employers that they could hang on until better times arrive. One thing almost every analyst and commentator is agreed on, though, is that the crunch period for the labour market will arrive as the wage subsidies are phased out this year. A clearer picture will then emerge."
2021-02-23T07:49:40Z,business,Business,UK unemployment rises to 5.1% as Covid lockdown freezes economy,"Unemployment in the UK edged higher to 5.1% in December as the government’s furlough scheme continued to prevent a steep rise in job losses in the run-up to Christmas. With much of the economy still in enforced hibernation, the unemployment rate in the three months to December increased from 5% in November and was up by 1.5 percentage points from a year earlier, according to the Office for National Statistics. More recent figures from HM Revenue & Customs for January showed that there were 726,000 fewer people on company payrolls in January compared with February 2020, before the pandemic.
However, annual earnings growth rose sharply to 4.7% in the three months to December, from 3.7% in the three months to November. The ONS said part of the explanation was the fall in the number and proportion of lower paid jobs during the pandemic, suggesting that the average for those that have remained in work, those on higher earnings, went up over the period. Business leaders and anti-poverty campaigners reacted to the figures by warning Rishi Sunak that he must extend the furlough scheme and other measures to prevent businesses from shedding more workers. Tej Parikh, the chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “With restrictions remaining in place over the coming quarters, the chancellor must move quickly to extend the job retention scheme and other Covid-19 economic support beyond the spring.” The Resolution Foundation, an independent thinktank, said the furlough scheme, known formally as the job retention scheme (JRS) and estimated to be supporting about 4.5 million workers, had proved to be invaluable to many firms, but had not stopped huge numbers of people from losing their jobs, especially under-25s. “The importance of the JRS in holding back job losses, coupled with the scale of the crisis facing young people, should be at the forefront of the chancellor’s mind when he delivers his budget next week,” the foundation said. Figures for January also showed that workers aged 24 and under accounted for almost three-fifths of the 726,000 fall in employment since the crisis began.
Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people have also suffered disproportionately from the pandemic, with their unemployment rate rising to 9.5% from 8.5% in the last quarter, compared with a 4.5% unemployment rate for white workers. But HMRC also found that despite the onset of the third lockdown, firms have spent the last two months bringing back some workers to full-time employment. About 83,000 more people were put back on to company payrolls in January compared with December 2020, signalling that some firms were already taking note of the vaccination programme’s initial success and preparing for lockdown restrictions to ease.
The recent rise on payrolls is believed to be the result of firms bringing back staff from furlough, though millions of workers remain on the government subsidy scheme while their jobs are mothballed. More than 1 million self-employed people are also understood to be without work, many of them not eligible for state support. A report by the London School of Economics last month found that one in seven businesses – employing 2.5 million people – might be forced to close by the spring without further support from the Treasury.
Sunak is expected to extend much of the support on offer to workers affected by the pandemic, but is unlikely to expand the scope of benefits to include all self-employed people. Thomas Pugh, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said it was likely the labour market will continue to weaken gradually over the rest of this year, even if the furlough scheme is extended beyond the end of April in next week’s budget. “But a rapid rebound in GDP in the second half of 2021 should prevent the unemployment rate from reaching highs of 8.4% last seen in the 2008 financial crash,” he added."
2021-02-23T06:00:21Z,business,Business,'We need more': businesses on plans to lift England lockdown,"The government has set out a four-step roadmap for relaxing coronavirus restrictions in England, including likely dates for reopening the hard-hit hospitality industry and non-essential retail. Here we gauge the reaction of businesses to a pathway out of the crisis. The pub-restaurant chain Oakman Inns, which operates 28 pub-restaurants and employs 1,000 people across the south of England and the Midlands, has been unable to serve customers in the vast majority of its pubs since mid-December.
Dermot King, Oakman’s chief executive, says he is concerned that with hospitality businesses allowed to serve outside only from 12 April at the earliest, they will be highly reliant on good weather until they can let customers indoors, potentially from 17 May. “There’s no certainty,” he says. Despite the government’s mantra that it will be relying on “data not dates”, he notes, it has not set out any provision to release lockdown earlier should vaccinations and controlling infections go better than expected. King also says the government needs to improve and extend financial help for businesses. “It is untenable and unrealistic to expect businesses to survive without significant help,” he says. “Boris Johnson has been famous in the past for telling business what it can do with itself and he is certainly backing that up as far as hospitality is concerned.” Sarah Butler The nightclub owner
Before the pandemic hit the UK, 24 Kitchen Street – a Liverpool club, music and arts venue – was hosting up to 320 people a night for events ranging from hip-hop to garage and jazz. Ioan Roberts, a co-owner, says the venue, which previously employed about 20 people, has taken advantage of government support schemes wherever it could. But it is still losing money. After hearing that the business will not be able to operate as a nightclub until 21 June at the earliest, Roberts says: “I’m not sure how we are going to get there in one piece. The government will need to urgently improve provision for businesses that are forced to remain closed. We need more or we won’t be around.” The wages of most of the staff are subsidised by the government furlough scheme but the company must still pay 20% or 30% of salaries and will now be forced to ditch about £10,000 of stock. “We are now in a position where we can’t borrow money from a bank because the moment you mention you’re in hospitality they are not interested. By 5 April we could be bust. We could extend that by letting people go but without our key staff we haven’t really got a business.” Sarah Butler The independent retailer SimpleyNatural makes and sells its own soaps, bath salts, shampoos and other bathing products from two shops in Newark and Edwinstowe, Nottinghamshire. Trisha Sutherns, the owner, has shifted to selling online during the high street lockdowns – delivering local orders herself – and has been surprised by the demand. But she says SimpleyNatural cannot survive as an online-only business: “We are not making money. We are keeping going.” Her five workers are on furlough and she isbuilding a social media presence and a new website, but the business will be struggling to survive after Easter, when she will need to begin making repayments on a bounce-back loan taken out last year. On hearing that she will not be able to open until 12 April at the earliest, Sutherns says: “I’m obviously disappointed. That’s past the holiday weekend. Even after 12 April we are going to be really low on trade because people won’t be able to travel and won’t feel confident to be coming to the shop. I’m hoping the councils are ready to back the high street on things like parking and making it feel a safe and friendly environment.” Sarah Butler The holiday cottage manager For Helen Massey, the prospect of a second successive Easter without bookings for her holiday cottages is a blow. Massey, the agent for 16 self-catering properties in the North Yorkshire seaside village of Runswick Bay, will have to wait until at least mid-April before she can take bookings.
Under the government’s roadmap for easing lockdown, self-contained accommodation will be allowed to reopen in the second phase of measures, most likely from 12 April. However, only members of the same household will be allowed to travel domestically and stay overnight until further restrictions are eased, which will not be before mid-May. Massey is concerned this could affect bookings during the spring. “A lot of people are desperate to see family members and gather together,” she says. “It will restrict my income because some people will say we’re just not coming because we can’t come with my mum and dad.” However, Massey is pleased that “joined-up thinking” will allow retail, self-contained accommodation and outdoor hospitality to reopen at the same time in April. “When my guests come on holiday they want to enjoy the things that are on offer nearby.” A path towards full reopening by late June is cause for celebration for Runswick Bay Cottages and other hospitality firms, but comes on the back of a year of disrupted trade. Those businesses are now concentrating on the summer season as a chance to recoup months of lost income. Joanna Partridge"
2021-02-23T03:09:37Z,business,Business,"Hungry Panda was unaware it had to report death of delivery rider, inquiry hears","A manager at food delivery company Hungry Panda has told a parliamentary inquiry she did not know they had a legal obligation to report the death of one of their riders to the New South Wales workplace regulator. Rider Xiaojun Chen, a 43-year-old father of two, was hit and killed by a bus last year while delivering food in Sydney. He was one of five delivery riders, working for gig economy companies like UberEats and Door Dash, who died in the space of two months across Australia. Chen worked for Hungry Panda, which is an international food delivery company, founded in the UK in 2016, that targets the Chinese expatriate market in six countries.
Riders for Hungry Panda are classed as independent contractors, not employees, meaning they are not entitled to award wages, sick leave and other protections. Tina Sun, the company’s Australian HR manager, appeared before a NSW parliamentary inquiry on Tuesday looking into the deaths of delivery drivers. She said she could not remember how many days it took for Hungry Panda to report Chen’s death to SafeWork NSW. Hungry Panda had initially been scheduled to appear before the inquiry in November last year, but the company failed to turn up, with no notice. Their delivery manager, Luna Wei, later apologised, saying that some “riders came to the company without an appointment to discuss some delivery problems”, causing her to miss the inquiry. On Tuesday, Sun said the company found out about Chen’s death “when the accident happened”, but did not report it to SafeWork NSW immediately as required by law. Previously, SafeWork NSW had told the inquiry the Transport Workers Union had been the first organisation to report Chen’s death, after the union found out a week after the collision. “We did report later because when the accident happened, I myself went to the hospital,” Sun said. “I have to say we were not quite familiar with the process. But we did pay very high attention to that accident.” The chair of the committee, Labor MP Daniel Mookhey, asked Sun: “Were you aware you had a legal obligation to report as soon possible?” “No,” Sun said. Mookhey asked Sun whether anyone at Hungry Panda knew their obligations at the time. “We have all the health and safety work notification processes, we were not familiar with that,” Sun said. “But after that, we have worked closely with SafeWork and we have improved the procedure and are quite familiar with this process now.” Sun also disputed whether the union reported the death to SafeWork NSW. “I don’t think the union reported to SafeWork one week after the accident,” she said. The deputy chair, Mark Banasiak said that Hungry Panda had expanded into six different countries, and asked whether the company had failed to “do its due diligence” to learn about the reporting requirements. Chen’s widow, Lihong Wei, had previously told Guardian Australia that Chen’s death would leave her and their two children financially destitute, because they also had to look after both Chen and Wei’s elderly parents, who have acquired disabilities.
On Tuesday, Sun said the company was “still under discussion” whether it would pay any further compensation to Chen’s widow. She said that Wei had received $20,000 from CTP insurance from the bus driver who hit Chen. “We see that as compensation,” she said. She added: “After that accident we have given a lot of support to his family … we helped them apply for the visa and to pay for all the expenses including the return flights and also the funeral costs and also the accommodation.” Sun said the company was still discussing with Wei’s lawyer whether they would pay his family any further compensation. Earlier in the inquiry, two riders testified that Hungry Panda had cut pay rates for its riders – from approximately $7.50 per delivery to $3 per delivery. Sun said that these figures were not accurate, and that pay rates varied and depended on the distance travelled. “The pay change in February was only for the Waterloo and Zetland area,” she said. Sun also told the inquiry that Hungry Panda had “around 100 to 150” workers in Sydney at any one time, and that their business model was “very similar with UberEats or Deliveroo or other delivery companies”. Hungry Panda was established in the UK in 2016, and came to Australia in 2019, Sun said, where it targets “a niche market dedicated to Chinese and Mandarin speakers”."
2021-02-23T00:17:35Z,business,Business,"Time for Jeep to stop using Cherokee as a vehicle name, tribe's chief says","It is time for Jeep to stop using the Cherokee Nation’s name on its Cherokee and Grand Cherokee SUVs, the chief of the Oklahoma-based tribe has said. Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr said in a statement, which was first reported by Car & Driver magazine, that he believes corporations and sports teams should stop using Native American names, images and mascots as nicknames or on their products. “I’m sure this comes from a place that is well-intended, but it does not honor us by having our name plastered on the side of a car,” Hoskin said. The statement marked the first time that the Cherokee Nation had called for the change since Jeep first began using “Cherokee” on its vehicles in the 1970s, according to Car & Driver. Kristin Starnes, a spokesperson for Jeep’s parent company, the Amsterdam-based Stellantis, said in a statement that the vehicle name was carefully selected “and nurtured over the years to honor and celebrate Native American people for their nobility, prowess and pride”.
She did not say whether the company was considering renaming the vehicles and did not immediately reply to an email requesting that information. Hoskin says the best way to honor the Tahlequah, Oklahoma-based tribe is to learn more about its history. “The best way to honor us is to learn about our sovereign government, our role in this country, our history, culture and language and have meaningful dialogue with federally recognized tribes on cultural appropriateness,” Hoskin said. The controversy comes amid a national reckoning over the use of Native American names and images, particularly in sports. After years of resistance and under pressure from corporate sponsors, the NFL’s Washington DC franchise announced last year that it was dropping its “Redskins” nickname and Indian head logo and would go by the name Washington Football Team until a permanent replacement was chosen. Major League Baseball’s Cleveland Indians also announced last year that it would change its name. Hoskin made reference to such changes in his statement to Car & Driver. “I think we’re in a day and age in this country where it’s time for both corporations and team sports to retire the use of Native American names, images and mascots from their products, team jerseys and sports in general,” he said.

2021-02-22T18:59:37Z,business,Business,"All countries must be vaccinated to end pandemic, says World Bank chief","Serious capacity constraints on vaccination programmes pose the biggest threat to the ambitious goal that all 7 billion people across the globe be offered Covid-19 protection within a year, the World Bank’s president has said. In an interview with the Guardian, David Malpass said delivery systems in poor countries and the fact that so many vaccines were going to rich countries were more important factors than money in ensuring success. Malpass said beating the pandemic required all countries to be immunised and that the global community should already be preparing for the next crisis. “One goal the world should have is to prepare for future disasters, other pandemics that will require vaccine systems, and both manufacturing and delivery capacity. I do not expect this to be the only crisis of global proportions. “Let’s look ahead. We both need to resolve this crisis and that takes urgency and capacity, but we also need to make the investments that will pay off over the next decade and the next 50 years.”
Last week the G7 committed an extra $7.5bn to pay for vaccine doses for developing countries. Malpass said the World Bank, which lends to developing nations, would have programmes running in 12 countries by the end of March. “It is not a shortage of money, but supply constraints that are the problem,” Malpass said. “So much capacity is taken up by advanced countries, while poorer countries have made less progress in signing contracts with manufacturers.” An increase in the number of available vaccines would help, Malpass said, but there also needed to be action in poor countries to tackle logistical bottlenecks, to expand healthcare delivery systems, and to develop communication strategies to prepare people for vaccine programmes. “I am hopeful those who want to be vaccinated will have that opportunity over the next year,” the World Bank president said.
Malpass said there was a need to accelerate progress on debt relief so that poor countries had more financial firepower to tackle the pandemic. “We need to broaden the definition of sustainable debt and base it on the ability to provide basic healthcare, education and investments in climate. Resources should be going to things that build for the future. If too big a proportion is going to creditors, that undermines sustainability,” he said, urging public and private creditors to sign up to a global debt relief initiative. Malpass said there was a “disconnect” between what leaders said they wanted and what was achievable in a system that lacked a bankruptcy mechanism for heavily indebted countries and a means for “unsustainable debt to be become sustainable”.
He added: “There should be a process to identify what is sustainable for development. There should be much lower interest rates on the debts.” Interest rates had come down globally, but the “low for long” environment was not reflected in the borrowing costs facing poor countries on their debts, he said. Many debt contracts lacked transparency, he added. “People signing contracts on both sides have somewhat different interests from the people who end up paying for them.”"
2021-02-22T17:50:58Z,business,Business,AllianzGI warns it may vote down big payouts if firms have cut jobs,"Companies that are handing generous pay packages to executives while taking government aid, reducing dividends or cutting jobs during the pandemic could face a shareholder backlash, according to a Germany-based asset manager. Allianz Global Investors (AllianzGI), which manages €582bn (£503bn) worth of assets, said it could use its shareholder powers to vote against pay awards during the upcoming annual shareholder meeting season. It said it would scrutinise “generous pay proposals on a case-by case-basis whenever companies received substantial direct state aid, substantial layoffs were recorded or dividend cuts happened … as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.” The policy echoes warnings by the Investment Association, an industry body that said last April that companies that received government Covid support should cut executive pay and consider clawing back bonuses from bosses. Many of the UK’s largest companies have tapped emergency support schemes including business rates relief and government-backed Covid loans during the pandemic. AllianzGI said it would not penalise companies for using government furlough schemes, which have helped cover employee wages during the crisis. It will also give companies a pass if they were forced to cut or cancel dividends by regulators, saving the UK’s largest banks from a potential backlash. AllianzGI’s global head of sustainable and impact investing, Matt Christensen, said: “The Covid crisis marked a turning point for society and businesses alike; however, companies are affected in different ways. Some received state aid and their business will continue to be affected negatively over the longer term. In these cases AllianzGI expects boards to deal responsibly with taxpayers’ money and we do not see scope for substantial payout to management, if any. “Other companies decided to forego dividends to save capital. Again, Allianz Global Investors expects boards to act responsibly and align shareholder experience with that of management.’”
AllianzGI revealed on Monday that it rejected 49% of pay votes put forward for shareholder approval last year, even before its new policy was introduced. The main reason for voting against remuneration plans was that corporate payouts were not tied to “robust and challenging” targets, and that companies were not transparent enough about the criteria. In the UK, AllianzGI voted against 12% of pay proposals last year, down from 20% in 2019. It was among the 30% of shareholders who voted against Ocado’s pay report last May, over a pay rise and £88m bonus for the online grocer’s directors. The asset manager was also among the shareholders representing just over 67% of the stock at the retailer’s annual meeting who failed to back the remuneration report in June, when the company made a late change to its pay plan and handed an additional £1.6m to its outgoing chief executive, Dave Lewis, and £900,000 to its finance director, Alan Stewart."
2021-02-22T17:39:16Z,business,Business,G4S set for takeover by Allied Universal Security Services,"Security outsourcing firm G4S looks set to be taken over by Allied Universal Security Services, after rival Canadian suitor GardaWorld said it would not be increasing its existing bid to trump the US firm’s £3.8bn offer. G4S, which operates services including running four British prisons and managing 21 UK Covid-19 test centres, saw its stock jump as the long-running bidding war between GardaWorld and Allied Universal intensified. However, on Monday GardaWorld said that it would not be increasing its 235p-a-share offer, which valued G4S at £3.68bn (£2.61bn), bringing to an end the auction process called by the UK Takeover Panel. The company said that while it believes there is “no better” owner for G4S, it would not overpay for a company facing environmental, social and governance scandals. “We are disciplined buyers and we will not overpay for a company with systemic [environmental, social and governance] issues that continue to come to light,” said Stéphan Crétier, founder and chairman of GardaWorld. “There are better and less risky opportunities available to GardaWorld.” G4S has faced heavy criticism after being stripped of several government contracts, including running HMP Birmingham, but most of its work is in the corporate sector. G4S runs cash-handling services and provides security operations for clients including the new Hinckley Point C nuclear power station. GardaWorld’s final offer falls short of American rival Allied Universal’s 245p-a-share bid lodged in December, which the board of G4S recommended shareholders vote to accept. G4S employs 533,000 staff across 85 countries, with its biggest business in North America. The directors of Allied Universal and G4S said the combined company would create a “world-leading integrated security business with revenues of approximately $18bn [£12.8bn at today’s conversion rate]”. The company’s share price closed down nearly 10% at 243p, just below the level of Allied Universal’s offer per share."
2021-02-22T16:30:06Z,business,Business,Women continue to carry the load when it comes to unpaid work | Greg Jericho,"In news that will shock no women around the nation, the latest survey shows women do much more unpaid work than men. At least the survey shows that in the past year more men doing more unpaid work than they were last year. The problem is so too are women. The past year saw many of us in our homes a lot more than normal. And while that has involved many of working from home, it has also involved more unpaid work at home. When for example young children are at home rather than at school, someone needs to be there supervising them. The latest survey by the Bureau of Statistics on the household impacts of Covid-19 sought to discover who was doing most of this unpaid work. It is of course, women:
Graph not displaying? Click here Nearly 45% of all women with children spend more than five hours each week supervising or caring for them – more than a third spend over 20 hours. By contrast just 32% of men spend more than five hours a week and a mere 17% do more than 20 hours watching over or caring for their children. This is, of course, no shock. It confirms all household surveys done over the years, but it is worth highlighting because while it might be unsurprising it doesn’t mean it should be a given. And the reality is that even when we exclude childcare and focus on other unpaid work around the house, women are the ones carrying the bulk of the load:
Graph not displaying? Click here Over a quarter of women spend more than 10 hours a week doing unpaid indoor housework compared to just 8% of men. When we shift outdoors, 7% of men spend more than 10 hours a week on outdoor housework and repairs, barely above the 6% of women who spend that amount of time doing the same unpaid work. When we break down who spends more than five hours a week doing various tasks, once again women are the heavy lifters, and men are the leaners. Over half of women spend more than five hours a week doing indoor housework, compared to just 28% of men, and women continue to be the ones who will most likely be cooking dinners – 54% of women spend more than five hours a week doing so, compared to 30% of men:
Graph not displaying? Click here A quarter of men spend more than five hours a week caring or supervising children – roughly the same level who spend such time on outdoor housework and repairs. But the reality is the level of work done by men outdoors does not balance the work done by women indoors. At this point the common response by those who get irked by such facts is that men do more paid employment so it all evens out. Unfortunately that argument does not stack up. In 2019 the Melbourne Institute’s Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey found that even when taking into account the amount of paid employment, women did more work. When men were the main breadwinner of a household the amount of work both paid and unpaid was roughly the same by both the men and women, but in all other cases – even when women were the main breadwinner – women did more overall work:
Graph not displaying? Click here But clearly the Covid-19 pandemic has seen an increase in the amount of work being done, and men have definitely lifted their unpaid workload. Across all activities more men say they are doing more work now than are year ago compared to the amount of men who say they are doing less:
Graph not displaying? Click here Ten percent of men say they are doing more indoor housework than last year compared to 5% who say they are doing less. And yet women are also doing more work than last year. Nearly 20% of women say they now do more indoor housework compared to last year, while 6% say they do less:

Click here Somewhat oddly given the astonishing increase in grocery shopping done in the past year, the only category that more women say they are doing less work is on such shopping. And while it is good that men have increased their workload, the reality remains that women have increased theirs by more. In all categories except grocery shopping more women have increased their level of work compared to men:
Graph not displaying? Click here Before the pandemic women did more unpaid work than men and during the pandemic men increased the amount of unpaid work they did. But so too did women, and so we see women continue to be the ones carrying the load when it comes to work that doesn’t get paid."
2021-02-22T16:30:04Z,business,Business,Jobseeker to be raised by $50 a fortnight when coronavirus supplement scrapped,"Government ministers have agreed to permanently lift the base rate of the jobseeker payment by $50 a fortnight when the coronavirus supplement ends next month. It’s expected the government will outline the future of the unemployment benefit as soon as Tuesday but Guardian Australia has been told ministers on Friday agreed to a permanent boost to the base rate of jobseeker. While other potential reforms to welfare payments are still being considered, it’s understood the expenditure review committee has agreed to the $50 a fortnight base rate increase, equivalent to about $3.50-a-day. That means those receiving the benefit will get $615.70 a fortnight, which is still a drop from the current rate of $715 a fortnight, when the $150 coronavirus supplement expires at the end of March.
Welfare groups reacted angrily to the planned increase, after it was revealed by Guardian Australia on Tuesday. The Australian Council of Social Service said any reduction in payments after March would lack “human decency”, while the Australian Unemployed Workers Union described the $50-a-fortnight increase as a “cruel joke”. The permanent $50 increase will begin on 1 April and will be applied to jobseeker, youth allowance, Austudy, Abstudy and parenting payments. It is expected to cost about $9bn over four years. Before the pandemic, the base rate of jobseeker for a single person was $565 a fortnight, or about $40 a day. It’s understood other possible changes – including potentially winding back more generous pandemic-era means testing and income thresholds – that could accompany the increase to benefits have not yet been finalised. Such changes could ultimately alter the net dollar benefit to recipients. The office of the social services minister, Anne Ruston, would not comment. Cabinet met on Monday night before the increase is expected to be put to the Coalition party room meeting on Tuesday. Government ministers were tightlipped about the future of the jobseeker payment on Monday. The finance minister, Simon Birmingham, told ABC Radio the government was “still finalising all of our decisions in these areas”. “We’ll make any announcements about that, as we’ve indicated, well and truly clear by the end of March,” he said. Expectations have grown in recent weeks that the government would permanently increase the payment, with welfare groups, Labor, the Greens and even the Reserve Bank of Australia urging the Coalition not to allow the payment to fall back to the pre-pandemic rate. But the planned increase to the dole – the first in real terms since the mid-1990s – is likely to anger welfare groups who had hoped the doubling of jobseeker payments 12 months ago would not be wound back so easily. ACOSS had called for a permanent increase to jobseeker of at least $25 per day – or $350 a fortnight – while the Australian Unemployed Workers Union, backed by the Greens, wanted it raised to $80 a day, which is closer to the rate paid at the height of the pandemic. The relative poverty line for a single person – set at 50% of median income – is $914 a fortnight, while another measure, the Henderson poverty line, puts it at about $1,100 a fortnight. The jobseeker payment was initially doubled with a $550 coronavirus supplement before the top-up payment was reduced in September and January. Labor has declined to name a preferred figure but had called on the government to announce a permanent increase. A new report from Anglicare Victoria shows the success of the coronavirus supplement in alleviating financial stress during the pandemic. The report, released on Tuesday, found the agency’s financial counselling service saw a reduction in client numbers during the pandemic, which was attributed to the massive boost to welfare payments and the jobkeeper scheme. A review of the service data of nearly 9,500 Victorian clients found more than a third had listed utilities such as electricity and water as a leading source of financial difficulty during the July-September quarter of 2020. That was followed by credit card and household debt (28%). Although boosted welfare benefits were said to reduce demand for financial counselling, those who did need help were more likely to report “multiple vulnerabilities during lockdown”. Nearly half said they were also facing family violence, mental illness or substance abuse as well as financial difficulties during the July-September quarter. In metropolitan Melbourne, 50.9% reported multiple vulnerabilities, up from 30.8% before the pandemic. Clients were also more likely to report life events – such as job loss, health issues or a relationship breakdown – as a factor contributing to financial distress. The Anglicare Victoria chief executive, Paul McDonald, said that overall the jobseeker and jobkeeper programs had “worked for those affected by Covid-19”.
“They gave people without work a better quality of life, helping them meet their debts and restore their dignity,” he said. “They gave people more ability to pay off outstanding debt and the research recommends that they should be permanent.” About 1.3 million people are currently receiving unemployment benefits, up from about 700,000 before the pandemic, but a reduction from a peak of 1.6 million last year. The jobkeeper wage subsidy is also due to expire at the end of March – a move which is expected to see some people lose their jobs and move onto jobseeker payment. Analysis by Guardian Australia has found some of Australia’s poorest electorate will lose millions of dollars a fortnight when the coronavirus supplement ends at the end of March."

Some people might argue that a burst of inflation might be welcome - at least temporarily - in some economies that have struggled for more than a decade to accelerate. However, if pressures do build too much central banks could be tempted to remove some stimulus. That concern has held back stocks across the world. The FTSE 100 lost 0.5% on Monday, dropping to 6,589 points. The mid-cap FTSE 250 lost 0.8%. In the US the tech-focused Nasdaq composite lost 1.2% in early trading, while the S&P 500 was down by 0.6%. Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG, an investing platform, said: Markets are kicking off on a hesitant tone despite hopes for a positive reopening roadmap from Boris Johnson today. Rising inflation and Treasury yields are once again providing a cause for concern despite vaccination-led hopes of an economic resurgence. European markets have kicked off the week on a somewhat unstable footing, with the fears over rising inflation and Treasury yields once again dampening sentiment on a day that had promised to be dominated by reopening hopes.

2021-02-22T14:42:59Z,business,Business,"Boris Johnson's lockdown exit plan is slower, but not pain-free","No big bang reopening. No promises that might be broken. No immediate prospect of life returning to normal for those businesses most severely affected by the restrictions deemed necessary to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. That, put simply, is what the government’s roadmap for leaving lockdown in England means for the economy. Having been burned badly last year, Boris Johnson has decided to take things much more slowly this time. Not only that, in the early stages of the plan, the need to get children back into school and to allow families a limited amount of freedom to socialise have taken precedence. Non-essential retail stores and hairdressers will have been closed for at least three months before they are allowed to reopen. It will be mid-May at the earliest before it will be possible to get a drink indoors in a pub. The government’s thinking is obvious: better to take it slow and steady rather than risk the economic and political catastrophe of a fourth lockdown. The number of new reported cases of Covid-19 is falling, but Johnson has learned the hard way the moral of the story of the tortoise and the hare. That said, the government’s approach is by no means risk-free. For a start, it means the Treasury is going to have to continue writing big cheques to support furloughed workers and shuttered businesses for a lot longer than Rishi Sunak had planned for at the back end of last year. The roadmap will have a direct impact on next week’s budget, the latest in a series of expensive short-term fixes for the economy. The chancellor never passes up an opportunity to tell voters that the government has so far spent £280bn on pandemic economic support, but many small businesses still feel neglected, even abandoned. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that a third of firms have cash reserves of three months or less. A slower pace of reopening means more of these businesses will go to the wall. Inevitably, more jobs will be lost. CMA’s big tech investigations are welcome There are plenty of reasons for the UK to avoid a fight with big US tech companies. Downing Street is keen to foster good relations with Joe Biden and eager to attract the likes of Google, Facebook and Apple to boost investment post-Brexit; there is scant evidence that digital retailers such as Amazon are using their market power to rip off consumers. So, it is all the more interesting that the chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority, Andrea Coscelli, has used an interview with the Financial Times to announce that the watchdog is to conduct a series of anti-trust investigations into big tech over the coming year. That news is to be welcomed, because the reasons for investigating the activities of big tech outweigh the reasons for not doing so. One is that consumers are not really getting Google and Facebook for free: they are paying with their personal data. There are privacy issues here. Coscelli is also concerned that the tech companies are using their financial power to gobble up smaller rivals that they feel pose a threat. Adam Smith, who had strong views about the threat posed by monopolists, would no doubt approve. But investigations don’t necessarily mean action will be taken. The CMA should expect plenty of pushback. John Lewis must adapt, or face more closures John Lewis has always prided itself on having loyal customers who were prepared to pay a little more for quality products and one-on-one service from assistants who knew their stuff. That business model has run smack up against a world in which consumers buy more things online and adapting it is not going to be easy, especially at pace. If the reports are true, eight more stores are to close. The prospects for the 34 that would remain would not be rosy."
2021-02-22T13:12:25Z,business,Business,Former Rio Tinto CEO handed 20% pay rise despite caves scandal,"The disgraced former chief executive of Rio Tinto was handed £7.2m for last year, a pay rise of 20%, despite overseeing the destruction of the sacred 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia. Jean-Sébastien Jacques agreed to step down from the mining company “by mutual agreement” with Rio Tinto’s board after the Juukan Gorge scandal last year, but the ousted mining boss will still take home his biggest ever pay packet for his time as chief executive. On top of the £7.2m pay for last year, Jacques, who stepped down on 1 January, will take home £519,000 for his remaining five months of unworked notice period this year, and £215,000 for his unused leave. Other senior executives who stepped down in the wake of the Juukan scandal have also received financial benefits. Simone Niven, the head of corporate relations, and Chris Salisbury, the head of iron ore, were given “termination benefits” worth $1m and $1.3m respectively.
The decision to blow up the rock shelters in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, which were highly significant to the area’s Aboriginal traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people, was taken to help the Anglo-Australian miner access better-quality iron ore deposits. It led to an outcry from Indigenous Australian groups and investors, who denounced the board’s decision to dock Jacques’ pay by £1m as inadequate, and to calls for Jacques to be removed as chief executive.
Jacques was replaced at the start of the year by Rio Tinto’s former chief financial officer, Jakob Stausholm. Stausholm said the company has been “working to restore trust with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people”. “We are also developing additional measures to strengthen our partnerships with traditional owners in Australia, including a commitment to modernise and improve agreements in the Pilbara, home to our iron ore business,” he said.
In Rio Tinto’s annual report, the board said Jacques’ windfall was in large part due to the significant increase in the company’s share price after he became chief executive of the miner in 2016. The company’s market value has more than tripled in the last five years, to more than £78.4bn, and for 2020 it handed shareholders a record payout of £9bn, the highest in the company’s 148-year history. The company’s fortunes have improved in line with the rising price of iron ore, which is used to make steel, and copper for use in electricity infrastructure. The strong global demand for the metals has driven copper and iron ore prices to nine-year highs in recent weeks. Rio Tinto’s chairman, Simon Thompson, said that allowing the destruction of the Juukan Gorge was “a breach of both our values and the trust placed in us” by the “traditional owners of the land on which we operate”.
“In the months and years to come, we are determined to learn the lessons from Juukan Gorge, to rebuild the trust that has been lost, and to re-establish our leadership in environmental and social performance,” he said. “Today, shareholders are increasingly focused not only on the financial return that they can earn on their investment, but also on how that return is made. In order to build and maintain trust in Rio Tinto, we must seek to achieve environmental and social goals alongside generating profit for our shareholders.” The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) said Rio Tinto’s handling of the disaster raises more questions about the fitness of its current board. The group has called on investors to “hold Thompson and other board members accountable” and insist on “necessary, constructive change to the company’s board composition so that the task of rebuilding community trustcan begin in earnest”."
2021-02-22T11:30:38Z,business,Business,UK competition watchdog warns big tech firms of investigations,"The UK’s competition watchdog plans to launch a series of antitrust investigations into big tech companies including Google and Amazon this year, in the latest sign of increased scrutiny of the practices of the Silicon Valley companies. The Competition and Markets Authority will later this year become home to a new digital markets unit (DMU), which will police the internet companies and have powers to impose fines of billions of pounds. “Until we have these new legal powers, if we want to achieve impact for consumers in the UK, we need to use our current [tools],” said Andrea Coscelli, the CMA chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times. “There are quite a few cases against the digital platforms in Brussels today, and a number of these include the UK market.” After Brexit, the CMA’s investigations will be independent, but Coscelli said the UK will continue to work alongside Brussels on some joint antitrust investigations at least until next year. The DMU will enforce a code based on “fair trading, trust and transparency” that will apply to companies deemed to have strategic market status (SMS). This could include, for example, assessing whether the way the tech giants trade with publishers is on terms fair enough to prevent them “from taking advantage of power and position”. Platforms such as Google and Facebook have commercial deals in place to republish content such as excerpts, headlines or preview images. Facebook moved to ban the sharing and publishing of news content in Australia earlier this month in response to a proposed new law that would force it and Google to negotiate with news companies over payment for content. Google has responded by striking deals with more than 50 publishers in Australia, including the Guardian, to feature content in its News Showcase product. On Monday the UK government said it was concerned about the situation in Australia and confirmed that the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, would meet Facebook bosses this week. “We are obviously concerned about access to news being restricted in Australia,” said a spokesperson for Boris Johnson. “As we always have done, we will be robust in defending free speech and journalism.” Although no tech firms have been officially awarded SMS status yet, the criteria will include companies that earn more than £1bn in UK revenues, or £25bn globally. Google makes more than $160bn (£120bn) in worldwide revenues annually, while Facebook makes more than $70bn. “We are actively scanning the players, the complaints we have received, the cases that others are doing, what could be done in parallel with others, where are the gaps in the work the European commission is doing,” Coscelli said. “We certainly expect to open more cases during the course of this year.” There is an expectation that acquisitions made by big tech companies will come in for more scrutiny. In December, the recommendations on the scope of the new DMU’s powers pointed out that between 2008 and 2018 Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple made 400 acquisitions, but only a “handful” were reviewed by competition regulators and none were blocked. For example, Coscelli questioned the EU’s recent clearing of Google’s takeover of Fitbit, saying he was “sceptical” of the solutions offered by the two companies which Brussels had deemed acceptable. “Long-term behaviour remedies were ultimately accepted by the European commission in this particular case,” he said. “Our concern is that it’s very difficult to monitor sufficiently and enforce this type of remedy.” The new rules will not allow the DMU to “implement full ownership separation” by breaking up a tech company – such a move would be for the CMA, if it was deemed necessary. The government gave the green light for the DMU to be set up after the CMA’s study into the UK’s £13bn digital advertising market, which is dominated by Google and Facebook. The study found that Google controls 90% of UK search revenues and Facebook accounts for more than half of the British digital display ad market.
The CMA’s review indicates that the duopoly’s dominance in this area is also likely to be a focus. Issues highlighted include a “lack of consumer control” over data use, the targeting of personalised advertising, and market power reducing innovation. Silicon Valley companies face increasing scrutiny from regulatory bodies around the world. The EU is investigating the practices of companies including Apple and Amazon. The US justice department was joined by 11 states in October to sue Google, accusing it of acting unlawfully to maintain its dominant position in search and advertising. It also emerged in December that Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, threatened to pull investment from the UK if the government did not soften its stance on the regulation of Silicon Valley companies. Matt Hancock, who held a meeting with Zuckerberg in 2018 when he was culture secretary, said in response that the UK could “shift from threatening regulation to encouraging collaborative working to ensure legislation is proportionate and innovation-friendly”."
2021-02-22T09:44:48Z,business,Business,British Airways defers £450m of pension payments as Covid cuts flights,"British Airways has struck a deal to delay £450m of pension deficit contributions as the company struggles through Covid travel restrictions that have left most of its planes grounded during the pandemic. The carrier’s owner, International Airlines Group (IAG), has also reached a final agreement over a £2bn loan that will give the company a larger financial cushion until Covid restrictions are eased. BA, which usually pays £37.5m a month into the New Airways Pension Scheme (NAPS), has struck a deal with trustees that will allow it to delay its contributions until September 2021. The airline was allowed to temporarily suspend its payments throughout negotiations, meaning it has not been contributing to the scheme since September last year. The formal extension means it will have deferred payments for 12 months in total, helping preserve £450m in cash. “In addition to these arrangements, IAG continues to explore other debt initiatives to improve further its liquidity,” the company said in a statement. IAG’s shares closed up more than 7% at 178p.
The travel and hospitality sectors have been hit hard by the Covid crisis, forcing firms to cut jobs, sell off assets and put staff on furlough. On Monday, the pubs group Mitchells & Butlers said it was also delaying £12.6m of payments to its staff pension fund to help preserve cash. BA plans to repay its pension contributions, with interest, and has put forward some of its properties as security until the debt has been paid off in full. As part of the deal, BA has also agreed not to pay any dividends to its parent company IAG before the end of 2023. After that, it has committed to match dividend payments with a pension contribution worth at least half of what it will pay IAG. The airline is trying to plug a £2.4bn hole in the New Airways Pension Scheme, which closed to new staff in 2003. The deficit was discovered during a valuation in 2018. BA has paid £1.3bn of that total, including £263m in 2020. BA has also finalised the terms of a £2bn five-year loan agreed on 31 December, underwritten by a syndicate of banks and partially guaranteed by UK Export Finance, which it expects to receive within a week. The money will further improve the airline’s parlous financial position as it continues to burn through cash while awaiting the restart of mass international travel. BA’s owner, IAG, tapped shareholders for €2.75bn (£2.37bn) in a rights issue last September, and BA has also obtained £300m from the Bank of England’s Covid financing facility. BA, normally the main source of profit for IAG, saw its revenues fall by 90% during last year’s peak summer season, having lost 98% of its passengers during the UK’s first lockdown. IAG had reported a €6bn loss by the third quarter of last year and renewed travel restrictions will have affected it further in the final quarter of 2020. The group is expected to announce full results for 2020 on Friday. Even more stringent curbs on international travel have been in place in 2021, with the government’s new roadmap out of lockdown permitting no leisure trips before 17 May at the earliest. BA laid off more than 10,000 staff last year and placed many of its remaining employees on less generous contracts as it retrenched for what managers insisted was a fight for survival."

The All Bar One owner, which also runs pub chains including O’Neill’s and restaurant brands such as Harvester, usually pays £4.2m a month into its pension fund. It has agreed to delay payments for at least three months, with plans to restart contributions in April. The suspension is intended to improve its store of cash as the group revealed it only had £113m left. M&B said it had been burning through £30m-£35m every four weeks since the start of the year and had already drawn on all its lending facilities.
All of the group’s 1,600 pubs and restaurants have been closed since 30 December because of the Covid lockdown. Sales were down 70% between September and January, a period in which Covid rules were tightened after a brief respite over the summer. M&B, which also runs Toby Carvery and Miller & Carter, confirmed plans to tap investors for up to £350m by issuing new shares. The group said its cash positions had “deteriorated significantly” during the pandemic and the fundraising was “critical for the continued operation of the group and its immediate financial stability”. The extra cash will be used to pay off some of its debt and invest in its pubs and restaurants to help it stay competitive as Covid restrictions are eased.
Pubs and restaurants could start serving customers outdoors by late April, as part of lockdown easing measures that will be outlined by Boris Johnson on Monday afternoon. Phil Urban, the chief executive of Mitchells & Butlers, said: “M&B was a high performing business coming into the pandemic and with the support of our main stakeholders, including the equity injection from this open offer, we have every confidence that we can emerge in a strong competitive position once current restrictions are lifted.” Shares were down more than 1% on Monday morning at 319p."
2021-02-22T06:00:21Z,business,Business,Aircraft orders dry up as industry records worst ever January,"Orders for new aircraft all but dried up in January as the airline industry continued to be buffeted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Just four commercial aircraft orders were placed last month, according to ADS, the UK trade organisation. That’s the worst January on record for orders, down from 296 in January 2020. These orders were all for widebody aircraft – four 747-8 freighters produced by Boeing, with no new orders of passenger aircraft. No orders for single-aisle aircraft were placed, for the first January on record, with the global pandemic and international travel restrictions continuing to suppress demand. ADS said the figures provided a “stark comparison” with January 2020, when orders of single-aisle planes hit a record high of 285, before the Covid-19 crisis struck. ADS’s chief executive, Paul Everitt, said the UK government should ensure financial support reaches airlines, airports and aerospace companies to help them survive the crisis. “We are almost a year into the global pandemic and the UK’s aerospace sector continues to struggle with draconian travel restrictions,” said Everitt. “Whilst I am confident travel demand will return, the timing of the recovery is now more difficult to predict. Co-ordinated international action is necessary to reopen borders and allow consumers to travel with confidence.”
Aircraft deliveries in January 2021 rose by 7% year on year, with 47 deliveries made – 26 by US manufacturer Boeing and 21 by Europe’s Airbus. Boeing’s delivery total included 21 737 Max jets, which were recently given approval to fly again after a 20-month ban. But the backlog of aircraft orders fell last month to 12,989, 8% lower than a year ago, and the first time since July 2015 that manufacturers have had fewer than 13,000 orders on their books. ADS blamed the decline on a combination of too few new orders coming in, and a rise in cancellations in recent months as airlines cut back due to weak demand. Six plane orders, all at Boeing, were cancelled last January. During 2020 as a whole, aircraft orders tumbled by 59%, with no new planes ordered in September.
Last week Airbus reported a loss of more than €1bn (£860m) for last year, after deliveries of commercial aircraft fell by a third to 566, down sharply from 863 in 2019, amid a flurry of cancelled orders. The group, which operates factories in Filton, near Bristol, and Broughton, north Wales, also warned that deliveries are unlikely to improve this year. ADS also reported that orders for new jet engines fell 97% in January. Just 16 were ordered – all for widebody planes – down from a total of 552 in January 2020."
2021-02-21T17:27:33Z,business,Business,John Lewis considering fresh store closures in response to Covid,"John Lewis is understood to be considering a fresh round of store closures, underscoring the toll that the pandemic is taking on Britain’s deserted high streets. The 156-year-old retailer is understood to be reconsidering the scale of its national network of branches, less than eight months after it announced the closure of eight stores to cope with the impact of coronavirus. Up to eight more of its 42 remaining outlets could now be closed down, the Sunday Times reported, as the John Lewis Partnership, which also owns Waitrose, considers cutting space and costs by moving into smaller sites. John Lewis declined to comment, but any closures would be a new blow to Britain’s beleaguered high streets, after the recent demise of Debenhams and Philip Green’s Arcadia chain, which have been bought by online specialists Boohoo and Asos and will disappear from shopping streets. The consent of the company’s landlords will be key in any plan by John Lewis to shut shops. But the downsizing plans could be revealed alongside the company’s annual results, due on 11 March, when the extent of the damage wreaked by the pandemic will become clearer. While online retailers such as Amazon and Ocado have thrived amid successive lockdowns, owning a national network of branches has hit retailers like John Lewis hard. The impact of Covid-19 came at the worst possible time for the company, which was already facing mounting problems from online rivals. It had reported its first ever half-year loss in September 2019. In September last year, after the first lockdown, the company said sales were holding up well, as online sales had surged. But the impact of that success has hit the stores hard. Before the pandemic the store group calculated that £6 out of every £10 in sales was linked to browsing in stores. But last autumn the group said that Covid had cut the sales linked to stores to just £3 out of £10. As a result the group slashed the notional value of its bricks-and-mortar shops by £470m – which pushed the company to a huge £635m half-year loss. The slump into the red meant that John Lewis said it would cancel the annual bonus it awards to staff this year for the first time since 1953. With the company at a crossroads, Dame Sharon White, the chairman, wielded the axe over eight stores. The shop closures came at a cost of 1,300 jobs, with shops in Croydon, Watford, Newbury, Swindon and Tamworth shutting their doors, as well as small hubs at Heathrow airport and London St Pancras station. A new store in Birmingham, where the department store’s former managing director Andy Street is mayor of the West Midlands, was also shut down. White is hoping to revive the group’s fortunes with a move into property, converting nearly half of the company’s flagship department store on London’s Oxford Street into office space. There are also plans to build homes for rent alongside some of its supermarkets. According to a report released last month, England’s high streets could lose up to 400,000 retail jobs as a result of more people working from home and shopping online after the coronavirus pandemic, with affluent towns in the south among the most vulnerable. The UK Treasury is exploring options for an online sales tax in response to an explosion in internet shopping, as Covid-19 accelerates the closure of high street shops across the country."
2021-02-21T17:26:30Z,business,Business,City watchdog halts new business at Buy2LetCars,"The City regulator has halted new business at a company that promises bumper returns from a car hire scheme aimed at people with poor credit ratings, prompting a backlash from the firm at the “bizarre” decision. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it was concerned about the “viability” of Buy2LetCars, after raising regulatory concerns with directors.
Buy2LetCars is now barred from arranging any new leases on behalf of its investors, although it can continue collecting payments from people who have hired cars via sister brand Wheels4Sure. “We are surprised at the FCA’s interpretation of accepted accounting standards and principles,” said the directors of Raedex Consortium, which owns the business. “Although our company is well financed with a strong cashflow and bank balance, the FCA is putting 24 jobs at risk with this bizarre decision. “We would like to reassure our customers that we fully intend to challenge this and will be in touch with them directly this week.” Buy2LetCars promises its investors annual returns of up to 11%, if they lend the company a minimum of £7,000 over three years. It uses the money to buy new cars, which it then leases to people with a poor credit history via Wheels4Sure. Investors receive monthly payments over the term of the loan, with interest paid at the end of the term. This form of investment is not regulated, so investors do not have recourse to the Financial Ombudsman. But the FCA can prevent the company from arranging new leases and has now wielded its power to do so. The FCA said it had had concerns about the company for some time. “We have engaged with the firm on a number of occasions with regard to regulatory issues, including the structure of its business and its financial viability. This has culminated in the action we took on Friday 19 February 2021. “Our interventions, following detailed analysis, were imminent and we took steps on Friday to best protect the interests of investors.
“As always our objective is that any issues that may affect a firm’s viability are handled in an orderly way. Making sure that the assets of the firm are secured provides the best outcome for investors.” The Sunday Times, which first reported the story, said concerns about the company were passed to the FCA’s former chief executive Andrew Bailey by a campaigner in 2019. Bailey has since become governor of the Bank of England. Raedex is owned by Reginald Larry-Cole, who also owns PayGo Cars, Triple R Lifestyles and Regnata Dreams.
He has previously tweeted about the virtues of a business model that he said offers consistent returns while helping frontline workers."
2021-02-21T15:07:28Z,business,Business,Electric busmaker Arrival schedules first UK road trial,"Electric buses built by Arrival, the UK-based manufacturer, will be tested on British roads for the first time later this year in a trial with the transport company First Group. The tests will begin in the autumn of this year, starting with four of the first production vehicles produced at Arrival’s research and development facility in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Discussions are under way about further trials with other companies. The trials are the latest step in the rapid expansion of Arrival, which has attracted investment worth hundreds of millions of pounds to build battery-powered vans and buses with zero exhaust emissions. The company, still yet to start full production, hopes that by 2024 it will make revenues of about $3.1bn (£2.2bn) from bus sales, along with about $10.9bn from vans. Arrival is also looking at an undisclosed number of new sites for factories within the UK, a signal of its intent to ramp up output as it prepares a reverse listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange in New York at a valuation of $5.4bn (£3.9bn). The company’s main operations will remain in the UK. Bus companies are hurrying to cut carbon emissions to meet clean air regulations in cities. First Group will not buy diesel buses after 2022, and it plans to eliminate exhaust emissions by 2035. First Group is also running separate trials of electric buses made by the rival manufacturers BYD ADL, Optare and Yutong, as well as a trial of hydrogen fuel cell buses in Aberdeen, its home city.
Arrival hopes to roll out bus production quickly to target big cities around the world. It aims to produce 1,000 buses in 2022 and 11,000 in 2024. As well as a facility at Bicester, also in Oxfordshire, Arrival has started work on a factory in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Arrival, which now employs more than 1,400 people, was founded in secret in 2014 by Denis Sverdlov, a Russian telecoms entrepreneur. The company is using “microfactory” facilities that break with the traditional logic of making cars on big production lines, instead using robots to assemble vehicles in “cells”. Arrival’s first publicly announced product, an electric van for “last-mile” delivery in cities, will begin trials with United Parcel Service, a US courier, at the end of February. UPS last year ordered 10,000 vans in a deal worth €400m (£350m). Avinash Rugoobur, Arrival’s president, said built-in tracking, information screens and internet connections could allow the buses to connect better with other modes of transport and provide better user experiences. The flat floor also makes accessibility easier. “We’re really at the start of what’s possible just within the bus platform,” Rugoobur said. Buses in use today “definitely do the job, but similar to the van market we’re talking about technology that hasn’t moved to where the world is today.”
The electric buses will be priced much like diesel buses, although Arrival estimates that the total cost of ownership will be significantly less because of lower fuel and maintenance costs. It has not disclosed the buses’ range, but Rugoobur said they should be able to handle most urban routes. Arrival buys its batteries from Korea’s LG Chem, but Rugoobur said the company would be glad to source batteries in the future from a UK-based factory, if one could be successfully launched. The company is also working on driverless operations for controlled situations such as within company depots, although Rugoobur cautioned that driverless buses on roads were some way off. “For driverless buses to be a reality you need true, fault-tolerant road-going autonomy,” he said. We’re not there.”"
2021-02-21T14:39:44Z,business,Business,New breed of local food halls in UK towns offer grub and a hub,"Food halls were springing up in town and city centres before the pandemic but now smaller community versions, with an extra dimension such as a cinema screen or co-working space, could be arriving on a high street near you. There is potential for up to 120 of these community food halls across the UK, a new report has found, as big shifts in consumer spending and attitudes caused by the coronavirus pandemic – including a newfound appreciation of local community – prompt investors to consider piling in. “These community hubs will give people pride in their town centres again,” said Thomas Rose, a co-founder of the real estate consultancy P-Three, of a new generation of food halls. “This move towards being a loyal supporter of your high street is not going to go away. “We have spoken to a handful of private equity groups who are looking to invest in this type of concept because they see the consumer wants this,” Rose said. “Local authorities love the concept too.” There are around 40 food halls in the UK, from flagship venues such as Seven Dials Market in central London to smaller ones in market towns.
While P-Three’s analysis also sees scope for a further 50 flagships to open in cities such as Glasgow, Birmingham and Bristol once the pandemic is over, the community model offers something for smaller catchments, hard hit by retail closures but where more money is now being spent. A former Poundland store in Lewisham, south London, is now Catford Mews, where locals can eat or watch a film or comedy gig. Another example is Cutlery Works in Sheffield where a food hall now fills a former cutlery factory. When Catford Mews opened in 2019, Preston Benson, the managing director of Really Local Group which is behind the venue, said locals’ jaws were “hitting the floor”. “They were saying: ‘Oh my God I can’t believe there’s something like this where I live,’” said Benson. “Everyone deserves to have nice, convenient things where they live.”
Really Local Group’s other projects include turning the site of a former Blockbuster shop on Sidcup high street in south-east London into Storyhouse, a complex with a cafe, cinema and library. “This is gonna be an all-singing, all-dancing community hub,” said Benson. Urban regeneration has historically been retail-led, but with high streets battered by a crisis that has led to household names such as Topshop and Debenhams collapsing and online sales rocketing, no one thinks more shopping is the answer any more. “The danger in real estate is that people are too often just trying to fill space,” said Rose, who says community food halls could provide alternative anchors. “We advise people to put the right tenants in the right buildings, to make sure it is sustainable. “There will definitely be some stores which can be converted [into food halls] but a 1970s department store isn’t always the best building.” In Darlington, County Durham, which lost two landmark stores from its main shopping thoroughfare when Marks & Spencer and House of Fraser closed, the historic indoor market is being overhauled to create a food hall, bar, events stage and temperate garden. Despite the shadow of Covid-19, Dan Warne, a former managing director of Deliveroo, whose first venue Shelter Hall in Brighton opened in the summer, has raised significant new capital as investors recognise “clear trends in the market”. “We’ve seen a huge increase in people wanting to support local and ensure the businesses they love survive,” said Warne. “Our food halls give an opportunity for small food businesses to expand without the usual risk of finding a premises.” With more people regularly working from home, community food halls with an average size of around 12,500 square feet are “modest but effective” redevelopments, with the potential to draw sustainable visitor numbers in urban neighbourhoods or towns of more than 50,000 people, P-Three’s report found. “The regular footfall and spend will act as a catalyst for local regeneration as well as adding value to neighbouring properties making the proposition particularly attractive to both private and public sector landowners and investors,” said Rose. Sheffield’s Cutlery Works demonstrates the strength of the community model, as it has been a success despite being located in a place that is neither central nor affluent. “If food halls are based on location, location, location, we picked the worst one,” jokes the founder Matt Bigland of the area once inhabited by the city’s cutlery-makers.
But Sheffield people “love to champion independents”, says Bigland and instead of office workers and shoppers, Cutlery Works has built a regular clientele that runs the gamut from millennial hot-deskers to grandparents. He thinks that after the pandemic “food halls are going to come back stronger than ever. I think people have a pent-up energy to get back out and be sociable.”"
2021-02-21T12:00:00Z,business,Business,Some businesses are insisting employees get vaccinated for Covid. Should yours? | Gene Marks,"This week a New York City restaurant made news because it allegedly fired an employee because she refused to get vaccinated. According to the New York Times, the waitress, who worked in Brooklyn’s Red Hook Tavern, did not want to get a Covid vaccine shot because she was concerned that the vaccine might affect her chances of becoming pregnant in the future. “I totally support the vaccine,” she said. “If it wasn’t for this one thing, I would probably get it.”
Unfortunately, her bosses saw things differently. The restaurant, which has a policy that requires all of its employees to get vaccinated, terminated the employee. The owner, according to the report, refused to comment on the situation but did say that the restaurant revised its policies to “make it clearer to employees how they could seek an exemption from getting vaccinated”. The situation is one that most businesses – big and small - are already facing, or will face in the weeks ahead: do we terminate an employee who refuses to get a vaccine? Many companies are choosing this route. Other companies are taking the opposite approach and instead offering incentives to those that get the shot. For example, Dollar General, Lidl and others including McDonald’s and Trader Joe’s are actually paying their employees with cash or added time off to get vaccinated. There are even some businesses – like this innovative restaurant in Detroit – that are offering discounts to customers who can show they have done the same. Regardless, every company has to address the issue and have a policy. “My first piece of advice to employers who require vaccinations is to contact your insurance broker and find out exactly what coverages you have that may apply to a mandatory Covid vaccination policy,” said Claude Schoenberg, an employment attorney based in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. “You need to know what protection you might have in case an employee suffers an adverse reaction to a mandated Covid vaccine. You should consider whether that amount of insurance protection is sufficient.” Then there’s the issue of whether just a single one-size-fits-all policy makes sense. Schoenberg is advising his clients to ask themselves whether a Covid vaccination policy would be beneficial to all operations. He suggests considering whether some operations are more safety sensitive than others or if some employees are more at risk than others to contract Covid, based on their work location and proximity to other employees. He also recommends considering what would happen if employees resist vaccination due to their religious leanings or a valid medical reason and also how such a vaccination policy would be implemented. “Will an employer offer Covid vaccination on premises and at employer cost?” he asks. “Will these vaccinations occur during working hours? Will the employer pay employees for time spent receiving a mandatory Covid vaccination?”
All of these considerations, and others, need to be taken into account when coming up with your policy. So what happens if you don’t have a policy? That’s a road some of my clients are taking. “What do I care if an employee gets vaccinated or not?” one owner of a small service company told me this week. “If he or she gets sick, that’s their problem. I know I’ll be getting vaccinated so I won’t likely get sick, and neither will others in my office who do the same.” That approach is also valid, as long as he’s prepared to absorb the not insubstantial costs of an employee who has to miss work due to illness. That’s a reason why some employers, like the restaurant owner in Brooklyn I imagine, are requiring vaccinations of their workers. The bottom line is that the decision whether or not to require your employees to get vaccinated is still up to the owner of the company. There are no federal guidelines that require Covid vaccinations for workers just like there have been none requiring such vaccinations for the flu or shingles. It’s your workplace so you’re free to choose. But, given the unusual nature of a global pandemic and the ongoing uncertainty of its outcome, it’s still probably a good idea to talk to an expert. “Contact your attorney,” says Schoenberg. “You won’t regret investing time and money obtaining trusted advice and counsel concerning such an important decision.”"
2021-02-21T11:00:03Z,business,Business,From the docks to the eBay – will online marketplaces save the fishing industry? ,"On a bracing January morning in Hastings, the British fishing industry feels becalmed. Just weeks after Brexit, exporters are ensnared in red tape, newspapers are full of doom about fish rotting in warehouses, and lorries are being held in two-day queues. Here on the south coast, Covid restrictions have closed most of the shacks that normally dole out oysters, dressed crab, potted shrimp and other local delights. None of the 20 or so boats that make up the Hastings inshore fleet have gone out, either, for a more old-fashioned reason: the weather. It’s rare they are able to fish on more than 150 days of the year, and today is not one of them. There’s a persistent icy drizzle, and a grey sea tumbles chaotically onto the beach. Despite the unpromising conditions, Ben King is trying to see the upside. For the past three years, the start-up he co-founded with Aiden Berry, Pesky Fish, has been working to connect fishermen directly with wholesalers, retailers, restaurants and home chefs, cutting out traditional middlemen. Using Pesky’s online marketplace, a kind of piscine eBay, customers can buy fish from Britain’s inshore fleet as soon as it’s landed, and get it delivered anywhere in the country the next day. Some are offered with a “buy it now” price, algorithmically generated; the rest is sold by auction. The promise is alluring: better value for the customer, the freshest fish going and a higher price for the fishermen. Pesky Fish sells more than two tonnes of fish per day from Britain’s day boats and artisanal fish farmers. “People will paint a dour narrative of the industry, but in a longer-term view, the past couple of months have been amazing,” King says. “We’ve had the opportunity to speak to fishermen and buyers, and ask them what they would want their market experience to be, in an ideal world. We’re at an inflection point. The industry is not going to regress.”
Pesky has come a long way. “I originally wanted to do the seafood version of Flatiron,” says King, alluding to the group of low-cost, high-quality steak restaurants. “It would be financially accessible and also provide a traceability narrative, so you could tell where your fish had come from. It was predicated on my naivety. Slowly I realised that we couldn’t do it in seafood because there wasn’t real traceability in the supply chain. The quality was all over the shop.” He kept asking himself questions. “Why is the fish we eat 2-3 weeks old? Why has it had to pass through four or five pairs of hands to get to my plate? Why is 80% of it imported? It didn’t make sense and it became an itch that never went away.” After delivering its first fish in November 2017, a turbot for Shaun Rankin at Ormer Mayfair in London, Pesky grew quickly, raising money through venture capital and spending time with Techstars, a company that helps start-ups by offering connections and expertise in exchange for equity. Its reputation among chefs spread by word of mouth and an attractive Instagram presence, full of gleaming sides of salmon and grizzled men holding bass. One early adopter was Jeremy Chan, the chef-owner of Ikoyi, the Michelin-starred restaurant in London’s Piccadilly. “It was a different product altogether,” says Chan. “The fish was basically still alive. It started to change our way of working with fish. We became more spontaneous and adaptable, and let them dictate what fish we would put on our menu based on availability. I’d get a call saying: ‘I’ve got a 6kg turbot, do you want it?’ It would be in the restaurant the next evening.” Part of the challenge, he adds, is letting customers know about the quality of what we have on our doorstep: “Britain is a Neanderthal food culture,” he says, “but a bountiful island for seafood and wildlife.”
After starting with individual boats, Pesky has expanded to work with whole ports, Hastings being the most recent addition. At first Berry and King focused on restaurants and wholesalers, but when Covid-19 struck they set up a direct home delivery service, taking advantage of the surge in interest that saw independent food shops’ sales rise more than 63% in the months after lockdown. On the main marketplace, fish is sold in minimum 10kg crates, but the home delivery market allows customers to buy individual fish off the day boats, as well as high-end farmed products, such as mussels from the River Teign, or Wester Ross salmon, smoked with heather honey by Iain Boyd in Ullapool. King says only around half their business is in London, and they’re having as much success outside big cities, where fishmongers have closed and supermarkets might have shut their fish counters. “We were looking for a fish supplier for ages, then we read about Pesky in the Observer [in last year’s OFM50, our annual guide to new people, places and trends],” says Stefano Cuomo, who runs the Macknade artisan food halls in Kent. “We like our produce to have that direct relationship with the community, so customers could engage with the produce and understand it. You can do that online, but really it happens over the counter. We don’t stock tuna or cod, we stock sole and mackerel and cuttlefish, and we can tell customers exactly where it has come from and how to cook it.” The sunlit uplands where British consumers start buying, eating and appreciating their own seafood is simpler in theory than in practice. Pesky is cheaper than most fishmongers, but more expensive than supermarkets. Forty years of integration into the EU means our fish is locked into a labyrinth of regulations, trade agreements and processing systems that will take years to reverse. One gripe from people in the industry is that British fish is more prized on the continent, or even further afield in east Asia or the US, than it is here. Dover sole, crab and lobster are exported to restaurants in Europe, while our cheaper fish is sent to Germany, turned into fish fingers, and reimported. Partly it’s tradition. French restaurants will happily sell four small Dover soles as a dish, while the British customer expects one large fillet. It’s also about tastes. If an agent doesn’t think he can sell a fish to merchants, he won’t buy it off the fishermen. By cutting out intermediary layers, Pesky is helping revive unfashionable options. “Take pouting,” says King. “It used to be a bycatch, but now places like Smoking Goat are using it where they might have used cod. It’s cheaper for the customer, and the overall catch is more valuable.”
Changing customer habits will take time. For now, everyone must contend with Brexit and Covid. “It’s a double sucker-punch,” says Paul Joy, who has been fishing these waters for more than 42 years, and now runs the Hastings Fishermen’s Protection Society from a small office overlooking the beach. A few days before we meet, fishermen protested in Parliament Square against the Brexit agreement, which they feel has betrayed them. Fishing rights were one of the sticking points in the months leading up to the December deadline. Joy and Mark Ball, like most of the industry, were strongly in favour of Brexit, which they hoped might address long-held grievances. Both men started fishing before the UK joined the EU and remember an era before quotas and overfishing and Belgian super-trawlers running up alongside their little boats. “I started when I left school,” says Ball, “and by the time I was 20 I had my own boat. You could make a living. You couldn’t do that today.” Joy agrees. “Before we joined the EU, my family had been fishing here sustainably for 1,000 years,” he says. With the Brexit deal fishermen have ended up with the worst of all worlds. “It’s as bad as it’s ever been. At least with a no deal we’d have had our 12-mile rights. At the moment, we’ve lost everything.” Hastings signed up to Pesky after a venture to run their own wholesaling failed. The Pesky pitch, offering daybook fishermen better prices for their fish and better value to the consumer, was persuasive. They say there have been times when a fisherman would get 20p for a kilogram of lemon sole. Pesky sells them for £4.99 a fish. At some high-end fish shops, a single 500g fish can sell for £14, excluding delivery. “Lots of companies have come and gone, especially the ones that relied on export,” Joy says. “That’s why we were excited to see Pesky come in. They’re looking more at local markets and local consumers. We’ve got to get away from exporting everything we catch.” “We’ve always been non-political,” King says. “We have to create the best opportunities we can, regardless of the situation. We want to make the distribution of value fairer, and push as much value back to the boats who put in such a ridiculous amount of effort.”
Towards the end of last year there was an awful reminder of just how much is at stake for these men and handful of women. In the early hours of November 21 the Joanna C, a 45-foot Brixham scalloper and one of Pesky’s suppliers, sank off the East Sussex coast. The crewmen Robert Morley and Adam Harper drowned; the skipper, Dave Bickerstaff, was rescued after clinging to a buoy, having escaped from underneath the capsized boat and stayed next to Robert in the water for several hours. Morley’s mother, Jackie Woolford, said: “My Robert wasn’t alone when he died. His skipper stayed with him all the time.” “It was a stark reminder that British consumers don’t have any exposure to the risks that come with fishing,” King says. “Nothing can be said or done to make up the loss to those families. But I felt it brought people closer together. It’s why we want to keep promoting the industry and exposing people to the challenges that come with it. If we can make a good thing come of it, that’s the best thing we can do for the fishermen we lost.” The dream of making fishing more efficient has been around for decades. From Marseille to Kerala, there have been experiments and studies in reforming the industry. Although Pesky is the leading British start-up in its field, fishing and aquaculture are attracting attention from entrepreneurs around the world. Sea to Table and Dock to Dish are comparable businesses in the US, while Blue Lobster is doing something similar in Denmark. For the most part, however, start-ups have focused on streamlining the middle sections of the market, rather than the whole ocean-to-plate journey.
Fishing has, so far, proved resistant to change, and is still conducted more or less as it was 100 years ago. Fishermen land their catch, where it is collected by a merchant who sells it on to a wholesaler and then on to individual retailers before it gets to the customer. By the time you’re squeezing a lemon over your bass, it could have been through six or seven hands, each of whom has taken a cut. There is often a complex web of personal loyalties. A chef has often worked with his supplier for years, and the supplier in turn knows to hold back the best fish for the long-term client. Pesky’s supply is necessarily limited by what the boats can catch. It’s great if you’re open-minded about which fish you want, like Chan, but less so if you know you need 200 halibut for Friday night. In a world where everyone has a smartphone, the justification for a byzantine system of middlemen, with layers of bureaucracy between ocean and dinner table, looks increasingly thin. While Paul Joy and Mark Ball hope Pesky can provide better prices for their catch, as well as an effective domestic marketing operation, there is no magic bullet. Pesky is subject to the market like everyone else. It hasn’t dented their ambition.
“The tagline, although I hate that word, is ‘feed the world sustainably with seafood’,” says King. Fish proving difficult to sell to Europe could be exported further afield. Chalk Stream Trout, a Pesky supplier championed by Jamie Oliver and Yotam Ottolenghi, has noticed a rise in sales to the US. If the Pesky system works in the UK, it might also work elsewhere. Its next venture might be to reform tuna markets in Sri Lanka, for example, rather than taking on another British port. By building up a bank of data, King hopes Pesky will one day become a kind of “Bloomberg of fish”, a resource for administrators and officials as well as people wondering what to have for dinner. “Industries evolve on top of themselves, rather than thinking, how would we do it if we were to start again?” he says. “That’s what we have to do: not make incremental benefits of 10% here or there, but ask ourselves how to make it 10 times better. Because that will make it more sustainable in the long run.” Between technology, sustainability, politics and dinner, almost everything has something to do with the price of those annoying fish. • The caption on the first image was amended on 23 February 2021 because an earlier version described the fish as a grey mullet, whereas it is a sea bream."
2021-02-21T10:41:17Z,business,Business,"When Covid infection rates dip, inflation rates may well rise","Andy Haldane caused quite a stir this month when he suggested the economy was like a coiled spring waiting to go off. As the Bank of England’s chief economist has discovered, it’s harder to be a Tigger than an Eeyore. Predictions of impending disaster tend to be forgotten even when they don’t come true. Much less slack is given to those predicting that things will turn out well. Haldane could well be proved right. Consumer and business confidence is on the rise and if – a big if, admittedly – the government continues to support the hardest-hit sectors appropriately as the economy is unshackled, it is quite possible there will be an explosion of pent-up demand.
But even if Haldane is wrong, it’s important to have people making the upbeat case. It would be a much greater cause for concern if all nine members of the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) thought the same way. The dangers of groupthink were well illustrated by the financial crisis of 2008-09. Central bankers, investment bankers, the International Monetary Fund and most of the media believed that liberalisation of the financial system had made it safer, when the opposite was the case. Warning signs from the US housing market were ignored. Dangerous levels of risk-taking was permitted. All sorts of nonsense was peddled about how sophisticated financial instruments that few actually understood would make everybody better off. There was a collective failure to recognise that something could go seriously wrong with a supposedly foolproof model. Eventually it was recognised that herd mentality had led to the near-implosion of the banking system, but only after the event. The MPC’s maverick voice back then was David Blanchflower, who called for much tougher action to deal with the looming crisis. He got it right. Currently, there is quite a lively debate among MPC members about what is likely to happen to the economy. Jan Vlieghe, for example, published a speech last Friday in which he envisaged the possibility of negative interest rates should growth fail to meet the Bank’s expectations. Vlieghe has doubts about whether the economy is going to have a light-switch moment. He is worried that the pandemic will continue to affect activity, either directly through restrictions affecting specific sectors or indirectly by making consumers more cautious. “It is perfectly possible that we have a short period of pent-up demand, after which demand eases back again,” he said. Haldane takes a different view, pointing to a pot of excess savings accumulated over the past year. This stands at an estimated £125bn, and according to the Bank’s chief economist it could double by the end of June. The MPC’s growth projections assume that only 5% of these extra savings will be spent. “I think there is the potential for much more, perhaps even most, of this savings pool to leak into the economy, fuelling a faster recovery,” Haldane said, in his article for the Daily Mail. “Why? Because people are not just desperate to get their social lives back, but also to catch up on the social lives they have lost over the past 12 months. That might mean two pub, cinema or restaurant visits a week rather than one. It might mean a higher-spec TV or car or house.” If Haldane is right, inflation is going to resurface as a headache for central banks much sooner than they – or the financial markets – envisage. Vlieghe said in his speech that he would prefer to keep the current monetary stimulus – 0.1% interest rates and bond buying through the Bank’s quantitative easing programme – in place until 2023-24. Even if the economy performs more strongly than the MPC collectively expects, he would not support tightening policy until well into 2022. Financial markets have got the message. Inflation is not an imminent threat and stimulus will not be withdrawn by central banks until they are sure their economies are well clear of recession. The IMF agrees with that approach. Its chief economic counsellor, Gita Gopinath, said in a blog last week: “The evidence from the last four decades makes it unlikely, even with the proposed fiscal package, that the United States will experience a surge in price pressures that persistently pushes inflation well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.” Now, it is possible that the bullishness of stock markets is justified. Headline inflation rates are low and there is enough slack in labour markets caused by higher unemployment to reduce the chances of a wage-price spiral. As far as central banks and finance ministries are concerned, the risks of doing too little outweigh the risks of doing too much, which is why Rishi Sunak will be pumping more money into the UK economy a week on Wednesday, in the budget.
Yet global share prices are already at record levels after a decade-long run only briefly interrupted by the shock delivered when the pandemic arrived early last year. Much of the money created by central banks over the past 12 months has found its way into asset markets, driving up share and property valuations. Joe Biden’s $1.9tn stimulus package, mentioned by Gopinath, is viewed by the financial markets as another reason to buy shares. Now imagine that the global economy starts to motor as a result of tumbling infection rates and policy support. Central banks are supposed to remove the punch bowl before the party really starts to swing, but delay doing so. Inflation takes hold and the central banks are forced to respond anyway. This would be the trigger for a bear market, perhaps quite a severe one. The idea that financial markets are a one-way bet because central banks can always be relied on to bail them out is groupthink pure and simple. A gentle warning, that’s all."
2021-02-21T07:00:55Z,business,Business,The courts are helping low-paid workers. It’s a shame that the government isn’t,"There will be dismay at the government’s decision to kick its flagship employment bill into the long grass. The legislation was going to be a cornerstone of post-Brexit Britain – one of the building blocks of a better, brighter future along with higher environmental standards and a clampdown on bad corporate behaviour. Now it may make an appearance at the end of the year, though more likely sometime in 2022. Matthew Taylor, one of the driving forces behind the bill in his capacity as Boris Johnson’s employment tsar, says all the ideas he put forward last year have been met with a “stony silence”. In his day job as the head of the RSA, the 260-year-old royal society of arts, manufacturing and commerce, Taylor has built up a sizeable reputation as an innovative thinker. He does not want employment to be thought of as something people only do between 9am and 5pm on a weekday, but neither does he want flexibility to become the parent of a precarious workforce bidding for work by the hour. The former Labour political strategist joined the Johnson bandwagon after the prime minister promised in the December 2019 Queen’s speech to “protect and enhance workers’ rights as the UK leaves the EU, making Britain the best place in the world to work”. Trade unions will not be surprised that the government has failed to match the rhetoric of “build back better” with concrete plans. They are furious about the continued mistreatment of gig-economy workers who are denied basic rights and union representation by employers that in the unions’ view might as well be wearing top hats and smoking cigars, so closely do they resemble Victorian capitalists. The courts are doing their bit. Last week the supreme court said any attempt by organisations to draft artificial contracts intended to sidestep basic protections were unenforceable. Judges had in their sights the contracts issued by the taxi service Uber, which they said stopped workers from claiming basic rights. It is one of a string of cases challenging the self-employed status of gig-economy workers, including action against the minicab firm Addison Lee and the delivery groups CitySprint, Excel and eCourier. As such, the case could have implications for millions of so-called “self-employed” workers. But if Uber’s reaction is anything to go by, an employment bill is urgently needed. The US-based business believes the ruling only applies to a small group of workers from a period when a particular contract was in operation. It denies that a principle has been set. However, it says it has been making “significant changes” and is “committed to doing more”. When Britain is moving into an era of internet shopping, and delivery drivers are a growing element of the workforce, it is clear that the need for greater protection is coming. Prior to the pandemic, less than 20% of retail sales were online. Figures for January showed that the proportion has grown to 35.2%. Keir Starmer, in a speech last week that attempted to reset Labour’s relationship with business, probably reached too far back into history to make his point about the nature of employment. He said: “My dad worked on the factory floor his entire life. A steady, secure job allowed him to build a better life for his family. That’s why, when I think about business I see a source of pride, dignity and prosperity.” Gone are the days when companies could be relied on to keep enough cash in reserve to see staff through the bad times and accept the risk of funding shortfalls in occupational pension schemes. That should not mean employers escape all obligations, and especially not those in low-skilled, low-paid sectors. As Starmer says, this nation needs to provide work that gives pride, dignity and a decent day’s pay. Sterling’s on the comeback trail Not so long ago, there was talk in the currency markets that the pound might sink to parity against the US dollar. It was not hard to find reasons to sell sterling: the pandemic news was terrible; the economy appeared to be on course for a double-dip recession; trade talks with the European Union were going badly. Since the turn of the year, market sentiment towards the pound has improved, culminating in Friday’s move above $1.40 for the first time since 2018. To be fair, some of this has been the result of the weakness of the dollar but it is mostly a UK story. First, the economic impact of Brexit has not been nearly as damaging as it was feared it might be. A bare bones deal between London and Brussels was signed; the M20 has not been turned into a gigantic lorry park; the latest CBI survey of manufacturing pointed to little immediate impact on output from the new trade rules. Second, and much more importantly, the success of the UK’s vaccine programme has come as a pleasant surprise after the frequent policy blunders of 2020. Even though the economy will shrink in the first quarter of 2021, consumer and business confidence has picked up in anticipation of better times to come. Nor are the currency markets overly concerned by the message from the government that the unwinding of lockdown restrictions will be slow and steady. Indeed, the feeling seems to be that the longer consumers are trapped in their homes, the stronger the eventual recovery will be. Put simply, the pound is rising because the flow of bad news has diminished while the flow of good news has increased. Given that it has been trading at historically low levels against the dollar since the 2016 Brexit vote, it could go still higher. Asda’s debt burden could weigh on its prospects It was a brave new world for Asda’s chief executive, Roger Burnley, as ownership of the UK’s third-largest supermarket passed last week from US retail giant Walmart to private equity paymasters, who are saddling the company with debts approaching £4bn. The £6.8bn sale to petrol forecourt billionaires Mohsin and Zuber Issa and TDR Capital has been finalised, although nothing much will now happen until the Competition and Markets Authority gives its verdict on the deal. It is the largest British leveraged buyout in more than 10 years, with the new owners stumping up less than £800m for a controlling stake. Nearly £4bn is being borrowed and £1.7bn raised by selling Asda’s warehouses and petrol stations. The amount of debt being loaded on to the company has raised eyebrows, given that the retailer was struggling in a fiercely competitive grocery market even when it had no debt and £3.5bn of freehold property to its name. Figures published last week showed Asda had an acceptable Christmas trading period but was still the weakest performer among the big four supermarkets. In recent years it has struggled to find a point of difference in a world where the budget chains Aldi and Lidl have stolen its low-price thunder. The Issa brothers, who also used debt to build their EG Group petrol station empire, claim Asda has “exciting future prospects” in their hands. But there are plenty of examples of private equity buyouts that have ended in tears – not least in the case of Debenhams. The entrepreneurs are credited with improving dowdy petrol forecourts with branches of fast-food chains such as KFC and Krispy Kreme, but it is not clear how their expertise helps Asda. On paper it is already a weaker business and Burnley’s fightback looks a whole lot harder."
2021-02-21T07:00:55Z,business,Business,Covid jabs and spending don’t make Johnson a good prime minister | William Keegan,"Philip Stephens, the chief political commentator of the Financial Times, tells a wonderful story about how he was playing football in the playground at school – in those days playground football was with tennis balls – and a ball hit the Latin master as he was passing. The Latin master immediately clipped Stephens round the ears – which, these days, would no doubt have led to the master’s dismissal. Stephens protested: “It wasn’t me, sir.” To which the reply was: “Let this be a lesson to you, my boy. There is no justice in this world.” This story does not appear in Stephens’s new book, Britain Alone – a magnificent account of this benighted country’s downhill path from the enlightened policies of the Attlee government to Suez and then Brexit. But as we continue to experience the mounting horrors of Brexit, Stephens’s anecdote comes to mind: we are being subjected to the worst government in living memory, run by a prime minister for whom only time-servers and the deluded have any respect. And yet: there is no justice in this world! The media are thick with speculation that the mindless bungling that has characterised Johnson’s approach to the Plague counts as nothing when it comes to the apparent success of the vaccine programme. Of course the programme has been impressive so far. But its success has more to do with scientific and medical experts than with Johnson – or, for that matter, with his sidekick Michael “people have had enough of experts” Gove, who has indeed been kicked aside from further negotiations aimed at sorting out the Brexit debacle. And for whom has Gove been set aside, you may ask? Well none other than the hard Brexiter David, now Lord, Frost, who made such a hash of the exit “deal” that an increasing number of small- and medium-sized businesses are now wondering whether they have any commercial future. Frost’s diplomatic career was supposed to have peaked when he was ambassador to Denmark. He then worked for the Scotch Whisky Association before being brought back into government. I wonder what the Scotch Whisky Association makes of the impact his deal has had on its export business? Stephens’s book has been excoriated by rightwing reviewers, no doubt because it lays bare the duplicity of the entire Brexit movement – not least in its obsession with possible new trade deals as opposed to the deals we already had. Then there was the culpable ignorance of what the single market was really about. As Stephens says, Brexiters had a “worldview in which tariffs were the principal impediment to trade, but the reality was that free trading arrangements relied to a much greater extent on regulatory alignment and shared standards and norms”.
And how! Businesses are finding this out the hard way. Moreover, Britain drew most of its overseas income from financial and professional services, which were not subject to tariffs. Then there was the exchequer’s dependence on taxes levied on the financial sector. This was somewhat neglected by Frost’s deal – a point that our Brexiter chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is going to find is a problem when he tries to raise taxes (which he most certainly should not do while the economy continues to suffer from the double whammy of Covid and Brexit). When one considers the combination of Brexit and former chancellor George Osborne’s relentless austerity programme, it almost beggars belief that a civilised country would contemplate re-electing this government. I speak as someone who has counted lots of Conservative politicians, including ministers, among my friends over the years. Alas, too many are no longer with us; but the course on which their once decent party has embarked must be making them turn in their graves. There are legions of examples of how austerity made the Plague so devastating. Do you remember the panic over hospitals? Well, according to Eurostat, in 2018 the UK had 250 available hospital beds per 100,000 inhabitants, compared with 591 in France and 800 in Germany. No wonder there was panic. Yet the government is doing much better in the polls than it deserves, and the leader of the opposition, Keir Starmer, is under attack from all sides. I have even heard wild talk of a snap election on the back of V for Vaccine Victory, although for the life of me I cannot see why a prime minister with such a huge majority should want an election so soon. However, if there is one thing to beware of it is the view that, with unprecedented levels of public spending, the Conservatives have stolen Labour’s clothes. They may have borrowed them, but this is a hardline rightwing government at heart. I find it difficult to believe that the modern Tory party has really had a Damascene conversion. Let us hope that, in the national interest, Starmer can get his act together."
2021-02-21T00:05:46Z,business,Business,Human rights and climate crisis give HSBC an image problem,"HSBC’s chief executive Noel Quinn has had an unenviable first year on the job. In 2020 alone, Quinn rolled out a major restructuring plan that will involve at least 35,000 job cuts, battled the financial impact of Covid in both Asia and Europe, and steered the bank through a geopolitical storm over its response to democracy clashes in Hong Kong. Now he is set to preside over the bank’s second straight year of declining annual profits. HSBC is expected to reveal a 38% drop in pre-tax takings from $13.3bn to $8.3bn when it reports its full-year results on Tuesday. It will be the latest lender stung by a surge in bad debt provisions, meant to protect from potential defaults linked to the pandemic. Those provisions are expected to total $9.1bn for 2020, according to consensus estimates, up from just $2.8bn a year earlier. HSBC bankers are likely see their bonus pool shrink again, following a 3.8% drop to $3.3bn in 2019. Quinn and HSBC’s finance chief Ewen Stevenson have already waived their cash bonus for 2020 and donated 25% of their salaries in light of the Covid crisis. But shareholders are still poised for payouts. HSBC is likely to become the latest UK lender to restart dividend payments after the Bank of England lifted a temporary ban that forced it to scrap a $4.2bn payment to shareholders last spring. That ban was lifted – with limits – in December. The chief executive will give an in-depth business update on Tuesday, one year on from announcing major job cuts and a new strategy. The backdrop is gloomy. In October, Quinn warned that the days of free standard banking for UK customers could be over, as it tries to find new income to compensate for low interest rates. HSBC could come under greater pressure if the Bank of England pushes interest rates below zero later this year.
In the meantime, the London-headquartered bank is likely to face more tough questions on whether it is backing the wrong horse in the battle over Hong Kong. It has faced criticism in the west for supporting China’s controversial security law, and for freezing the accounts of pro-democracy protesters who critics say are the real target of Bejing’s crackdown. MPs on the UK’s foreign affairs committee were left exasperated last month, after Quinn repeatedly refused to comment on issues of “democracy or political systems” and said his main motivation was to help Hong Kong’s economy and its citizens “through the current challenges”. He also ruled out exiting the Hong Kong market, saying it “would only harm” local customers. HSBC makes the majority of its profits in Hong Kong and China. In the UK, HSBC is being targeted by climate campaigners, backed by fifteen pension and investment funds, who want to force the bank to slash its exposure to fossil fuels – starting with coal – within a timeline consistent with Paris climate goals. They a have filed the second-ever climate vote at a major UK bank, following a similar resolution tabled at Barclays’ AGM last year. While HSBC has pledged to shrink its carbon footprint to net zero by 2050, the current climate plan stops short of a blanket ban on financing coal power, and does not allow it to turn away clients or cancel contracts based on their fossil fuel exposure. HSBC is Europe’s second-largest financier of fossil fuels after Barclays, according to the Rainforest Action Network (RAN). The vote isn’t until May, so investors will have to wait to see whether HSBC will support the resolution, or follow Barclays’ lead and table an alternative proposal."
2021-02-20T19:00:41Z,business,Business,"Australia's recovery appears to be going well, but it's still very weird out there | Greg Jericho","In this whacky state of affairs we live in, where lockdowns can happen mid-way through tennis matches, and where travelling to and from various states and locales can stop and start with next to no warning at times, it is little wonder that the economy seems rather discombobulated. The good news is things are improving. The bad news is we’re still in an employment recession. The unemployment rate in January of 6.4% is still 1.3% pts above the lowest rate in the past 12 months – a level that is a recession in anyone’s language regardless of what is happening with the GDP.
But things are better than they were. At the worst stage last year the unemployment rate had risen 2.4% pts above the lowest rate of the past 12 months. That improvement however is not terribly uniform – some states and age groups are doing better while others are clearly worse off. Take men aged 35-44 – there are actually 0.8% more of them now employed than there were in March last year. So that’s great. Yes, there are issues around full-time work being replaced with part-time, but more employment is as a rule better than less – especially during a recession. And yet employment for men aged 45-54 is still down 1.5% of March last year. The same goes for women – those aged 35-44 have seen employment go up since March, those aged 45-54 have lost work. And yet it is not older workers who are losing out – there are more men and women aged over 55 employed now than before the pandemic. It is, shall we say, a bit nutty. There’s also the weird issue of hours worked. Generally as goes employment so go hours worked. This makes sense – if more people are working you would expect more hours to be worked. Except in January while overall employment increased 0.2%, the hours worked fell 4.9% - the second biggest fall ever recorded.
Graph not displaying correctly? Click here It meant that the average monthly hours worked per capita fell from 83.9 in December to 79.7 – back to around where we were in June. So does this mean the recovery is over and we have hit a wall? Normally it would, but we are of course not living in normal times. Some of the drop in hours worked can be placed on New South Wales and the lockdowns that affected parts of greater Sydney in the early part of January. And yet every state saw a fall in the number of hours worked – even Victoria which had a 1.3% increase in employment as it (for a time at least) became free of lockdowns. But while this drop in hours worked is not a sign that the recovery is over, it is a sign that the economy remains utterly affected by the pandemic. The main reason for the drop in hours worked is that people took a lot of time off – and a lot more than they usually do in January. The reason they did so is because, as many of you will no doubt have gathered from messages being sent around your workplaces from the executive and bosses, companies have been scrambling to get leave that has not been taken off their books. This is applied across all industries – January is a down period – a good period to catch up on repairs, filing, internal reviews etc, and a good time to take leave. And this year a lot more people than recently decided to do so. In January nearly 900,000 more people took leave than did a year ago, and 720,000 more people than in January 2020 worked zero hours in the month because they were on leave. Overall, just a quarter of everyone employed worked zero hours in January – but just 3.2% were doing so because there was not enough work. So that means there was a big drop in hours worked but not necessarily a big drop in actual work to do. And while this suggests the recovery out of the recession appears to be still going well, it highlights that things are still very much weird out there. And until all government pandemic related subsidised such as jobkeeper are removed it will remains tough to know just how strong or weak the recovery will be."
2021-02-20T17:00:37Z,business,Business,Tobacco giant bets £1bn on influencers to boost 'more lung-friendly' sales,"Flashing an ice-white smile for her 50,000 followers on TikTok, a fresh-faced young woman pops a flavoured nicotine pouch into her mouth, as one of Pakistan’s most popular love songs plays in the background. More than 3,000 miles away, in Sweden, another social media starlet lip-syncs for the camera, to a different pop tune. The same little pouches, made by British American Tobacco, appear in shot. Critics say that such viral videos, even if they aren’t paid-for adverts, are the consequence of a global marketing push designed to offset dwindling cigarette consumption by recruiting the nicotine consumers of the future. BAT has embarked on a £1bn campaign that harnesses the popular appeal of social media influencers, pop stars and sporting events. According to a wide-ranging report by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, it has also attracted younger adults, non-smokers and even reached the eyes of children. An employee of a public relations firm engaged by BAT in Kenya was so concerned about the bureau’s report into its marketing practices that they offered a reporter a bribe for inside information about it. BAT has cut ties with the company concerned and is investigating the incident. But it stands by the marketing practices that it hopes will capture the fast-growing stream of revenue from e-cigarettes and vapes – not to mention the nicotine pouches beloved of TikTok influencers. BAT makes much of how such products are helping adult smokers switch to less harmful alternatives, under the slogan “A Better Tomorrow”. By 2023, the company expects to be targeting 500 million nicotine consumers with £100bn a year to spend. Products other than cigarettes are driving much of that growth.
Financial results released last week showed an annual pre-tax profit of £8.7bn as “non-combustible” products began contributing to earnings for the first time. The number of customers using them jumped by 3 million to 13.5 million, as the pandemic sparked a migration from cigarettes to more lung-friendly nicotine-delivery methods. However, such products are far from risk-free and the trend for promoting them via social media and popular influencers is causing concern. TikTok videos featuring attractive young people promoting BAT’s nicotine pouches, under the brand names Velo and Lyft, seem to have gone down particularly well with youngsters. The caption on one TikTok video from Sweden in which Lyft pouches feature prominently, reads: “Every basic bitch in Sweden between the age of 14 and 23.” Clad in futuristic packaging, they are seen as a fresh alternative to more traditional tobacco pouches known as “Snus”. One 18-year-old told the bureau that half the girls in his class were using Lyft, which they found much more appealing, partly thanks to paid partnerships with Instagram influencers. “Lyft has got this super-cool influencer-aura about it,” he said. Lyft has no tobacco in it but does contain nicotine, making it an over-18s product. Yet multiple TikTok videos feature Swedes who appear to be of school age using them. The hashtag #lyftsnus has nearly 13 million views. In the US and Europe, BAT has told regulators that nicotine products are intended to help adult smokers replace cigarettes. That’s somewhat at odds with a slide from a 2019 presentation to investors, entitled “Nicotine consumer pool continues to grow”. It shows that the number of nicotine users was falling until 2012, before rebounding strongly. The slide boasts of “8m NGP [next-generation product] consumers added in 2017”. The company certainly seems to be after new nicotine users, rather than just people quitting smoking. Its marketing campaign for Velo in Pakistan, using the hashtag #openthecan on Facebook and Instagram, used 40 influencers, garnering more than 13 million views.
In Spain, a campaign for BAT’s heated tobacco product Glo has been fronted by boy band Dvicio, via Instagram and a series of concerts. The “boys” are all in their late 20s or early 30s, but were last year’s summer cover stars for tween magazine Like! And in Pakistan, brand representatives working on commission, handed out samples at parties, shopping malls, tea shops and tobacconists. One 17-year-old in Pakistan told the bureau they were offered a free sample without being asked for ID. On an official Velo social media account, another Pakistani man confided that Velo was his first dalliance with nicotine. The company responded, saying it was “so excited”. BAT said its products were “for adults only and we believe that youth should never use any nicotine product.” “We’re clear that all marketing activity for our products will only be directed towards adult consumers and isn’t designed to engage or appeal to youth; it must be accurate, and not misleading; and that it is made clear that it originates from BAT. Our social media accounts are age-gated so they are only visible to those users who have confirmed that they are 18+ (or other applicable minimum age),” it said. The company added it was essential it marketed “reduced-risk” products so smokers were aware of them. Taylor Billings, of Corporate Accountability, said social media campaigns were bound to reach a young audience. “The tobacco industry is too well resourced for things to be a coincidence,” she said. “They are not accidentally placing shiny adverts on a platform that have a vast percentage of its users as Gen Z or young millennials.” One of BAT’s shinier campaigns is a partnership with Formula One, which banned tobacco advertising in 2006 but still permits nicotine products. A tie-up with McLaren includes Vuse e-cigarettes and Velo branding on drivers’ uniforms and cars. BAT also sponsors F1 e-sports events that are streamed live on YouTube. Although viewers had to register as over-18 to watch, during one tournament several viewers revealed that they were underage. The sponsorship campaign even stretches to a deal with Rudimental, the drum’n’bass band. McLaren said marketing activities helped raise awareness of less-risky products and were “only directed towards existing adult nicotine consumers”. BAT’s own investor presentations show that at least half of users of nicotine pouches and vapourisers are “new entrants”. During a video update on BAT’s progress, Paul Lageweg, director of new categories, boasted of the appeal of nicotine pouches among adult Gen Z (born between 1997 and 2012) and millennials.
He identified Pakistan and Kenya as BAT’s most exciting trial markets. The exciting opportunity in Kenya included the sale of Lyft via online retailer Jumia, where it was categorised as a party product. On another website, customers were directed to products they might also like, such as Dunhill and Sportsman cigarettes. Bureau journalist Edwin Okoth was investigating this when he was offered a bribe by an employee of Engage BCW, affiliated with global advertising giant WPP. In text messages, the employee asked Okoth, “What is your price?” for leaking information about the investigation, confirming the offer was “serious”. They went on to say that the bribe was part of a “media intelligence” gathering operation that would help them “manage the client”, meaning BAT. BAT said it had ceased activities with BCW Kenya and had launched an investigation into the incident. Engage BCW said it had a “zero-tolerance policy towards any form of bribery or unethical conduct”. A spokesperson added: “All our employees undergo mandatory anti-bribery training and are obliged to sign our code of conduct confirming their adherence to it. “We are committed to the highest standards of behaviour in all our work and we take this issue extremely seriously. We have immediately commenced an internal investigation and suspended the employee concerned pending its outcome.” A TikTok spokesperson said: “We strictly prohibit content that depicts or promotes the possession or consumption of tobacco and drugs by minors. We will remove accounts that are identified as being dedicated to promoting vaping, and we do not allow ads for vaping products or nicotine pouches.” Additional reporting by Edwin Okoth, Ann Törnkvist, Anmol Irfan and Umar Cheema"
2021-02-20T16:00:36Z,business,Business,Drug companies look to AI to end 'hit and miss' research,"The hunt for new medicines has often been more like a game of roulette than high-end science. But now the pharmaceutical sector is on the cusp of a transformation, as it delves into cutting-edge technology to come up with new treatments for diseases such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer’s. Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to improve the industry’s success rates and speed up drug discovery, potentially saving it billions of dollars, a recent survey by the analytics firm GlobalData has found. AI topped a list of technologies seen as having the greatest impact on the sector this year. Almost 100 partnerships have been struck between AI specialists and large pharma companies for drug discovery since 2015. AI uses automated algorithms – sets of instructions that computers follow – to perform tasks previously done by humans. It can sift quickly through large datasets (from clinical studies and scientific literature) to detect hidden patterns, and perform tasks within seconds that would usually take months. A study in the Lancet found AI software could identify breast cancers that were missed by doctors in mammograms. In a process known as machine learning, AI systems run through millions of possibilities, improving each time, until they are able to perform acceptably. The output of that training is an algorithm. “Drug discovery is being transformed through the use of AI, which is reducing the time it takes to mine the vast amounts of scientific data to enable a better understanding of disease mechanisms and identify new potential drug candidates,” says Karen Taylor, director of the Centre for Health Solutions at accounting and consultancy group Deloitte. “Traditional drug discovery has been very fragmentary, very hit and miss,” she adds. Taylor says the rapid progress of Covid-19 vaccines and potential treatments has been aided by the use of AI techniques. “It allows you to cross-reference a lot of published literature with other data within seconds.” Kitty Whitney, director of thematic research at GlobalData, says the Covid-19 crisis could be a “tipping point” for widespread adoption across the pharma industry. About 90% of large pharmaceutical firms initiated AI projects last year, according to the US research firm Trinity Life Sciences. AstraZeneca and GSK, Britain’s two biggest drugmakers, committed in November to a five-year partnership with Cambridge University to fund the Cambridge Centre for AI in Medicine. The 15-strong team will develop AI and machine-learning technologies to improve clinical trials, personalised medicine and drug discovery.
GSK had previously opened a £10m AI research base in King’s Cross, central London, near Google’s DeepMind AI lab. Its global team of AI experts has grown to 50 people, which it wants to double to 100. Functional genomics – a new area of science that looks at why small changes in a person’s genetic make-up can increase the risk of diseases – deals with huge datasets. Each person has about 30,000 genes, which can be combined with others, as Hal Barron, GSK’s chief scientific officer, explains. “You start to realise you’re dealing with trillions and trillions of data points, even per experiment, and no human can interpret that, it’s just too complicated.” Large pharmaceutical companies have been criticised for being slow to embrace technological advances. Drug discovery has a woefully low success rate – of 10 drugs in development, nine will typically fail; it takes 10-12 years on average, and comes with a high cost, of more than $2bn, to take a medicine through research and development and regulatory approval. Conventional drug discovery has been compared to a “molecular casino” by Alex Zhavoronkov, an expert in the use of AI for developing new drugs, who runs Hong Kong-based Insilico Medicine. GSK’s Barron reckons the use of AI technologies could at least double the success rate to 20%, which would save billions of dollars spent on drug development. Others, like Zhavoronkov, hope the success rate could improve much more, potentially to 50%. All of the world’s top 10 drugmakers – the Swiss firms Novartis and Roche; the US companies Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, AbbVie and Bristol Myers Squibb; France’s Sanofi; and the UK’s AstraZeneca and GSK – are now investing in AI, mainly through collaborations, or by acquiring technologies. Kim Branson, GSK’s global head of AI and machine learning, says AI is being used in the search for treatments for infectious diseases, as well as for diseases that are harder to crack such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune disorders such as Crohn’s. Alzheimer’s– “the hardest of the hard targets” – is on GSK’s radar but will be tackled at a later stage. Zhavoronkov says the problem with Alzheimer’s and the brain disorder Parkinson’s disease is that there is not enough data available to study them, hence the large number of drug failures to date. Zhavoronkov and Barron have expressed confidence that a major breakthrough in one of the harder-to-research diseases can be achieved with AI technologies. Barron compares the potential to having a new microscope. “Within the next year or two we might find a target that really can make a difference.”"
2021-02-20T16:00:36Z,business,Business,Ports feel the chill as trade re-routes around Brexit Britain,"Perched on the shores of Anglesey, the island linked by road bridges to the north-west coast of Wales, Holyhead’s geography has given it a leading role in British-Irish trade since the early 19th century. About 50 miles directly across the Irish Sea from Dublin, a journey of just three-and-a-quarter hours by ferry, Holyhead was until December the second busiest roll-on roll-off port in the UK after Dover. About 450,000 trucks rumbled through each year on their way to Dublin, with cargoes of meat and agricultural produce, secondhand cars and items destined for the shelves of Irish supermarkets. But the UK’s departure from the EU has changed all that. In just seven weeks, freight volumes have plunged by 50%. The port’s owner, Stena Line, part of the shipping line owned by the Swedish Olsson family, is warning that the slump could be permanent. Local politicians and businesses say jobs are now at risk. In this red-wall seat, where at the last general election a Conservative MP was sent to parliament for the first time since 1983, about 1,000 jobs depend on the port, 250 of them directly. Rhun ap Iorwerth is member of the Senedd (Welsh parliament) for Ynys Môn, the Welsh name for Anglesey. His great-grandfather worked on the docks at Holyhead, and he is fearful of the damage already done. “Any reduction in numbers of sailings, any reduction in ship capacity, can only mean one thing for the port of Holyhead and that’s jobs going,” said the Plaid Cymru politician.
A combination of pre-Brexit stockpiling and Covid have suppressed some trade, but that doesn’t tell the whole story. Hauliers, it seems, are avoiding the port in order to swerve the barricade of red tape now erected between Great Britain and Ireland. Before Brexit, hauliers in Northern Ireland would often prefer to drive to Dublin, where frequent sailings meant they would rarely wait long for a ferry to Holyhead, while Irish produce destined for the continent would go to Anglesey, before making its way across England and then the Channel. For years, this so-called UK “land bridge” has been the quickest and most economical route from Ireland to France and beyond. Lorries filled with agricultural products such as beef and vegetables would leave Ireland for the continent, and on their return journey drop items off in Britain before picking up produce to take back to supermarkets in both the Republic and Northern Ireland. Now, many Northern Irish lorries destined for Great Britain are opting to sail from Belfast to Liverpool or Cairnryan in Scotland to avoid crossing the EU border. Meanwhile, the land bridge, which accounted for around a third of trucks passing through Holyhead, is fast being replaced by sailings direct from Ireland to France. “I used to be at this port three or four times a week, but not as much since January,” said driver Mateusz Kozlowski, 33, carrying goods for the retail giant Amazon from one of its UK warehouses. He echoed the experience of other hauliers parked in a queue on the windswept quay for the 14.45 sailing to Dublin. “I am travelling more to Cairnryan, it’s longer work,” said Stephen Connor, also transporting Amazon parcels, for Northern Irish logistics firm Manfreight. Kozlowski and Connor had both been delayed at customs, meaning they had missed the 9am sailing and were being forced to wait nearly six hours for the next boat. “Before Christmas I would have been on the 0900,” said Connor.
Red tape has also affected Fishguard in south-west Wales, another of Stena Line’s ports. Freight from southern Ireland would previously have arrived here from Rosslare, but traffic has been down on average 50% since January. Ferry operators have spotted an opportunity, and have started to offer direct services from Dublin and Rosslare on Ireland’s south-east coast to Dunkirk or Cherbourg in France, bypassing the UK entirely. “Enjoy simple cross-border passage inside the EU market,” Danish ferry operator DFDS promises on its website, advertising its Rosslare-Dunkirk freight route, which launched at the end of 2020. It is currently offering six of these sailings per week, each able to carry up to 125 lorries, and all have been sold out since it started. The sea journey takes almost 24 hours, could be affected by rough weather, and currently costs €300-€400 more than the Dublin-Holyhead crossing, but business is booming. Stena itself has added extra sailings from Ireland to France and has seen a “huge increase” in demand, despite the journey taking six hours longer than the land bridge, according to Ian Davies, head of UK port authorities at the company. He says the market has probably doubled or trebled in size, although it remains comparatively small. Hauliers are doing it “because they need certainty”, he says. “There was great fear in the Irish haulage industry that Dover-Calais would be a bottleneck. A lot of them are saying [sailing from Ireland to France] is not the most efficient way – it is more costly – but currently they are prepared to pay that premium.”
However, Davies warns the shift may lead to trade imbalance, as Ireland exports more to the EU than it imports. “This is where the land bridge works. It may work [travelling] direct from Ireland to France, but the return loads are often dropping off in the UK, before then picking up to take back to Ireland. We know now there are a lot of empty units going back and forth, and that is not sustainable.” Such warnings are doing little to calm nerves on Anglesey. Britain’s membership of the single market has, over the years, brought 700% growth in traffic to Holyhead, according to ap Iorwerth. That is now under threat: “Whichever way you look at it, Holyhead loses out. We can only hope to goodness that this is temporary.” Before Brexit, the major concern for Holyhead residents and the Welsh government was that customs delays would lead to queues of lorries containing perishable goods clogging the town’s roads. A lorry-stacking area was prepared on the dual carriageway outside the port. But the roads are quiet, and the contraflow system has been dismantled.
While environmental campaigners might like to see fewer freight vehicles travelling on Britain’s motorways on their way to the continent, a lasting downturn at the port would be a fresh blow for Anglesey’s economy, hot on the heels of the decision last year by Hitachi to pull the plug on its planned £16bn new nuclear power station on the island at Wylfa. “Without the port there is nothing left,” said Arfon Morris, 56, owner of the Boathouse hotel, which has been providing rooms during lockdown for essential workers to try to make up for almost a year without tourists. “I worry about the next generation,” Morris added. “Where are these young people going to get jobs from?” The local MP, Virginia Crosbie, insists she is confident about Holyhead’s long-term future. “We just need to minimise disruption,” she said. “I will be talking to the UK government to press for more clarity and more ease of travel.” Yet many locals feel forgotten about by both the Welsh and UK governments – with both Cardiff and London a more than a four-hour drive away. “Both governments are in the south,” said local councillor Bob Llewelyn Jones, whose ward includes the port. “We really need a shot in the arm here, we need something.” The port of Dover reported earlier in February that freight traffic volumes between the UK and the EU had returned to 90% of levels normally seen at this time of year, higher than the UK government’s estimate of 82%. In Holyhead, locals fear these figures mask the drop-off in land-bridge traffic and wonder if changes in freight routes could see the port bypassed for good."
2021-02-20T08:00:26Z,business,Business,No more fomo: top firms turn to VR to liven up meetings,"Staff at accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers have been holding meetings in odd places: the top of skyscrapers, inside swanky penthouse apartments and even luxury ski chalets. All without leaving the comfort of their own homes. That is the new normal for a growing number of workers at PwC, which is buying thousands of virtual reality headsets to help battle Zoom fatigue and level the playing field for employees barred from entering the same room during the Covid outbreak. It is latest example of how firms are adapting to remote working, after the Covid-19 epidemic cancelled international client meetings and consigned white-collar workers to their kitchen tables. A recent poll by recruiter Robert Half found that 89% of businesses expect hybrid working – split between home and office – to become permanent after the pandemic, prompting investment in new technology, and offices that can offer more to staff than a desk and a wifi signal. “What’s interesting is you’ve had a bunch of technologies around to enable remote working for quite a while,” Nick South, a partner and expert in the future of work at Boston Consulting Group (BCG), said. “It took this mass shift to remote work in general for firms to say ‘Oh, actually, let’s try and apply it at scale’.” PwC first piloted the use of VR headsets in the UK in 2017, but after the pandemic forced its 22,000 staff to work from home, it accelerated hybrid working plans. Its UK operation is already running two to three team meetings via VR each week. Over the next 18 months, it is spending £75m to redesign offices with cafe-style meeting areas and equip staff with new tech. That will include higher grade microphones, video meeting screens, and doubling its own cache of VR headsets to 400 by the end of the year, to help remove the disadvantage of logging in from home.
“If you’re the only person on [Google] Hangouts, you’re guaranteed new elements of a ‘fear of missing out’,” PwC UK’s chief executive, Kevin Ellis, said. “Therefore, it’s really important that our meeting rooms are able to level the playing field.” One PwC staffer recalled leading a presentation for a furniture company through its VR headsets. Held in the grand hall of a virtual conference centre, participants were able to conjure furniture designs out of thin air and allow clients to view them in real time. “It’s really quite strange but very interesting,” Ellis said, adding that he hopes new tech will help cut down on international travel post-pandemic, and improve work-life balance by reducing commuting. BCG’s own research found that 86% of UK workers claimed to have benefited from remote working, saying they were less distracted and had a better work-life balance.
However, 79% also experienced negative impacts, including anxiety, loneliness and increasingly blurred boundaries between home and work. There is also a risk that staff – especially those under 35 – feel less visible to bosses, and miss out on informal training by being around their peers and seniors along the way. “The thing that people have really struggled with is on-the-job learning and apprenticeship, which you do get by being side-by-side and face-to-face with colleagues,” South said. Nicholas Bloom, British economist at Stanford University, has been researching the effects of home working for years before the pandemic hit. He strongly advises that companies offer remote working at least one or two days a week. His own surveys found that staff preferred the arrangement, and would probably demand 8% higher pay if refused. They were also more productive, which was good for the corporate bottom line. However, Bloom advises against letting staff ditch the office entirely. Working from home is like beer or wine – it is great in moderation but is not so great in excess. One to three days a week seems to be the sweet spot. A few firms are planning five days a week post-pandemic but I think that is risky and problematic. It is hard to innovate remotely, it is hard to maintain company culture and it can make employees feel lonely and isolated.” Some firms such as digital bank Revolut are now overhauling offices to push more of its staff together after the Covid pandemic recedes. The fintech firm is redesigning all 23 of its global sites – including its headquarters in London’s Canary Wharf – by halving the number of individual desks from about 2,800 to roughly 1,400 over the next few years. It will instead dedicate 70% of office space for meeting rooms and group seating, while reserving some “quiet zones” for staff.
While this will help reduce square footage in some offices, Revolut said it was not a cost-cutting exercise and would only represent “marginal savings”. “In most cases, people are not primarily looking at [hybrid working arrangements] from a cost point of view. They’re fundamentally thinking, ‘How do we as an organisation want to work in the future’?” South said. Earlier this month, the 335-year-old insurance market Lloyd’s of London launched a consultation into how its iconic Grade I-listed building at 1 Lime Street will be used after the pandemic. The market – which hosted 6,000 of its 45,000 workers, brokers and underwriters on any given day before Covid – is asking how members plan to use spaces that are usually booked for meetings, training and events, as well as its cafe and wellness centre (reserved for yoga, meditation and simple medical issues) given hybrid-working plans and the “career aspirations” of their members.
Lloyd’s is also reviewing the “future purpose and role” of its physical underwriting room, which has been off limits for most of the pandemic and temporarily replaced with a digital version that helped shift more of its complex insurance negotiations online last year. Firms that fail to consider hybrid working models not only risk losing talented workers to more progressive employers, but are also cutting themselves off from a more diverse pool of staff, who might – for example – live outside London but would consider commuting twice a week. “The expectations are shifting quite fast, and the examples of people doing things differently are appearing all the time. So actually, [businesses] need to start doing their thinking now,” South said."
2021-02-20T00:01:16Z,business,Business,Pub and travel bosses demand plan for easing lockdown in England,"Pub and travel bosses have demanded that the prime minister produce a detailed roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions in England, amid mounting friction between the government and business leaders. Ahead of an update on the government’s plans, due on Monday, increasingly irate pub executives urged Boris Johnson to mend fences with the industry by offering clarity about the way forward. Separately, in a letter to the prime minister, the travel industry warned “we cannot wait for the full rollout of the vaccination programme before people start to travel again”.
It comes after a group of pub chain chief executives withdrew from weekly talks with officials at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), citing a “lack of interest and respect”. Several said said they were still in the dark about ministers’ plans since the breakdown of talks, instead hearing secondhand about proposals that have caused dismay, such as opening pubs without alcohol, or allowing outside service only. Chris Jowsey, the boss of the 1,000-strong pub chain Admiral, said: “They release things in the press and if they get a bad reaction they change their mind. “To my knowledge there’s no meaningful consultation going on at any level.” Relations between the pub sector and government worsened further this week after industry figures took umbrage at Johnnson’s claim that hospitality poses a high risk of coronavirus infection. As hospitality figures lamented a lack of government engagement, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, came in for criticism on social media over an interview with TV chief Gordon Ramsay.
Pub bosses pointed out that they had enjoyed no such dialogue. “We’ve got 3.5 million people waiting to hear if their jobs are safe and we can’t tell them. That’s pretty shocking,” said Patrick Dardis, boss of the 300-strong pub chain Young’s. He said ministers had a “Victorian perception” of pubs because they do not visit them apart from at elections and do not understand that modern venues can open safely. Dermot King, the boss of pub chain Oakman Inns, said the lack of communication was symptomatic of the government’s approach throughout the pandemic, citing a list of policies that have angered bosses. “The whole Scotch egg debacle was never discussed with the industry, the 10pm curfew was never discussed before it was introduced,” he said. “Opening up but only with beer gardens was not discussed, or even the concept – which I have to believe was made up – of pubs reopening without selling alcohol. “It indicates that somebody in government isn’t taking the problem seriously enough.” A BEIS spokesperson said the department would “continue to engage relentlessly with the hospitality sector, as we have done throughout this pandemic, and our door remains firmly open”. The travel industry swung behind calls for a gradual return to business as usual, in its own open letter to the prime minister, arguing it cannot wait for the full rollout of the vaccination programme before people start to travel again.
The industry, led by travel agents’ body Abta and including travel firms Tui, easyJet and Jet2, called for recognised vaccine certificates that would allow people to make journeys before everyone has been vaccinated. They also want the Foreign Office to restore travel guidance based on regional Covid-19 data, so that people can travel to areas of other countries where infection rates are low without facing quarantine restrictions. They also called for increased financial support for businesses facing restrictions, a call echoed by a third letter to the prime minister from the Events Industry Alliance, which represents exhibition and event firms."
2021-02-19T15:12:06Z,business,Business,Pound hits $1.40 on vaccine optimism; UK retail sales tumble 8.2% – as it happened,"The pound has powered past $1.40 for the first time in almost three years and has clawed most of the losses suffered since the Brexit vote in June 2016. It hit $1.4036, the highest level since 20 April, 2018, and is getting closer to $1.4860, the level it was at a day before the the referendum result was announced. So far this year, sterling has gained 2.7% against the dollar, and it is the best-performing G10 currency. It has been lifted by the UKâ€™s rapid vaccination drive, which has raised hopes of economic recovery in the months ahead. The jump in the pound came despite a sharp decline in UK retail sales in January during the lockdown. The UK government borrowed Â£8.8bn in January, the first January deficit in 10 years, and the biggest borrowing since records began in 1993. Stock markets are grinding higher in Europe and the US, buoyed by vaccine optimism. Bitcoin has hit a fresh record high, rising 2.6% to $52,932, putting it on course for a weekly gain of over 8%. It has gained 60% in value so far this month and its market value is approaching $1 trillion. Today is an exciting day for anyone working in the gig economy. Uber has lost its appeal in the UKâ€™s Supreme Court against a landmark employment tribunal ruling that its drivers should be classed as workers with access to the minimum wage and paid holidays. The decision has legal consequences for the pensions and benefits entitlements for these workers. Richard Lee, a partner at the law firm Gowling WLG, says: This decision is the final confirmation that individuals working for Uber (and other businesses using this working model) are to be treated as workers and depending on the level of earnings they will now be entitled to be enrolled into an appropriate pension arrangement with minimum contributions of 3% from their employer. It is one of a string of cases challenging the self-employed status of gig-economy workers, including action against the minicab firm Addison Lee and the delivery groups CitySprint, Excel and eCourier.

2021-02-19T15:11:06Z,business,Business,NatWest to cut banker bonus pool as it reports £351m loss,"NatWest has cut its banker bonus pool to the lowest level since its financial crisis bailout, after swinging to a full-year loss in 2020. The lender – formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland – slumped to a loss of £351m for 2020 compared with a profit of £4.2bn a year earlier. The bank was stung by a surge in bad debt provisions, having put aside £3.2bn to cover a potential jump in defaults because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The loss ends three straight years of profit for the lender, which has struggled to stay out of the red since its £45bn bailout in 2008. The bonus pool for NatWest bankers has been cut by 33% as a result, leaving staff to share £206m. It is the lowest total since it came into state ownership at the height of the financial crisis. A total of 803 employees earned more than £250,000 last year. NatWest also confirmed on Friday that it was intending to pull out of the Republic of Ireland after 160 years, with plans to wind down and sell assets from its Ulster Bank operations after an “extensive” review. Alison Rose, the NatWest chief executive, said: “It has become clear Ulster Bank will not be able to generate sustainable long terms returns for our shareholders. As a result, we are to begin a phased withdrawal from the Republic of Ireland over the coming years, which will be undertaken with careful consideration of the impact on customers and our colleagues.” The NatWest chairman, Howard Davies, said the Irish government had not welcomed the news but had supported a potential sale of a €4bn (£3.5bn) loan book and some staff to the countries largest lender, Allied Irish Banks. It is also in early-stage discussions to sell assets to other potential buyers including Permanent TSB. Ireland’s finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, said in a statement it was a “significant event” and “the Irish banking landscape will be poorer for the loss of Ulster Bank after all these years”.
NatWest, which is still 62% taxpayer-owned, paid Rose £2.6m for 2020. She gave up a quarter of her fixed pay last year, which was taken out of her annual share allowance, and waived her long-term bonus for 2020 – which will be reflected in her 2023 pay packet. Davies, who also donated part of his pay, confirmed there were no plans to extend their salary sacrifice this year. The bank is restarting its dividend after the Bank of England lifted its temporary ban on shareholder distributions in December to allow limited payouts. NatWest’s rival Barclays has also resumed payouts. NatWest plans to pay out £364m to shareholders, meaning £225m will go to the Treasury. The bank has also pledged to distribute at least £800m a year to shareholders until 2023.
Rose is planning to cut costs furtherby 4% a year, by bringing more of its customer processing online and reviewing its property footprint as the lender ramps up hybrid working arrangements in response to the pandemic. Rose did not rule out branch closures but said those decisions would be driven by customer use. NatWest shares were up 4% at 178p on Friday. The central bank’s dividend ban last year meant scrapping a £968m shareholder payout, including £600m worth of dividends to the Treasury. The move was designed to give banks a larger cushion to weather the economic downturn of the Covid crisis."
2021-02-19T12:46:26Z,business,Business,"UK shoppers, like British businesses, need more reassurance from the chancellor","Retail sales figures for January will give the Treasury a fright. A fall of 8% was much larger than the more modest 3% expected by City economists and reveals how shoppers, when confronted by a third lockdown, were reluctant to keep calm and carry on. There was a faint hope that after a disastrous Christmas period, and a year that ranked as the worst for consumer spending on record, we might see retailers start 2021 with a fresh set of wings. It was not to be. While the slump in spending was not as great as during the first lockdown, any hopes of a milder drop in sales were snuffed out by the closure of all non-essential shops and the daily reports of rising infection levels and cases of Covid-19 that made it clear the lockdown would last for several months. Another factor preying on the minds of consumers was government resistance to upgrading its financial support package. Calls to extend the uplift in universal credit beyond April, and likewise the furlough scheme, have been rebuffed so far.
Rishi Sunak is wedded to the idea that the best chancellor is one who makes clear they will adapt policies to match the course of the pandemic. What he has never seemed to realise is that a flexible approach can be viewed as procrastination and indecision. Understandably, retailers and consumers would be reassured and have greater confidence if he offered a longer-term commitment. The hope must be that next week, in the run-up to the budget on 3 March, Sunak agrees to go further and commit further funds to his broader rescue package. According to the latest public finance figures, there is little excuse for him to hold back. The Office for National Statistics estimates that borrowing over the 10 months from April 2020 to January 2021 was £270bn, about £70bn below the latest forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury’s independent forecaster. This calculation leaves out the likely cost of writing off billions of pounds of business loans made by the Treasury in the first months of the pandemic. The loan losses could add a further £30bn to the total. Yet the overall deficit will likely be well short of the much bigger annual drop that the OBR predicted.
The latest business surveys for February also provide some good news, with firms looking ahead to better times. A rise from 41.2 in January to 49.8 this month in the IHS Markit/Cips purchasing managers index shows industry planning to rebuild stocks and begin growing again. A figure in the index above 50 indicates expansion. There were worrying signs from manufacturers, who said they were held back by delays to imports and exports at Britain’s ports. It was a clear message that without Brexit-related delays, the recovery could be so much stronger. Still, with more room for manoeuvre, Sunak could overcome many of the barriers to a recovery if he would only underwrite those businesses most in trouble for as long as the pandemic forces the government to impose restrictions. Confidence is the key to a recovery on the high street, as it is elsewhere in the economy. At the moment, Sunak is not going far enough to reassure those who are struggling that they will make it to the finish line."
2021-02-19T10:37:46Z,business,Business,Pound hits $1.40 for first time since 2018 amid Covid vaccine optimism,"The pound has hit $1.40 against the US dollar for the first time in almost three years, on expectations that the UK’s Covid-19 vaccination rollout will help the economy to rebound more quickly. Sterling hit $1.4005 during early trading on Friday morning, a rise of 0.2% on the day, touching a level not reached since April 2018.
The UK currency has been rising against the dollar and the euro in recent days, despite official figures confirming that the UK economy experienced its biggest annual contraction in 300 years in 2020. UK gross domestic product fell by 9.9% in 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics, as the pandemic affected every sector of the economy. Despite this, sterling is the best-performing currency among the G10 group of advanced economies this year, partly thanks to the speed of the UK’s vaccination programme.
More than 15 million people in the UK had been offered their first coronavirus vaccine by the middle of February, leading traders to bet that the economy would be able to reopen more quickly than in other European countries, where the vaccination rollout has been slower. The agreement of a Brexit deal with the EU, Britain’s largest trading partner, before Christmas has also provided some relief for the pound, despite evidence of some difficulties in the new trading regime. In addition, the US dollar has been under pressure in recent days after two weeks of disappointing jobs data in the US, giving the impression that the labour market is not improving as expected."
2021-02-19T08:30:58Z,business,Business,UK retail sales plunge as government borrows £8.8bn,"The impact of the UK’s third lockdown on the economy has been laid bare by official figures showing that spending in stores and online fell by more than 8% last month while government borrowing was the highest for a January since modern records began. All sectors of retailing except for food and online outlets were affected by the imposition of tough new restrictions across the UK, and although the Office for National Statistics said the decline was not as severe as the 22% drop in the first lockdown last April, it was substantially worse than the 3% drop the City had expected.
Rishi Sunak is planning to announce fresh support for retail and other hard-hit sectors of the economy in next month’s budget but the chancellor made it clear that action to repair the damage would eventually be required. “Since the start of the pandemic we have invested over £280bn to protect jobs, businesses and livelihoods across the UK - this is the fiscally responsible thing to do and the best way to support sustainable public finances in the medium-term,” Sunak said. “We have been able to respond comprehensively and generously through this crisis because of our strong public finances. Therefore, it is right that once our economy begins to recover, we should look to return the public finances to a more sustainable footing and I’ll always be honest with the British people about how we will do this.” The closure of non-essential stores hit two sectors – clothing and footwear, and household goods – particularly hard. Clothing sales were down 35% from December, while household goods registered a drop of almost 20%. A breakdown of the ONS data found that with the closure of stores on high streets and in shopping centres, consumers switched to buying online. Online spending accounted for a record 35.2% of sales last month, up from 29.6% in December 2020 and 19.5% in January 2020. After steadily recovering from the impact of the initial pandemic-induced lockdown during the course of 2020, retail sales in January were 5.5% lower than they were when the global crisis first hit the UK in February last year. Meanwhile, separate ONS figures for public borrowing – the difference between what the government spends and what it receives in taxes – stood at £8.8bn last month, the first deficit in 10 years. January is usually a strong month for the public finances because receipts from self-assessment returns arrive in the government’s coffers but the ONS said a small annual increase in tax receipts was outweighed by higher spending, up almost £20bn on a year earlier. The total included £5.1bn of expenditure on coronavirus job support schemes. In the first 10 months of the 2020-21 financial year, ONS figures show the government borrowed £270.6bn – up by £220bn on the same period of the previous year and comfortably the highest on record. With February and March usually heavy months for borrowing even during years when the economy is not subject to restrictions, analysts expect the final total for 2020-21 to be well in excess of £300bn, although not as high as the £370bn forecast by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility in November 2020.
Paul Dales, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said the drop in retail sales volumes in January was twice as big as the 4% fall during November’s lockdown. He added: “It would have been even worse if the government hadn’t used £8.8bn of borrowing to support the economy.” Jace Tyrrell, the chief executive of New West End Company, which represents 600 businesses on Oxford Street, Regent Street, Bond Street and in Mayfair, said retailers were waiting with bated breath for Monday’s announcement by the prime minister of the roadmap out of lockdown. “We require clarity and decisiveness to ensure that there are no further lockdowns, and assurance from the government that support will be made available to retailers in bridging the gap until sales can properly resume,” he added."
2021-02-18T22:57:50Z,business,Business,Robinhood CEO and others in trading saga testify before Congress at GameStop hearing – as it happened,"With that, we close the six-hour hearing on the legal and financial ramifications of the massive buy-up of stocks that threatened to upend the US financial system. Main issues brought up today include the gamification and ease of access for trading brought by Robinhood’s app, and the mental health and financial implications of that. Repeatedly the suicide was mentioned of one Robinhood user who believed he had racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. Lawmakers say Robinhood needs better protections and customer service for users who need support. Many lawmakers also mentioned payment for order flow, a controversial practice pioneered by Bernie Madoff. Through the practice, stockbrokers get a kickback for essentially selling the ability to execute trades. Tenev said in the hearing that around 50% of Robinhood profit comes from payment for order flow. Some legislators questioned whether it should be allowed, while others, in particular Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, suggested such gains should be passed on to customers rather than pocketed by Robinhood and its rich cohorts like hedge fund managers. Still others suggested taxing these transactions in general. Rashida Tlaib said a 0.1% tax on financial transactions would discourage high risk trading while raising more than $800bn for taxpayers in the next ten years alone. Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the committee which assembled the hearing, said there will be at least two hearings investigating the GameStop incident."
2021-02-18T22:40:57Z,business,Business,GameStop hearing: Robinhood founder defends halt to trading,"The chief executive of the Robinhood app has defended the decision to halt trading in GameStop shares at a congressional hearing on Thursday, calling allegations that the company acted to help hedge funds that were hemorrhaging money “absolutely false”. The comments triggered accusations the company was creating a “smokescreen” to deflect blame.
Vlad Tenev and other players in January’s GameStop saga appeared before the House financial services committee in the first public hearing in a wide-ranging investigation into trading in GameStop, AMC and other companies whose share values soared as small investors piled into the stocks. “The buying surge that occurred during the last week of January in stocks like GameStop was unprecedented, and it highlighted a number of issues that are worthy of deep analysis and discussion,” Tenev said. Shares in the Texas computer game retailer surged 1,600% in January as small investors worldwide – many coalescing on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets – piled into the troubled retailer’s shares betting against Wall Street hedge funds that had bet the share price would collapse – a practice known as short-selling. At one point, short-sellers had borrowed far more of GameStop’s shares (140%) to sell short than were available on the market. Tenev once again apologized for the trading ban. “Despite the unprecedented market conditions in January, at the end of the day, what happened is unacceptable to us,” Tenev said.
The sometimes fractious hearing was largely divided along party lines, with Democrats calling for more oversight and Republicans arguing against more regulation. “Don’t you see something has gone terribly wrong here?” said the Democratic congressman David Scott. He called social media-led stock market bubbles “a threat to the future of our financial system”. Republican Bill Huizenga called the hearing “political theater”.
According to Tenev, Robinhood and other brokers had no choice but to suspend trading in GameStop and other hot investments during this period of “historic volatility”. Robinhood is required to place a deposit using its own funds at a clearinghouse to cover risks until trades are settled between a buyer and seller. On 28 January, the company was informed by its clearing house, NSCC, that it had a deposit deficit of approximately $3bn – up from $124m just days before. With trading in hot stocks suspended, Robinhood moved to raise $3.4bn from investors and trading was resumed. But the suspension triggered a firestorm of criticism among small investors and in Washington, with Republicans and Democrats attacking Robinhood and accusing it of backing the losing hedge funds over small investors. Christopher Iacovella, the chief executive of the brokerage-industry group American Securities Association, dismissed Tenev’s explanation and said the system had worked as it should to defend the US’s financial system. “As the GME [GameStop] short squeeze unfolded, the clearinghouse recognized that an inadequately capitalized broker-dealer could pose a risk to our markets,” Iacovella said in a letter to the House committee. “Attempts to blame the clearinghouse or the timing of the settlement cycle for what happened during the short squeeze are a smokescreen.” Thursday’s hearing, titled Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide, is the first of a series and addressed a number of issues including the “gamification” of investing, the role of social media and potential conflicts of interest. Tenev was also asked about the suicide of Alex Kearns, a 20-year-old trader who mistakenly believed he had lost $730,000 on a trade. Tenev called the death “deeply troubling” and said Robinhood had taken “very aggressive steps to make our products safer for our customers”. Later in the hearing, Representative Sean Casten of Illinois called Robinhood’s hotline and played its automated message. “This was a man who was 20 years old. He was not allowed to buy a beer but he was allowed to take on $730,000 in debt,” said Casten. The representatives questioned the role of Citadel, an investment firm that executes Robinhood clients’ trades and also invested in Melvin Capital Management after the hedge fund’s bets against GameStop collapsed. Both Citadel’s founder, Ken Griffin, and Melvin’s founder, Gabe Plotkin, testified at the hearing. In his testimony, Plotkin denied that Citadel “bailed out” Melvin. Plotkin said January’s frenzied trading in GameStop was “untethered to fundamentals” and quoted racist messages aimed at him and others, including antisemitic statements such as “it’s very clear we need a second Holocaust, the Jews can’t keep getting away with this.” GameStop’s share price has now collapsed from a high of $483 on 28 January to just over $44. But one of the small investors who helped drive the stock to dizzy heights is still a believer. In his testimony Keith Gill, a trader variously known online as Roaring Kitty and DeepFuckingValue, said his investments made him a millionaire. “GameStop’s stock price may have gotten a bit ahead of itself last month, but I’m as bullish as I’ve ever been on a potential turnaround. In short, I like the stock,” he said."
2021-02-18T21:24:51Z,business,Business,Philip Green's Arcadia had £510m pension deficit when it collapsed ,"Philip Green’s Arcadia Group had a pension deficit of £510m – about £150m more than expected – when the fashion retailer collapsed in November, according to documents seen by the Guardian. In all, Arcadia Group Ltd, the parent company of Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Miss Selfridge, owed creditors £800m when it called in administrators, according to a statement of the group’s financial affairs prepared by Arcadia’s board and sent to creditors this week. The business collapsed after Arcadia went into a tailspin during the pandemic, following years of poor trading and high costs. Trade creditors, including fashion and shop fitting suppliers, were owed £163m and landlords £36.5m, while tax authorities lost out on £44.2m, according to the document, which provides the best estimate of Arcadia’s debts so far. The final number could be higher – or lower – because the group is made up of several smaller companies and not all their debts flow up to the parent group.
The statement confirms that creditors are likely to receive only a small portion of the money owed. The Green family’s Aldsworth Equity, however, is set to receive a £50m payout. The money is owed on an interest-free loan Aldsworth made to the group in 2019 at the time of an emergency restructure. By contrast, more than 1,000 suppliers to the high street fashion chain are set to get less than 1% of the money owed to them The worst-case scenario calculations put the combined deficit in Arcadia’s three pension schemes at £150m more than previously estimated. This is despite £100m paid into the schemes by the Green family over the past two years. Trustees of the pension scheme said that they had since received £180m of funds from the sale of Arcadia assets – up from slightly on last week – as part of £210m in secured funds agreed under a 2019 deal between the pensions regulator and the Green family. Those proceeds mean the scheme is on course to remain independent of the industry-backed pensions lifeboat, which caps future payouts to savers. The Arcadia trustees believe that despite the £510m deficit, they will have sufficient funds to pay more than the lifeboat can offer. The news comes as administrators begin consultation on the closure of three Arcadia distribution centres, with the potential loss of more than 1,000 jobs. The closures include the historic Burton site in Leeds, where 400 jobs are at risk. The site has been in operation since 1922, starting out as a factory before becoming a distribution centre for Arcadia stores including Dorothy Perkins and Burton. In its heyday the Burton factory, which opened in 1921, employed 10,000 people and produced 30,000 suits a week. Jake O’Malley, an organiser for the GMB union, which represents workers at the site, said: “A century of history and hundreds of good jobs down the pan – while Philip Green is living it up on his private yacht and the administrators pick the bones of the business clean. “GMB will fight tooth and nail to make sure workers get what they deserve from this mess.”"
2021-02-18T19:46:27Z,business,Business,Next chief calls for business rates overhaul to rescue high street,"The chief executive of Next has warned an online tax is not the answer to the high street crisis, and that business rates should be slashed on shops and hiked on online retail warehouses. Rates, the commercial equivalent of council tax, on shops should fall by 35% while the bills for online fulfilment centres should be increased by 50%, said Simon Wolfson, who runs one of the UK’s most successful retail businesses. The challenge of operating through a pandemic meant many retailers were on the verge of administration, Wolfson said, and if those businesses were to be rescued, rates would be key to the new owner’s decision on whether to keep the shops. The recent break up of Sir Philip Green’s fashion empire, Arcadia, saw its famous brands, including Topshop, bought by online groups who rejected its 500 stores, leading to heavy job losses. “It would be a shame for a huge number of shops to shut unnecessarily because rates are too high,” said Wolfson in an interview with the BBC. The businessman also came out against a mooted online sales tax because “ultimately the consumer will pay the price of that … you cannot tax people back on to the high street”.
Tesco – which is one of the biggest payers of the property-based tax – is calling for a 1% online sales tax to be imposed, alongside business rates reform. Wolfson suggested there was a better way. There are some internet companies who “frankly don’t want to make a profit they just want to turn over as much as they can until all of their competition go out of business and then raise their margins later”, he said. “So there is an argument for an online sales tax to stop people avoiding corporation tax. But a better way of doing that is to say if you’re an online business, pay either 2% of your turnover or 19% of your profits, whichever is the higher. “That would forensically attack those people off-shoring profits while not damaging the nascent internet business which, frankly for us traditional retailers, is one of the few things actually keeping us afloat.” The government launched a fundamental review of the property tax last year. A Treasury spokesman said: “We want to see thriving high streets, which is why we have spent tens of billions of pounds supporting shops throughout the pandemic and are supporting town centres through the changes online shopping brings.” The review called for evidence on whether to “shift the balance” between online and physical shops by introducing an online sales tax, the spokesman said. “We’re considering responses now.”"
2021-02-18T18:03:16Z,business,Business,MPs urge FCA to hand over Woodford inquiry to independent judge or QC,"Pressure is mounting on the City watchdog over its stalled investigation into the collapse of Neil Woodford’s investment business, after MPs called for the government to step in and order a judicial review unless the Financial Conduct Authority hands over its inquiry to an independent judge or QC. Mel Stride MP, the chair of the Commons Treasury select committee, said on Thursday that the FCA needed to set out when the investigation would conclude. The regulator began its inquiry in June 2019, the same month Woodford’s flagship fund was suspended. But it has yet to publish any findings, with the FCA blaming the pandemic for its difficulties in accessing documents and witnesses. Woodford revealed last weekend he planned to return to investment management, prompting outrage from investors and concern from regulators. Campaigners say the one-time star investment manager’s previous venture left more than 300,000 small investors nursing losses initially estimated at about £1bn. “As the FCA’s investigation still continues over 18 months after the fund was suspended, the reports of the new fund may understandably be of concern to investors who previously lost out,” Stride said. “The FCA should set out when we can expect its investigation to conclude.” The FCA has responded by saying Woodford still faced the outcome of a regulatory investigation and would need authorisation before returning to investment management. There is growing unhappiness in some quarters about how long the FCA’s investigation is taking and whether its remit may be too limited. On Thursday, the fund manager and activist Gina Miller called for the regulator to cede control and appoint an external investigator. “The only choice for the new head of the FCA is to hand wherever they have got to in their investigation to an independent judge or QC, and widen the scope to include the FCA,” Miller told the Guardian. She claimed the “rushed-out statement” from the FCA “appears to indicate they are turning a blind eye to their own regulatory actions, or lack thereof, in Woodford. Even if this were to be included, which I doubt, they shouldn’t be allowed to investigate themselves. Miller – who is best-known for mounting a legal challenge over Brexit, but has also campaigned on consumer protection standards through her True and Fair campaign – indicated that the investigation should take a similar form to the inquiry carried out by the former high court judge Dame Elizabeth Gloster into the regulation of the scandal-hit investment firm London Capital & Finance. If the FCA did not hand over the investigation and widen its remit, Miller said the Treasury should step in and request a judicial review, adding that those who had lost money in the Woodford debacle should not have to club together to take legal action.
She also said it was important that any independent judge or QC looked at “all links in the chain” – including distributor firms and investment platforms such as Hargreaves Lansdown and St James’s Place. Earlier this week Miller and her husband and business partner, Alan Miller, wrote to the Commons Treasury committee about the issue, saying: “We believe it ought to be a very serious source of public policy concern that high-profile individuals such as Mr Woodford can be allowed to recommence trading, with the slate ostensibly wiped clean, when over 300,000 people … are scrabbling to make ends meet after seeing their life savings decimated.” The fund manager Terry Smith – in charge of the £22.6bn Fundsmith Equity fund – also weighed in, telling the trade publication Interactive Investor: “I’m a believer in human redemption ... But to attain redemption, one of the very first things you have to do is be afflicted with painful personal knowledge of what went wrong, and very publicly tell people that you have reached that conclusion and that you are sorry, and what you would change about it.” In its statement issued just before 9pm on Tuesday, the FCA said “any comment about the scope of this ongoing investigation is purely speculation; we have not confirmed who or what we are investigating”."

2021-02-18T14:31:39Z,business,Business,"Airbus reports loss of €1bn after Covid, and could shed 15,000 jobs","Airbus plummeted to a loss of more than €1bn last year and will continue to withhold shareholder payouts after deliveries of its aircraft fell by a third. The European aerospace giant warned aircraft would remain under pressure in the year ahead amid a “volatile environment” created by the coronavirus pandemic.
Airbus delivered 566 commercial aircraft in 2020, down sharply from 863 the year before, and expects to deliver the same number in 2021. The company warned last summer that it would face the “gravest crisis” in its history due to the pandemic, and planned to cut as many as 15,000 jobs, including 1,700 in the UK.
The slowdown in aircraft deliveries caused revenues at Airbus to fall by 27% to €49.9bn (£42.4bn) last year, leading to a net loss of €1.13bn for 2020. The gloomy financial result follows a €1.36bn loss in 2019 after the company was forced to pay a record £3bn in penalties for paying bribes on an “endemic” basis to land contracts in 20 countries. Announcing Airbus’s annual results on Thursday, Guillaume Faury, the chief executive, said many uncertainties remained for the industry as “the pandemic continues to impact lives, economies and societies”. He said he hoped the company’s guidance would “provide some visibility in a volatile environment”. But Peter McNally, an industry expert at research firm Third Bridge, said the outlook for 2021 could “prove disappointing to some investors”. “Commercial airlines are off to a difficult start in 2021 and the outlook from Airbus reflects that,” he said. “The situation could improve as vaccines are more widely distributed, but Airbus executives note most of their customer base will be burning cash most of this year.” Shares in Airbus fell 2.8% to €91.29 on Thursday. The coronavirus has wreaked havoc on the travel and aircraft industries following severe restrictions to limit its spread.
“The bright side is that leisure travel has been the area that has started its recovery first, and the Airbus order book is geared for that eventual uptick with their A320 fleet,” McNally said. According to aerospace and defence lobby group ADS more than a 10th of the jobs in the UK’s aerospace industry could be cut as the plane manufacturers Airbus and Boeing and their suppliers adjust to lower demand. A large number of those job losses will come from Airbus and the engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, which are both making thousands of redundancies. The difficult year for the aerospace sector is also expected to hit smaller supply chain workers."
2021-02-18T13:43:38Z,business,Business,'Deafening silence': UK government blasted over delays to employment reforms,"The government has been accused of dragging its heels on promised reforms to zero-hours contracts and the gig economy as legislation to protect workers faces serious delays. New legislation intended to bolster protections for Britain’s most vulnerable workers will not be ready until the end of the year at the earliest, raising fresh questions about the government’s promise to protect workers’ rights after Brexit. Whitehall’s newly departed employment tsar, Matthew Taylor, said there was a “deafening silence” from ministers on the landmark employment reforms, in areas such as zero-hour contracts and the gig economy, which were announced by Boris Johnson more than a year ago. The government pledged to make Britain “the best place in the world to work”. Taylor claims the government’s enthusiasm for the reforms had since “waned”. While the business department said the government remained fully committed to toughening up the law to protect those in precarious employment, the TUC, the Labour party and senior Conservatives joined Taylor in demanding faster progress. Sources close to the government said its flagship employment bill – pledged before the UK formally left the EU as the central mechanism to safeguard workers’ rights – was unlikely to be launched until late 2021 or even early 2022. Stakeholders have been told these are the potential times it could be brought to parliament, despite being announced more than a year ago, they said. The changes to tackle insecure work had been promised in the December 2019 Queen’s speech, a day before the key Commons vote that passed Johnson’s Brexit plan, as the way his government would “protect and enhance workers’ rights as the UK leaves the EU, making Britain the best place in the world to work”. But in an intervention over the lack of progress,Taylor, who was the government’s director of labour market enforcement until the end of last month, questioned the Conservative party’s desire to safeguard working standards. “There is still no clarity on what the government intends to do. We have seen a gradual but unmistakable deceleration of the government reform agenda in relation to good work. There was an initial enthusiasm but that has waned, and waned, and waned,” he told the Guardian. Taylor’s role as director of employment rights remains vacant after his term expired last month. He offered to remain in post unpaid until ministers hired a replacement but was turned down. A business department spokesman said launching the bill was a matter of securing parliamentary time, adding that “protecting and enhancing workers’ rights is an absolute priority for this government. “We remain firmly committed to upholding high standards and to delivering legislation that ensures we have an employment framework that is fit for purpose in the 21st century.” However, MPs, including backbench Tories, have grown unsettled by the lack of progress. The Commons women and equalities committee said last week the bill was vital for protecting female workers disproportionately hit by the pandemic. Caroline Nokes, the group’s Conservative chair, said: “We think it’s important the bill comes forward before the end of June.” Taylor, a former adviser to Tony Blair who led a government review of modern working practices for Theresa May in 2017, said it was surprising ministers appeared to be dithering at a time when public concern over abuses in the workplace was rising due to the Covid recession. More than 2.6 million people are forecast to be unemployed by the middle of this year – more than double pre-pandemic levels. Sources said officials cast around last summer for a refit of the bill to reflect the impact of Covid on the jobs market, but there had been little progress since towards launching it.
In a sign of its unready state, they said key consultations for reforms in the bill – such as a new single enforcement body for employment rights – had yet to be responded to by the government. While the urgency of tackling Covid had delayed other areas of policy, Taylor said more could have been done and suggested the Tories were increasingly split on how to proceed. “I suspect they are caught in the horns of a dilemma, in that they have deregulatory instincts you would expect of a Conservative government. And you have a business community very unhappy about Brexit, so they don’t want to be seen to be doing anything that might look like they are putting further burdens on business,” he said. “We are seeing a government that doesn’t want to abandon its commitment to good work, but also doesn’t want to upset the deregulatory wing of its own party and parts of British business.” Andy McDonald, the shadow employment rights secretary, said the bill needed bringing forward. “Weak employment rights and almost non-existent enforcement has contributed to unsafe working and economic insecurity that has left the UK with the highest Covid death rate in the world and the worst economic crisis of any major economy,” he said. Tim Sharp, senior policy officer for employment rights at the TUC, said: “It’s really disappointing we haven’t seen it yet. It seems to give a sense of where workplace rights issues sit in the set of priorities.” Last month it emerged the government was reviewing options to change workers’ rights after Brexit amid concerns over border disruption for companies and a push by ministers to demonstrate benefits from leaving the EU. However, the new business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, then stage a rapid U-turn late last month, saying the work was “no longer happening within the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy”. He added: “I made it very very clear to officials in the department that we’re not interested in watering down workers’ rights.” Opposition voices are, however, concerned that a review being led by the former Tory leader Ian Duncan Smith into post-Brexit opportunities could be used to recommend watering down employment standards, in a process that is due to report back to the prime minister in April. Charities said rising unemployment caused by the Covid crisis raised the risk of unscrupulous employers abusing the law. Past recessions have also contributed to growth in low-paid and precarious work that has trapped workers in poverty. Dave Innes, the head of economics at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said ministers delivering on the Queen’s speech promised the government could build a more secure future for workers hit hardest by the Covid recession. “Only a recovery with a strong focus on good jobs, as opposed to any jobs, will help families who have been pulled into poverty during this crisis, as well as addressing the existing flaws in the labour market which have kept people trapped,” he said."
2021-02-18T12:00:33Z,business,Business,My client is a lifelong Republican – and he supports a minimum-wage rise | Gene Marks,"A longtime client of mine, a lifelong Republican, an ardent supporter of Donald Trump, said something very unusual to me the other day. He said: “I support a national $15-an-hour minimum wage.”
This comment kind of seemed out of character. My client runs a 100-person manufacturing firm. He is very conservative in his opinions. He hates “big government”. He opposes the regulations and spending supported by Democrats. He’s a good person, a smart business owner and a fair employer. He strongly feels he should be in charge of his employee’s wages, not “some bureaucrat in Washington”. He would not seem to be the kind of person that you would think supports a higher federal minimum wage. So why does he? Is this some form of latent altruism? Is it because he wants more pay equality and better income distribution? No, those are not the main reasons. For him, a business owner, it’s all about competitiveness. A $15 per hour federal minimum wage would “simply level the playing field”, he says. My client’s business depends on hourly workers. It is located in New Jersey, where the state minimum wage is already $10 per hour ($2.75 higher than the national level) and slated to go up to $15 within the next three years. Like the business owners there – and other states bracing for similar increases – he’s struggling to adjust his cost structure. He has to do this because he’s at a serious competitive disadvantage. That’s because most of my client’s competitors aren’t located in New Jersey. They’re located in Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky and Louisiana. Or Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. These are all the states where the minimum wage is equal to the federal $7.25-an-hour level. Because those companies aren’t required to pay a higher minimum wage, their cost structures are lower. Therefore, they can charge less. My client has no choice but to charge higher prices for his products in order to make a profit. This is an enormous challenge. When people argue about the minimum wage they focus on unemployment. Some studies have found that an increased minimum wage has no impact on unemployment. Others have found the opposite. Economists have been looking at this issue for years. But unfortunately no one really and truly knows the answer as to whether or not such a legislation would help or hurt workers – or the companies who employ them.
But what has been missed in all of these analysis is parity. We live in an enormous country with hundreds of millions of people. Up until now, the minimum wage issue has been delegated to the states. Which means that there’s been a growing disparity among wages paid. Companies located in Texas can pay their workers less and, thanks to those relative lower wages, the cost of living in those areas is also less. Thanks to Covid, cloud technology, changing workplaces and a newfound appreciation among many for a better work life balance, more companies and startups are tempted to gravitate to such places. Unfortunately, this is a big problem for all those companies in all those states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois. Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Virginia and Washington DC.) that have passed legislation to increase their minimum wage to $15 an hour. According to the US Census Bureau, these states are home to 3.2m companies with employees, or approximately 41% of all the small businesses with employees in the country. Is it fair that they must pay more for their employees when their American competitors in other states pay so much less? Do you blame these companies for outsourcing work to lower-cost countries just to stay in the game? So maybe, just maybe, to fix that disadvantage, an increase in the federal minimum wage would actually be a good thing for those business owners. It will level the playing field. It will boost competitiveness. It will keep a lot of work in the United States and not overseas. “Please,” my right-leaning client says. “Increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. It will be a boost to my business.”"
2021-02-18T09:44:18Z,business,Business,Travel insurance slump cuts profits at Moneysupermarket,"Price comparison website Moneysupermarket has reported a sharp slump in annual profits after coronavirus restrictions wiped out demand for travel insurance. The financial services platform, which helps customers compare deals, reported a 24% fall in pre-tax profits, to £87.8m, following “negligible” revenues from its TravelSupermarket site. The pandemic also limited the appetite for deals on home, car and life insurance, and the demand for new credit products, hampered also by tighter lending criteria. In Moneysupermarket’s home services, such as energy tariffs, there have been fewer people using the site to switch because many of the deals offering the biggest savings have been removed from the market as energy companies raise bills. Peter Duffy, the chief executive of Moneysupermarket Group, which also includes MoneySavingExpert.com, said the company has continued to help “millions of UK households save on their bills” and provide “indispensable financial advice throughout the Covid-19 pandemic”.
“The business is resilient, and our dividend reflects our confidence for the future,” he said. “Our job now is to encourage consumers to engage with us more and save on more of their bills. We will use our data better so consumers find our sites easier to use and are reminded when there are savings available to them.” The company, once known for its controversial advertising campaigns, warned that its outlook for the year ahead would depend on how soon travel restrictions are lifted. Its adjusted earnings tumbled by 24% to £107.8m last year, and may fall further to £96.4m in 2021 if restrictions are maintained. The company will require a “strong and rapid recovery” in demand for travel insurance and borrowing if it hopes to reach £128.8m, which is the top end of its guidance for the year ahead."
2021-02-18T09:08:57Z,business,Business,Happy Valentine's puts Moonpig on track to double annual sales,"Moonpig recorded the strongest week of sales in its history in the run-up to Valentine’s Day as it benefited from online spending during the latest lockdown. The company, which floated on the stock market this month, said it was on track to double its annual revenues as Covid restrictions drive greater demand. Revenues last year were £173m. Consumers have flocked to the site to buy cards, and many are also choosing gifts, which has raised the average amount spent on each Moonpig order. Moonpig’s shares jumped 17% on its stock market debut on 2 February, valuing the company at £1.4bn by the end of its first day as a listed company. The company placed 140m shares at an initial price of 350p, to give new investors a 41% stake in the company and raise £20m to fund its expansion. The trend towards online card and gift purchases has come at the expense of established high street names including Paperchase, which has shut 27 stores and cut 270 jobs as part of a rescue deal with the private equity fund Permira. However, in its trading update on Thursday Moonpig warned investors that it expected the frequency of customer orders, and the number with attached gifts, to “moderate” when lockdown restrictions begin to ease and shoppers are allowed back on to the high street. The company added that its soaring revenues would be tempered by higher costs from extra staffing and Covid-19 measures."
2021-02-18T08:24:33Z,business,Business,Barclays boosts bonus payouts despite 30% fall in profit,"Barclays has paid its chief executive, Jes Staley, £4m and handed larger bonuses to its bankers despite a 30% drop in annual profits during the Covid crisis. Pre-tax profits fell to £3.1bn for 2020 from £4.4bn a year earlier, with earnings hit by a jump in bad debt provisions. The bank put aside a total of £4.8bn to cover a potential surge in loan defaults linked to the coronavirus outbreak, slightly lower than the £5bn that analysts had expected. However, the bank highlighted the strong performance of its investment bank, which benefited from a jump in trading due to market volatility last year, and corporate fundraising. The division reported a 35% jump in pre-tax profits to £4bn for the whole of 2020, helping cushion the blow of the bad debt provision. The bank, which also published its annual report on Thursday, revealed it had paid Staley £4m for 2020, including an annual bonus worth £843,000. Staley donated £392,000 of his income last year to the bank’s coronavirus fund, but did not waive his bonus like rivals at NatWest and Lloyds, leaving him with £3.6m. That is down from £5.9m in 2019, when Staley was paid a £1.7m bonus. Staley said he had not decided whether he would donate more of his pay, given the ongoing Covid crisis, adding that the bank’s senior leadership had made “a really significant contribution of our compensation last year”. “Let’s see what this year brings,” he added. The overall bonus pool for Barclays’ bankers rose by 6% for 2020 to £1.6bn. The Bank of England warned in December that it would keep a close eye on cash bonuses for senior staff, given the uncertain economic outlook.
Staley cheered the performance of the investment bank, which he said was capitalising on the long-term growth in fundraising by companies through both the stock and bond markets. “There’s an underlying momentum in the capital markets that, I think, won’t recede,” he said. While the lender warned of further headwinds in 2021, including low interest rates and subdued demand for consumer borrowing, Barclays is banking on a rebound in consumer spending as vaccines are rolled out and Covid restrictions are eased. Higher spending would help to increase income through higher credit card spending as well as interchange and merchant fees. A lifting of restrictions would also likely reduce the number of payment holidays and overdraft fee waivers offered by the bank during the pandemic. Barclays also announced it was restarting dividend payments, with plans to pay shareholders 1p per share for 2020 and launch a £700m share buyback programme. It is the first bank to do so, after the Bank of England lifted its temporary ban on shareholder distributions in December to allow limited payouts. The regulator ordered UK lenders to scrap nearly £8bn in combined shareholder payouts at the start of the Covid crisis last March, to give banks a larger financial cushion to weather the economic downturn. Barclays shares fell 4.4%, making the bank one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 on Thursday. “This suggests that [share] buybacks are not necessarily going to be seen as the show of confidence that management is hoping to offer,” Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said. Staley said he was keen to to get workers back into offices after Covid, backtracking from statements made last April when he declared the days of putting 7,000 people into a single building “may be a thing of the past”. While the banking boss was initially surprised at how its 85,000 global staff were able to keep the bank running from their kitchen tables, Staley said “it’s getting old”. “I look forward to us being able to welcome colleagues back into the office. That will certainly happen sometime this year.” The bank is still reviewing its real estate footprint, but is committed to keeping a “significant presence” in London’s Canary Wharf, where both its headquarters and investment bank are based, Staley said. But as more customers shift to online banking, the future of Barclays’ branch network is not as secure. Staley said: “I think you’ll see our number of branches decline but it will be where there’s an absolute economic rationale for it.” Barclays closed about 100 locations last year, leaving it with a network of 859 branches."
2021-02-18T00:01:19Z,business,Business,UK garment factory workers at higher risk of dying with Covid – study,"Sewing machinists and others with jobs in garment factories have among the highest rate of coronavirus deaths among working women in the UK, according to an analysis by the Office for National Statistics. Twenty-one Covid-19 deaths among women aged between 20 and 64 in the “assemblers and routine operatives” category were registered between 9 March and 28 December 2020, giving the group a death rate of 39 per 100,000 women. The analysis, published in January and now highlighted by the campaign group Labour Behind the Label (LBL), found that sewing machinists as a subgroup had the highest fatality rate among women of any group, at about 65 deaths per 100,000 – although with 14 deaths recorded, the ONS cautions that the small size of the underlying group makes that calculation less reliable, and the rate may be as low as 35 or as high as 110 per 100,000. The central estimate for sewing machinists is almost four times the overall rate of deaths among women in the UK, of about 17 per 100,000. LBL called the figures “a stark reminder of working conditions in Britain’s garment industry” and said they underlined the need for tougher government regulation to hold retailers responsible for poor conditions in their supply chains. Last summer it was revealed that garment factories in Leicester, many of them supplying the fast fashion brand Boohoo, had stayed open throughout the first lockdown, with staff complaining that they were forced to continue working without adequate safety measures in place. They described working at close proximity without barriers, a lack of hand sanitiser, and unhygienic toilets. In some cases factories sought to avoid scrutiny by running night shifts with the shutters down. One man interviewed by the BBC last summer said his aunt, a factory worker, had died with coronavirus after she had returned to work because she needed the money. “The garment factories around here are the worst. They put the shutters down and then brought people in round the side. Not all of them, but a lot of them,” he told the broadcaster. “In some of them it’s not possible to socially distance and people do not even wash their hands. The fact my aunt died after going back to work has broken me.” With many Boohoo suppliers in the city unable to prove they were paying the minimum wage, the company has since promised a major reform programme in its supply chain and is telling its suppliers to stop subcontracting work to smaller factories. While many factories in Leicester have made changes to their working practices since the first lockdown, sources in the city said some were continuing to force machinists to work in close proximity without adequate safety measures in place. Dominique Muller, from LBL, said workers were facing “a perfect storm of exploitative and dangerous working conditions. Brands, unions and government agencies must now work together to create a binding set of obligations to protect those most vulnerable.” Lee Barron, the Midlands regional secretary for the TUC, said the risks highlighted by the data were evidence that the law should be changed. He said: “The government must use its much-delayed employment bill to make firms liable for abuses in their supply chains.”"
2021-02-18T00:01:19Z,business,Business,Covid optimism lifts business confidence in UK to five-year high,"Business confidence has jumped to its highest level in five years as firms look ahead to Covid-19 lockdown restrictions easing and a bounce in sales during 2021, according to a leading barometer of corporate activity. Companies are also preparing to increase exports and employment in the second half of the year in a clear signal that they expect a strengthening economic outlook after a successful vaccination programme. The business confidence index, compiled by the ICAEW accountancy body from a survey of 1,000 firms, showed confidence for the year ahead rising from -19 in the fourth quarter of 2020 to +10 in the first quarter of 2021. However, the rebound will be against a weaker economic backdrop than last year after a big hit to sales in the first three months of 2021, mostly the result of the third lockdown, forcing even more firms to reduce output and jobs. Last week the British Retail Consortium and Barclaycard said spending in January was at its weakest since May, as booming online activity failed to compensate fully for the closure of stores. Michael Izza, the ICAEW’s chief executive, said businesses reported the fastest drop in employment for a decade as they struggled to cope with falling sales. More than half of firms were operating at less than capacity. The bounce-back in confidence was also much weaker so far than in 2009 when the index, which began in 2003, climbed to 25.8 in the aftermath of the banking crash. Official figures last week showed that the UK suffered the worst annual fall in GDP for 300 years in 2020. The 9.9% drop was mostly felt in the spring and summer before a modest recovery of 1% in the final quarter of the year. Izza said 2020 was “an unparalleled struggle for business”, but the mass rollout of a vaccine and a Brexit trade deal had provided the foundations for a recovery in 2021. “Rising confidence among businesses is an encouraging sign of things to come and a predicted growth in employment is good news for people who have lost their jobs over the past year,” he said.
“As we look towards spring and summer, we want to see the chancellor use the upcoming budget to provide a bridge to sustainable and resilient economic recovery, getting people back to work, helping exporters, and investing in digital technology to make our businesses competitive in the 21st century economy.” The ICAEW barometer is based on a survey that asks respondents to rank their level of confidence between +100 to show much more confidence and -100 to show much less. A score of zero indicates that the outlook is the same as the previous quarter."
2021-02-17T22:02:08Z,business,Business,"GameStop: US lawmakers to quiz key players from Robinhood, Reddit and finance","Frenzied trading in the shares of GameStop and other companies will be the subject of what is expected to be a fiery hearing in Congress on Thursday, when US politicians get their first chance to quiz executives from the trading app Robinhood, Reddit and other players in the saga. The House financial services committee will hold a hearing at noon in a first step to untangling the furore surrounding trading in GameStop, AMC cinemas and other companies whose share values soared to astronomical levels as small investors piled into the stocks. The hearing, titled Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide, is expected to be fractious. Shares in GameStop, a troubled video games chain store, soared 1,600% in January, as an army of small investors, many using the trading app Robinhood, appeared to have bet that Wall Street hedge funds had overplayed their hand when betting the stock price would collapse â€“ a practice known as short-selling.
Spurred on by meme-toting members of the Reddit forum WallStreetBets, investors kept buying the shares, driving up the price and triggering huge losses for some hedge funds. Robinhood briefly suspended trading in GameStop and other hot stocks at the end of January and sparked allegations that the hedge funds and others may have pushed Robinhood and other trading platforms to stop the rout. The news managed to â€“ briefly â€“ unite Washingtonâ€™s deeply divided political elite. Both the rightwing senator Ted Cruz and the progressive representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez attacked Robinhoodâ€™s decision to halt trading in GameStop by small investors.
Ocasio-Cortez sits on the bipartisan financial services committee. Among those testifying are: Robinhoodâ€™s CEO, Vlad Tenev. Redditâ€™s CEO, Steve Huffman. Gabe Plotkin, founder of the Melvin Capital Management hedge fund, which was forced into a rescue after retail traders crushed its bets against GameStop. Ken Griffin, billionaire CEO of Citadel, an investment firm that executes Robinhood clientsâ€™ trades and also helped to bail out Melvin. Keith Gill, a trader variously known online as Roaring Kitty and DeepFuckingValue and a longtime GameStop booster. The hearing marks the first time the major players in the GameStop controversy have all been forced to publicly reckon with the anger the episode provoked among small investors and across the political spectrum. Gregg Gelzinis, associate director for economic policy at the Center for American Progress, said: â€œThe GameStop drama raised quite a few public policy questions but first itâ€™s important for members of Congress to understand how events played out.â€� Gelzinis said there were still questions about the timeline of events. More broadly, he said, GameStop had highlighted many crucial issues for regulators, including the role and regulation of hedge funds, whether or how Wall Street is using social media to drive investment strategy, the â€œgamificationâ€� of investing by trading apps and the economic incentives at play for the trading platforms. â€œWhat would have happened if Robinhood had failed? What would have been the knock-on effects for financial markets?â€� he asked. â€œThese are huge investor protection questions. â€œI saw someone on Twitter describe it as a Rorschach test for financial regulators,â€� he added. The hearing will not be the last inquiry that the executives at the center of the controversy will face. Federal prosecutors have begun an investigation, according to the Wall Street Journal, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the USâ€™s top financial watchdog, is reportedly combing through social media posts for signs of potential fraud. In the meantime, evidence has emerged that small investors were not the largest buyers of GameStop and other hot companies. According to an analysis by JP Morgan, institutional investors may have been behind much of the dramatic rise in the share price. â€œAlthough retail buying was portrayed as the main driver of the extreme price rally experienced by some stocks, the actual picture may be much more nuanced,â€� Peng Cheng, a JP Morgan analyst, told clients in a note. Gelzinis said Thursdayâ€™s hearing was likely to raise as many new questions as it answered but was a necessary first step to understanding the seismic changes in investing that GameStop highlighted. â€œThis is only the start of the story,â€� he said. â€œItâ€™s clear this is not just a clearcut small investor versus Wall Street story. Itâ€™s a fairly messy picture but hopefully by the end we can paint a clearer picture and draw up some public policy conclusions from it.â€�"
2021-02-17T19:38:29Z,business,Business,Mining boom could herald commodity 'supercycle',"It is known as a “supercycle” – and there have only been four in the past century. The term defines periods when commodity prices enjoy an extended boom, and this week’s multibillion-dollar windfalls for mining company investors suggest a fifth supercycle is on its way. Indeed, there are signs it may have already begun. In recent weeks the price of iron ore, which is used to make steel, surged by more than 85% to reach highs not seen in almost 10 years.
The market price for copper, used in electrical wiring, has followed suit by climbing 80% since last March to reach a nine-year high. Meanwhile, nickel is trading close to 17-month highs and cobalt is at close to two-year peaks. Mark Lewis, the chief sustainability strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management, told the Guardian last month: “It feels like any market you look at, investors want to buy.”
The next 30 years are “likely to bring a supercycle in investments in clean energy infrastructure, clean transportation and everything else that is required to make the green transition possible”, he said. The most recent supercycle managed a decade-long run, spurred by China’s demand for natural resources to stoke its infrastructure stimulus plans. This time a supercycle could be ignited by a rebound in demand after the Covid-19 economic hiatus, and a drop in value of the US dollar, which most commodities use to trade. But it will also be fuelled by the need to invest heavily in green infrastructure to help economies reach their climate goals. From China’s five-year plan to Europe’s Green Deal and Joe Biden’s economic stimulus plan, policymakers are looking to redistribute economic benefits, help the environment and create versatile and resilient supply chains, according to the US bank Goldman Sachs. The bank raised the prospect of a long-running bull streak for commodities at the end of last year. It warned that as governments ushered in a new era of policies to help economies recover from the pandemic, the next supercycle could echo the commodities boom in the early 2000s led by the sharp growth of the emerging Bric economies (Brazil, Russia, India and China). Big infrastructure projects are a tried and tested way to stimulate growth and spur employment. If these projects are green, such as windfarms or electric vehicle charging networks, they can help to tackle the climate crisis too. Both strategies require large amounts of metals including iron ore, copper, cobalt and lithium.
Daniel Major, an analyst at Swiss bank UBS, said the roll-out of electric cars and shift to cleaner energy were “the key megatrend for commodities” in the years ahead. A boom in such technologies could also accelerate demand for cobalt, nickel and copper, which are used to help make car batteries, charge cars, and distribute and store electricity. As mining companies begin to turn away from coal and towards the metals that help to drive a green recovery, more shareholder windfalls may follow."
2021-02-17T16:30:10Z,business,Business,Having almost the same number of people in jobs as a year ago is not a good sign | Greg Jericho,"In the lead-up to Thursday’s unemployment figures, the latest fortnightly job figures show that there were almost the same number of people employed in the last week of January this year as there were a year ago. But while that is certainly better than was the case for much of last year, we should not discount just how bad 2020 was. After the expected drop in jobs in the first couple of weeks of January, the latest release of payroll job index numbers from the bureau of statistics show a strong increase in the last half of January. The ABS estimates that there were 5.5% more people holding a job in the last week of January than in the first. But if that sounds like an incredible surge of jobs, just remember these figures are “original” and thus they don’t account for seasonal factors (such as Christmas and new year holidays). And the reality is that the increase in jobs in January this year was slightly less than it was last year:
Graph not displaying? Click here But still, at least the increase in work was there – even if it was broadly the usual that occurs every year. Given the hell workers went through last year, “the usual” is a nice change. As it is the figures suggest that the number of people with jobs is still just 2% below the number that was employed before the pandemic hitting in March. That is still a large number but there is hope that the gap will soon be erased given that the number of people employed at the end of January is roughly the same as the end of January 12 months ago:
Graph not displaying? Click here While the jobs in Victoria and Tasmania are well down on this time last year, South Australia, Western Australia and Northern Territory had more than 2.5% more jobs. But the comparison with the pre-pandemic situation shows there remains a gap to be filled. Victoria continues to be the state suffering the most but the gap between it and the rest of the nation is not so large as it was in September last year, although we will have to see what impact the latest five-day lockdown will have:
Graph not displaying? Click here So yes, some good news, but we must not forget that almost having the same number of people in jobs as was the case 12 months ago is not a good sign. Employment is meant to grow – not remain stagnant. Last year was the first year since 1992 that there were fewer people employed at the end than the start:
Graph not displaying? Click here Because full-time employment is more subject to economic downturns than total employment (people can shift from full-time to part-time and still be employed), 2020 was the fifth year since the 1990s recession where full-time employment went backwards. It is quite rare at any point for there to be fewer people employed than there were 12 months earlier. Since the ABS began calculating monthly employment in February 1978 it has only occurred in three periods:
Graph not displaying? Click here As a general rule, there are usually some 170,000 more people employed at any time than there were a year earlier. In December there were 63,900 fewer people employed. We will find out later on Thursday if we have got back into positive territory. If we do, it will be the quickest recovery from such falls. In the 1982-83 recession it took 15 months, and the 1990s recession needed 34 months – nearly three years – to get to a point where there were again more people working than there had been a year before. Right now the streak is nine months – it was deeper than ever before, but looks to be shorter because of the abnormal nature of this recession. Unlike previous recessions, this is one where lack of work is mostly linked to lack of the ability to actually be employed, given restrictions and lockdowns. Last year was a particularly bad year for women’s employment. It is extremely rare for women’s employment to fall in a calendar year – but it did in 2020 and the 1.1% fall in full-time work for women was greater than the 0.7% fall for male full-time employment. Before the latest January labour force figures the news looks mostly good compared with how bad things were. But the recovery of getting us back to where jobs grow at least as well as they normally do remains the challenge still to be met."
2021-02-17T15:58:07Z,business,Business,Adidas confirms plans to sell Reebok,"Adidas has confirmed plans to sell its Reebok brand after 15 years of ownership. Founded in Bolton, Lancashire, in 1958 and now based in Boston, Massachusetts, Reebok was bought by Adidas in 2006 for €3.1bn as part of its efforts to take on Nike. It is expected to be sold for less than €2bn (£1.7bn) as the brand has struggled despite the trend for sports clothing and athleisure, which has accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic. Potentially interested parties are thought to include VF Corporation, the owner of North Face and Timberland; Anta Sports, the Chinese sportswear firm; and Authentic Brands, the owner of Forever 21, Nine West and Juicy Couture. Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group also has a history of buying troubled British brands. The strong stock market debut of the bootmaker Dr Marten’s and a much-touted potential sale of the German sandal maker Birkenstock has increased appetite for comfortable footwear brands amid the shift to working from home. Rumours that Adidas and Reebok were set to part company have been circulating since the autumn. In November, Adidas said Reebok sales fell 20% in the nine months to 30 September, a slightly faster pace than the group’s core brand, as the company was forced to close stores during lockdown. Adidas had wiped hundreds of millions off the value of Reebok on its books in 2018, giving it an accounting value of €800m, after admitting that the brand’s earning potential had been overestimated. Adidas said it had completed an assessment of “strategic alternatives” for Reebok as part of a five-year strategy under which it intended to focus its efforts to strengthening the Adidas brand.
“The long-term growth opportunities in our industry are highly attractive, particularly for iconic sports brands,” said the chief executive of Adidas, Kasper Rørsted. “After careful consideration, we have come to the conclusion that Reebok and Adidas will be able to significantly better realise their growth potential independently of each other. We will work diligently in the coming months to ensure a successful future for the Reebok brand and the team behind it.” He said that under the “Muscle Up” plan that kicked off in 2016, the brand had improved its pace of growth and profitability prospects."
2021-02-17T15:44:04Z,business,Business,UK inflation rises to 0.7% in January; US retail sales jump â€“ as it happened,"Time for a recap Inflation in the UK has risen to its highest level in three months, and is probably heading higher. The consumer prices index rose to 0.7% per year in January, lifted by rising food prices and lower discounts on furniture. Clothing prices took a dive, though, as retailers slashed prices in the sales. Several economists predicted that inflation would head towards, or over, the Bank of Englandâ€™s 2% target this year - with rising shipping prices and Brexit costs likely to hit consumers in the pocket.
House prices inflation hit its highest level in six years, amid pressure for larger houses during the lockdown and the rush to beat the stamp duty holiday deadline. This lifted the average house price to a new record high of Â£252,000. Retail sales in the US have smashed forecasts, jumping by over 5% in January as Americans spent their new $600 stimulus checks. This has fuelled speculation that inflationary pressures are rising, giving the US dollar a lift. Bitcoin has also continued to rally, hitting new record highs over $51,000 today. Disruption caused by the fatal winter storms in Texas have pushed the oil price up to a new 13-month high, with Brent crude hitting $64 per barrel. Semiconductor plans in the region have also been forced to shut down, which could worsen existing chip shortages. Italyâ€™s new PM, Mario Draghi, has outlined his economic reform plans. Carmaker Ford has pledged to make its entire European offering all-electric by 2030.
Ryanair is to appeal to the European court of justice after losing the first round of its legal battle against state bailouts granted to rival flag carrier airlines such as Air France-KLM and Scandinaviaâ€™s SAS during the Covid-19 pandemic.

2021-02-17T15:12:22Z,business,Business,'Put a big fat price on carbon': OECD chief bows out with climate rally cry,"The environment, climate change and the protection of nature must be the defining tasks of rich and major developing countries now and in the years to come, the outgoing head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has said, and the institutions that advise governments must take responsibility for keeping them focused on those tasks. Ángel Gurría said the coronavirus crisis must be dealt with as a matter of urgency, but that the biggest task after that would be tackling the world’s environmental emergencies. “The single most urgent, emergent, immediate risk is to combat Covid-19, and its health, economic and social consequences,” he said. “But the single most important intergenerational responsibility is to protect the planet … We are on a collision course with nature and we have to change course for future generations.” The OECD secretary general listed the ways in which the world needed to act: “To protect biodiversity, to stop it from being degraded; to protect soil; to protect lands and water; to protect the oceans from the worst overfishing; to protect coral reefs, which are in danger of disappearing at 2C [of global heating]; to protect mangroves, which are extraordinary carbon sinks; glaciers and so on.” He added: “We are already seeing manifestations of how badly this [climate change] is happening, and this is going to get worse. The signals are that this going to be even more serious.” Gurría’s strong defence of the need for climate and environmental action comes at a crucial time, as the OECD council will announce his successor imminently, before 1 March. His successor will face a key choice: to continue advocating for climate action, to the discomfort of some governments, or to return the institution – as many businesses and politicians would prefer – to its conventional role of tracking gross domestic product and other standard economic indicators, and advocating growth without heed to environmental concerns. Gurría, who is ending his third five-year term, said the world was at a turning point, in seeking to recover from the economic blow of the pandemic. “We had a chance in 2008 to build back better – we blew it,” he said. “We got austerity, too fast and too soon. Have we blown it again? No, we have not blown it yet.” He urged countries to consider attaching environmental conditions to bailouts where appropriate, and to favour job-creating environmental projects for a green recovery. “And put a big fat price on carbon,” he added. The OECD is one of the most prestigious international institutions, part thinktank, part watchdog and part club of industrialised countries that emerging economies are eager to join. It wields considerable influence over developed and developing economies, not only by dispensing advice but also through choosing which indicators to use to judge countries and their governments’ performance. Poor reports by the OECD can affect a country’s credit rating, its cost of borrowing, and its attractiveness to investors. Gurría has spent his 15 years at the helm refocusing the OECD away from being a dry advocate of conventional free-market economics and into the unfamiliar territory of environmental and social issues previously seen as burdens or irrelevancies by economists. He has made the climate a personal crusade, speaking out at climate summits and international forums, and developing new systems within the OECD for tracking and reporting on countries’ environmental performance. “We never lose track [of environmental issues at the OECD],” he said. “We are constantly reminding our members never to lose track of the environment being their utmost responsibility.” One frontrunner to be his successor is Mathias Cormann, a former Australian finance minister, who has made it to the shortlist of four candidates. Scott Morrison, Australia’s prime minister, is lobbying hard, but green experts around the world fear that if appointed Cormann would try to impede the OECD’s climate and environmental work, despite making a statement that climate change would remain a priority. Green campaigners said Cormann’s record suggested hostility towards climate action and an enthusiasm for fossil fuel interests. Last February, he accused Australia’s Labor party of making “extremist pronouncements” for pledging to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Gurría refused to be drawn on his potential successor, and will play no role in the appointment. However, he made it clear where he thought the focus of the OECD should be in future. He pointedly suggested coal was one important area that should be tackled. “This [climate] is not a long term [issue]. We are talking about decisions we are talking today about technology, decisions countries are taking today about using coal. Not always in using coal themselves, but promoting coal-fired units, or selling or exporting coal to other countries – mostly developing countries,” he said. Gurría said whoever was chosen as the next secretary general, much of the work by the OECD on climate-related issues was likely to continue. The organisation works on issues including carbon pricing, subsidies that are environmentally harmful, calculating the hidden environmental and social costs of fossil fuels and other polluting industries. “These diagnostics … and a lot of the work of the OECD is already in play, already happening and will continue almost regardless of who comes,” he said.
Gurría said it had not been easy, when he took office in 2006, to persuade OECD member countries to focus on the climate: “In those days I got into a lot of trouble. But it was my duty to put out [analysis on the issues].” He added: “I would very, very much expect anyone who gets the job to be equally convinced, equally motivated and equally engaged with these issues.” Green experts said the OECD could play a crucial role in ensuring that future climate targets are met, as governments would listen to its advice. Helen Mountford is a former OECD executive who is now vice-president of climate and economics at the World Resources Institute, a non-profit research organisation. She said: “Climate change must be central to any successful candidate’s agenda. Leadership from the top to integrate climate across the full OECD agenda is essential. But implementing a sustainable, inclusive agenda will require all countries to engage.”"
2021-02-17T14:21:50Z,business,Business,Ryanair to challenge EU court ruling on French and Swedish state aid,"Ryanair is to appeal to the European court of justice after losing the first round of its legal battle against state bailouts granted to rival flag carrier airlines such as Air France-KLM and Scandinavia’s SAS during the Covid-19 pandemic. Michael O’Leary, the chief executive of the Irish airline, had accused nation states of “selectively gifting billions of euros to their inefficient flag carriers”. Ryanair has filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the European commission and various airlines over state-aid grants by European governments.
However, on Wednesday the Luxembourg-based general court ruled that state bailouts awarded by the French and Swedish governments – and approved by the European commission – were in line with the bloc’s rules. “That aid scheme is appropriate for making good the economic damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and does not constitute discrimination,” the court said, referring to the French scheme. Regarding the Swedish scheme, the court said: “The scheme at issue is presumed to have been adopted in the interest of the European Union.” Ryanair had taken issue with the European commission for clearing a French scheme allowing airlines to defer certain aeronautical taxes and Sweden’s loan guarantee scheme for airlines. Both schemes benefited their flag carriers. Ryanair has filed 16 lawsuits against the commission for allowing state aid to individual airlines including Lufthansa, KLM, Austrian Airlines and Portugal’s TAP, as well as national government schemes that mainly benefit flag carriers.
Europe’s biggest budget carrier said it would appeal the rulings at the EU’s top court, arguing that the French and Swedish programs mainly benefited Air France-KLM and SAS AB and unfairly discriminated against other European carriers. Ultimate victory would “give airlines and consumers a glimmer of hope that national politicians obsessed with their flag carriers will be sent back to the drawing board and required to use state aid wisely to assist the recovery of traffic in the post-Covid world instead of bailing out their favoured airline at the expense of fair competition and consumers”, Ryanair said on Wednesday. O’Leary has previously said: “These are the crack-cocaine junkies of the state-aid world because their first instinct is to always go to the government for state aid. We believe that any state aid in this crisis should be transparent and provided to everybody.”"
2021-02-17T13:47:01Z,business,Business,"Finance ministers have to be green in today's world, says OECD head","“Finance ministers have not always been green,” said Ángel Gurría, the outgoing secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, reflecting on his 15 years in charge of the club of wealthier nations. “But today, if you are not green, it probably means you died and no one told you.” The OECD occupies a powerful position, advising countries on economic policy and judging them on their performance, judgments that can sway investors and affect a country’s economy. Gurría said when he took office in 2006 that environment ministers tended to be left out of important decision-making by their governments, while the finance ministers who ruled the roost spurned green concerns. “Fifteen years ago, any meeting of environment ministers was like group therapy. They used to feel so lonely, they would tell each other stories so they would not feel so much alone.” Today, international institutions that have the power to influence finance ministers are increasingly talking about climate change and other environmental crises – hence the need for them to change tack. “Finance ministers are saying the right things now, and most are putting their money where their mouth is,” said Gurría. “[The climate] is no longer just a question for environment ministers – the leaders of the world have taken this up now.” As Gurría prepares to depart, a new generation of green-tinged and environmentally committed leaders – many of them women – are taking the helm at key institutions and playing a central role in ensuring governments stick to their green promises in future. They will play an important role as the world prepares for crunch climate talks at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow this November, where governments will be expected to come forward with pledges to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and plans to curb their country’s greenhouse gas emissions substantially in the next 10 years. Kristalina Georgieva took charge of the International Monetary Fund in October 2019 after a long career at the World Bank and then the European commission. She has made the climate a key priority for more than 20 years, saying last month that cutting emissions could be a source of growth for poor countries. “Building resilience can be good for nature and ecoystems; it can be good for economic growth; at a time when economies have lost low-skilled jobs, it boosts job creation; and it can bring health benefits [such as reduced air pollution],” Georgieva said. Her immediate predecessor at the IMF, Christine Lagarde, is now president of the European Central Bank. Shortly before the UK’s first lockdown took effect last spring, Lagarde came to London to help launch the Cop26 finance initiative. “Central banks need to devote greater attention to understanding the impact of climate change, including its implications for inflation dynamics,” she said at the time. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a former Nigerian economy minister poised to become the next director general of the World Trade Organization, has co-chaired the Global Commission on Economy and Climate since 2014. In 2018, she said adopting low-carbon aims would put developing countries on course towards a brighter future. “Now is the time to do this, before we lock in high-carbon infrastructure. Now is the opportunity for real sustainable growth.” Okonjo-Iweala is likely to prioritise climate issues in her new post at the WTO. Odile Renaud-Basso is the first woman to head a multilateral development bank, taking over last October as president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a major investor in eastern Europe, the southern Mediterranean and central Asia. She has vowed to make climate issues and investments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions a priority. Fatih Birol, th executive director of the International Energy Agency, has taken a key role in reshaping his institution to focus on the climate issue for more than two decades. He recently said countries must start to green their recovery from the Covid crisis as a matter of urgency: “Some countries did listen [to warnings]. They have done a good job and have followed a more sustainable path. But the majority of countries did not.” Whoever succeeds Gurría will also play a vital role in Cop26. The top four to succeed him are Mathias Cormann, a former Australian finance minister; Philipp Hildebrand, the vice-chair of the investment firm BlackRock; Anna Diamantopoulou, a former EU commissioner for employment and social affairs; and Cecilia Malmström, a former EU trade commissioner. Gurría’s advice to his successor is simple: “I am not pessimistic or optimistic – I am activistic. Pessimism leads to paralysis, optimism can lead to complacency. So just stay the course, stay with it. Let’s just heed the advice of science. Science will get us there.”"
2021-02-17T13:35:03Z,business,Business,British American Tobacco profits rise despite drop in sales,"The owner of cigarette brands including Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Camel has posted a near 9% rise in profits, despite lower sales partly caused by the pandemic. British American Tobacco (BAT) said the number of cigarettes sold fell by almost 5% last year, amid restrictions on travel that hit duty-free trade and and a sales ban in South Africa related to the Covid-19 crisis. However, price increases meant the total value of cigarettes sold rose. Sales of vaping kits – BAT sells under the Vuse and Vype brands – climbed 52%, with online vape sales up 40% as 17,500 people signed up as regular subscribers to BAT brands. Jack Bowles, the chief executive, said BAT had 13.5 million consumers of its non-combustible products, up 3 million on last year. Pre-tax annual profits rose to £8.7bn. Richard Hunter, the head of markets at Interactive Investor, said BAT had navigated a way to a “comfortable profit” thanks to cost savings – which hit £660m last year – together with the strength of its brands and growth in smoking alternatives. However, he said the company needed to keep a close eye on its £40bn of net debt. The shares, which have more than halved since 2017, fell by almost 5% in morning trading as the City was disappointed by the profit performance.
Hunter said: “The industry is one where, quite apart from changing tastes, the threat of litigation and regulation have been an overhang for some considerable time. Further out is the possibility that investors will eschew the tobacco sector as an investment destination, given the growing popularity of ethical considerations.” As part of aims to secure £5bn in sales of new products by 2025, the group began testing its first cannabidiol vaping products in Manchester last month."
2021-02-17T12:14:29Z,business,Business,Ford plans for all cars sold in Europe to be electric by 2030,"Ford has pledged that all of its cars on sale in Europe will be electric by 2030, in the latest move by the world’s biggest auto manufacturers to set out plans to move away from polluting internal combustion engines before looming bans on fossil-fuel vehicles across the world. The US car giant said on Wednesday that it was going “all in” on electric vehicles and would invest $1bn (£720m) converting a vehicle assembly plant in Cologne, Germany, to become its first electric vehicle facility in Europe. It said the first all-electric cars would start rolling off the production line there in 2023. Ford promised that all of its passenger cars in Europe would be “zero-emissions capable all-electric or plug-in hybrid” by mid-2026, before ramping up its ambitions to be “completely all-electric by 2030”.
“We are charging into an all-electric future in Europe with expressive new vehicles and a world-class connected customer experience,” Stuart Rowley, the head of Ford’s European operations, said. “Our announcement today to transform our Cologne facility, the home of our operations in Germany for 90 years, is one of the most significant Ford has made in over a generation. “It underlines our commitment to Europe and a modern future with electric vehicles at the heart of our strategy for growth.” Ford said two-thirds of its commercial vehicles would also be all-electric or plug-in hybrid by 2030. The company dominates the US and European markets for petrol-powered commercial vehicles with a 40% and 15% share of the markets, respectively. Ford said its commercial vehicle business was “key to future growth and profitability.” The carmaker, which returned to profit in Europe last year, has formed an alliance with Volkswagen to use its modular electric drive electric vehicle platform to build some models. The Cologne facility will use the VW platform. This month Ford said it was “doubling down” on electric vehicles (EVs) and would invest at least $22bn in electrification by 2025, nearly twice the company’s previous EV ambitions. This week Jaguar Land Rover, the UK-based carmaker owned by India’s Tata Motors, said its luxury Jaguar brand cars would be electric-only by 2025 and it would abandon petrol vehicles entirely in the middle of the next decade. Ford’s Detroit rival General Motors aims to have an entirely zero-emission lineup by 2035. The plans come as car companies race to transform their business to meet strict CO2 emission targets set by governments across the world. The UK has announced a ban on the sale of new cars and vans powered wholly by petrol and diesel from 2030. It is part of Boris Johnson’s call for a “green industrial revolution” to tackle the climate crisis and create new jobs in future technologies. The UK has set a target to be a net zero emissions economy by 2050. EU environment ministers struck a deal in October to make the bloc’s 2050 net zero emissions target legally binding. Norway, which relies heavily on oil and gas revenues, aims to become the world’s first country to end the sale of fossil-fuel-powered cars, setting a 2025 deadline. Fully electric vehicles make up about 60% of monthly sales in Norway."
2021-02-17T11:20:32Z,business,Business,"Neil Woodford needs permission to set up new firm, says FCA","The City watchdog has said that the one-time star investment manager Neil Woodford, whose funds were shut down in 2019, still faces the outcome of a regulatory investigation over the collapse and will need authorisation before his plan to return to the investment management business. In a highly unusual step, issuing a public statement about an individual’s business plans, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said Woodford’s comeback attempt was subject to securing its permission. Mark Steward, the FCA’s director of enforcement and market oversight, said WCM Partners – the new investment business announced by Woodford over the weekend in a Sunday newspaper interview – would need to win permissionbefore commencing a regulated activity in the UK. Steward also said the watchdog would consider whether Woodford is a fit person to run a new investment company. “In taking any decision on whether to authorise a firm, we consider whether it is ready, willing and organised to comply, on a continuing basis, with our requirements and standards. That includes, for example, the sustainability of the firm’s business model and the fitness of its management,” he said. Woodford, once one of the biggest names in British finance before his previous fund lost retail customers thousands of pounds and was forced to close, said on Sunday he planned to open a new firm based in Jersey and Buckinghamshire. The FCA said it was also in contact with the Jersey Financial Services Commission, the island’s regulator, and that they would share any information on applications. Unlike his scandal-tainted Woodford Equity Income Fund, which is subject to an investigation from the FCA, the former star stock picker said the new business would focus on professional investors rather than retail clients. However, questions have been raised over Woodford’s suitability to stage any such return to managing money. The fund manager and activist Gina Miller, best-known for mounting a legal challenge over Brexit but who has also campaigned on consumer protection standards, wrote to the Commons Treasury committee on Tuesday, urging an independent investigation. Alongside her husband and business partner, Alan, she issued a statement saying it was shameful that Woodford remained on the FCA’s register of authorised persons while its investigation “meanders on”. She said: “A conclusion to its deliberations does not appear to be in sight. This is nothing short of an insult to the hundreds of thousands of small investors whose lives have been turned upside down, many of which have lost their life savings.”
Steward said he recognised the time the regulator was taking could cause frustration among those who were affected, who are “understandably, looking for answers”. He said: “They rightly look to us to provide those answers. As a result, it is vital we investigate thoroughly and investigations are not limited at their outset. Instead, we look at what all the evidence tells us before we make conclusions about what, if any, misconduct has taken place and who is responsible, if it has. “It is only then that we can assess what, if any, sanction we should put in place. It is important as the decision makers on investigations that we do not prejudge their conclusion.”"
2021-02-17T10:16:07Z,business,Business,Rising inflation unlikely to be headache for Bank of England but will influence policy,"The UK government has had plenty of economic problems to worry about over the past year but rising inflation has not been one of them. Repeated lockdowns and the shift to online shopping have helped keep price rises in check. That period is now coming to an end. By the standards of the past – the mid-1970s, say – inflation is going to remain low this year. Unless things go badly awry, it should not become a real headache for the Bank of England. But it will start to influence policy. Even after the small rise to 0.7% in January, annual inflation as measured by the consumer prices index remained well below the government’s 2% target. At least, that is the best estimate the Office for National Statistics can provide in the circumstances. The ONS has tried to adjust for the change in spending patterns (far fewer flights) and has imputed prices for sectors that are closed (restaurants). The picture, broadly, was that clothing and footwear prices went down, while the cost of food, furniture and household goods went up. Bigger moves can be expected in the coming months, so that by April inflation is likely to be about 2%. First, there will be no repeat of last year’s collapse in oil prices. Motorists are already seeing the difference at the pumps from the recent jump in the cost of crude. Second, Ofgem has raised its utility price cap by 9.2% and energy companies are raising prices for domestic customers. Third, unless Rishi Sunak decides otherwise in the budget, the temporary cut in VAT for sectors such as hospitality will end.
It would come as no surprise to see inflation rise further over the summer. Many consumers are cash-rich after being deprived of spending opportunities, and a lot of businesses are clinging on by their fingertips. The combination of the two is likely to push up prices. Brexit will continue to have a temporary upward effect on inflation. Rising prices would only prompt a marked change in policy from the Bank of England if there were signs that it was leading to a surge in wage inflation. That doesn’t seem all that probable, given the sharp rise in unemployment over the past year. But the Bank will start to think about how and when to unwind some of the emergency stimulus it has been providing. Negative interest rates will be off the agenda. Neil Woodford’s hopes for fresh start gets frosty response Say what you like about Neil Woodford, the man sure has a lot of chutzpah. It takes a lot of gall to announce you are planning a comeback when your previous venture went belly up, with estimated losses to investors of about £1bn and an ongoing investigation into the collapse. Woodford, a man clearly not troubled by self-doubt, thinks he can once again be the darling of the fund management community. If the frosty response from the Financial Conduct Authority is anything to go by, it may be some time, though, before he has the chance to restore his tarnished reputation.
The FCA did not exactly say that it would bar Woodford from operating his new business in the UK but that was the gist of its message. It would consider whether the firm was “ready, willing and organised” to meet regulatory standards now and in the future. That judgment would depend on the soundness of the business model and the quality of its management. So, having considered Woodford’s recent record, is the FCA really going to approve his latest planned venture? Not a chance, even though the planned fund is said to be for professional investors only. What’s more, the FCA announced it would be sharing its thoughts about Woodford’s suitability with the authorities in Jersey in order to prevent him operating out of the Channel Islands. Woodford may see this as kicking a man when he’s down but it is what happens when you are deemed toxic."
2021-02-17T09:42:40Z,business,Business,Rio Tinto to pay out record $9bn in dividends for 2020,"Mining company shareholders have hit paydirt this year after Rio Tinto became the latest miner to reveal an investor windfall of $6.5bn (£4.7bn) following a boom in commodity prices and soaring company share prices. Rio Tinto, the world’s second largest mining company, reported a 20% rise in underlying profit to $12.4bn after demand for iron ore climbed as China’s economy bounced back from the coronavirus lockdown last year. Rio Tinto’s better-than-expected profits followed a sharp increase in global commodity prices like iron ore and copper following interruptions to global supplies that were partly caused by the pandemic. The miner will pay out a final dividend of $5bn and a special dividend of $1.5bn, bringing its total 2020 payout to $9bn, the biggest in the company’s 148-year history. The investor windfall follows a record dividend payout from BHP, the world’s biggest mining company, which will hand investors $5.1bn shortly after becoming the most valuable company on the London Stock Exchange. Mining rival Glencore reinstated its dividend – after scrapping payouts last August – at $1.6bn. Mining company shareholders are in line for the record dividends after many stock market-listed companies in the sector doubled their market valuations in the last year following the steep increase in commodity market prices. The price of iron ore, which is the most important commodity for Rio Tinto, rose last year to its highest levels since 2011 as China’s economy recovered faster than expected. That recovery led to greater demand for steel at a time when production of iron ore was disrupted in Brazil. Commodity prices are also being driven up by hopes that governments around the world will invest in building projects to help restart economies after the pandemic. BHP’s market value has more than doubled from lows in March last year to almost £124bn, beating Royal Dutch Shell and Unilever to the top of the FTSE 100. Glencore’s market capitalisation has climbed from £112.50 a share last March to highs of £289.85 this year. Rio Tinto’s share price has climbed from £29.68 a share to £62.68 a share over the same period.
Rio Tinto’s investor payout was bigger than expected as the group dealt with the fallout from the destruction of 46,000-year-old rock shelters in Australia’s Pilbara region last year. The anger following the destruction of the sacred site at Juukan Gorge led to Jean-Sébastien Jacques being replaced by Jakob Stausholm as chief executive. Unveiling his first set of full-year results, Stausholm said: “It has been an extraordinary year – our successful response to the Covid-19 pandemic and strong safety performance were overshadowed by the tragic events at the Juukan Gorge, which should never have happened. “My new executive team and wider leadership of the company are all committed to unleashing Rio Tinto’s full potential. We will increase our focus on operational excellence and project development and strengthen our [environmental and social] credentials. “We must earn the right to become a trusted partner for traditional owners, host communities, governments and other stakeholders, but we all recognise that this will require sustained and consistent effort.”"
2021-02-17T08:58:57Z,business,Business,UK inflation rises as price of food and furniture increases,"Rising food prices drove up inflation in January during the toughest coronavirus lockdown measures since the first wave of the pandemic. The Office for National Statistics said the consumer prices index rose to 0.7% in January – from 0.6% a month earlier – as shops including food retailers and household goods stores pushed up their prices with less discounting this year on items such as beds and settees.
However, there were also widespread January sales as the closure of non-essential shops forced retailers to cut their prices to sell stock where possible, including for clothing and footwear. Britain’s economy is expected to have plunged into reverse at the start of the year after narrowly escaping a double-dip recession, following the worst annual fall in gross domestic product for more than 300 years in 2020. With business and social life disrupted by the pandemic, inflation has fallen below the Bank of England’s target rate of 2% amid depressed levels of demand for goods and services. However, analysts said the inflation rate was likely to rise in the coming months, partly because the gauge measuring the annual growth of consumer prices would no longer be compared with pre-pandemic levels. That, and a 9% rise in the household energy price cap, is expected to lift inflation by the summer. The ONS said the inflation rate was pushed up in January by the rising price of frozen fish fingers, vegetables such as cauliflowers, and premium crisps. The biggest contribution was from furniture retailers and household goods stores, where there was less discounting of leather settees, double beds and fitted sheets.
Andy King, the head of consumer price inflation at the ONS, said the end of the Brexit transition period appeared not to have had a noticeable impact on prices last month, despite border disruption in the first month since leaving. “Overall, we didn’t see anything that jumped out to us as being a Brexit effect. There may be a number of factors to that. There were comments in the media about outlets looking to stockpile ahead of January but whether we’ll see anything when stockpiles diminish, though, obviously depends on costs. We only see prices to consumers, so it will also depend if companies choose to pass them on.” Analysts said Brexit had the potential to push up prices for consumers in future. Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at the investment company Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Supply chain problems aren’t set to ease any time soon. We’re also seeing global rises in the cost of shipping and commodities, which will feed into inflation eventually.” Having risen during the pivotal Christmas shopping period as fashion retailers attempted to claw back losses from one of the hardest years in living memory for the high street, clothing prices fell by 4.6% between December and January as a result of increased discounting. As the government prepares to announce measures to relax lockdown as progress is made with the vaccine programme, analysts say inflation is likely to rise further as the economy gradually reopens, driven by higher household savings in the crisis as people cut their spending.
However, rising unemployment and weaker household finances for many families, particularly those on low incomes, could keep a lid on demand as the economy takes time to recover from the biggest shock in centuries. Hannah Audino, an economist at the accountancy firm PwC, said: “Consumers will likely see an increase in the price of things like petrol, utilities and services this year, as global demand for oil picks up and demand recovers for the service sectors most impacted by restrictions, along with the VAT cut for hospitality coming to an end in April. “On the other hand, rising unemployment – expected with the end of the furlough scheme in April – will increase spare capacity in the labour market and subdue wage growth, putting downward pressure on prices.”"
2021-02-17T05:01:10Z,business,Business,"Oil firms should disclose carbon output, says BlackRock","BlackRock, the world’s biggest investor, has said that oil companies and other polluting industries should disclose their carbon emissions and set targets to cut them, in the latest sign of the rapid reassessment of climate risks by asset managers. All companies in which BlackRock invests will be expected to disclose direct emissions from operations and from energy they buy, known respectively as scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, the investment firm said in a letter outlining its plans. Fossil fuel extractors should base targets to cut emissions on the carbon released when their products are burned, known as scope 3 emissions, BlackRock said. BlackRock is one of the most influential investors in the world because of its vast actively managed and index-linked funds. The shares, bonds and other assets it controls were worth $8.7tn (£6.4tn) at the end of December, including holdings of billions of dollars in oil companies. Most major listed oil companies have already announced plans to disclose their carbon emissions, and reduce them in line with the target to reach net zero carbon by 2050 set by many governments across the world. BP plans to cut its carbon emissions to virtually zero by 2050, in part by offsetting emissions through carbon capture schemes and natural restoration. It has also promised to grow low-carbon investments eightfold by 2025, and tenfold by 2030, while cutting its fossil fuel output by 40% in the next decade. French oil firm Total has made several multibillion pound investments in renewable energy, and has one of the largest pipelines of clean energy projects of any major oil company. Shell has been criticised for putting forward climate plans which are vague, and rely on “carbon intensity” targets in the near-term rather than outright emissions figures. It plans to reach net zero in absolute terms by 2050. US oil company Exxon, considered a climate laggard, has committed to disclosing its emissions and has set near-term targets for reducing emissions, methane and gas flaring. Like Shell, the targets are based on carbon intensity rather than absolute emissions. BlackRock has long been a focus for criticism from activists who argued that it was not fulfilling its responsibilities. But in the last year it has started to vote against companies on climate grounds, in an abrupt turnaround. In 2020 it voted against management at 69 carbon-intensive companies, including on the re-election of 64 directors. BlackRock said last month it would target net zero carbon emissions in its portfolio by 2050, and that it would eventually consider divestment from the polluters who did not take action. Companies should set rigorous short, medium and long-term targets, BlackRock said. It highlighted the UN-backed science-based targets initiative as the leading example of an audited and reliable emissions reductions programme. Science-based targets are set to align companies with the aims of the 2015 Paris agreement of limiting global temperature rises to below 2C.
Activists welcomed the extra detail in BlackRock’s policy, but said it should insist on more specific reductions to ensure polluters move more rapidly. Wolfgang Kuhn, director of financial sector strategies at ShareAction, a campaign group, said: “These asks are totally necessary, and it is high time they were included in company engagement on a consistent basis. The issue is that they are in no way sufficient to get us out of the hole; the targets need to be ambitious, and companies need to explain how they are going about reducing their emissions. “Without concrete steps to reduce emissions, action for net zero doesn’t amount to much more than a bit of reporting on the side.”"
2021-02-16T19:31:51Z,business,Business,Hargreaves Lansdown co-founder cashes in £300m stake,"Peter Hargreaves, the self-made billionaire who co-founded Hargreaves Lansdown, is cashing in a £300m stake in the FTSE 100 investment firm he co-founded. The company confirmed that Hargreaves, who started the broker with Stephen Lansdown from a spare bedroom in Bristol in 1981, was selling £300m of shares via a placing with institutional investors. The 74-year-old businessman is Hargreaves Lansdown’s biggest shareholder with a near 24% stake worth almost £1.9bn. The planned share sale equates to about a sixth of his holding. Last year Hargreaves offloaded a slug of shares worth £580m. At that time he said it was “long-term financial planning to diversify my assets” and that he would continue to be a “substantial” shareholder in the investment platform. The news saw the shares close down 1% at £16.53. The stock has recovered from last year’s low of £12.77 but is still well below the 2019 high, when they were changing hands for £24.19. Hargreaves was not the only business founder selling shares on Tuesday, with Will Adderley, a member of the Dunelm founding family, selling nearly £200m of shares in the curtain and cushions chain. His mother and father started Dunelm from a Leicester market stall in 1979. Adderley sold 15m shares at £12.80 a go, raising £192m. He still retains a near 18% holding, with the family as a whole still speaking for 43%. With Britons stuck at home cash has poured into home furnishings, which has boosted the company’s worth to £2.6bn. The sale weighed on the shares, which closed down nearly 7% at £13.12. Hargreaves is a divisive figure as while he makes a point of paying his UK taxes – and last year gave £100m to charity – many cannot forgive his politics. In 2016 he made the single biggest donation to the Brexit campaign, handing £3.2m to the Leave.EU group. The money helped pay for an anti-EU mailshot to one in three homes in the country. Hargreaves has stood by that decision. Last year he said: “I don’t regret my Brexit donation one bit. I strongly believe we will be better out of the EU.” He added: “It was right that the money enabled the leave campaign to have as big a shout as the remain campaign. Remember, what they had was massive – they had Obama and the Bank of England pushing for remain. It wasn’t balanced at all.” He also gave £1m to the Conservatives’ election war chest, despite once labelling Boris Johnson a “buffoon”. “That donation was more anti-Corbyn than pro-Tory,” he said. “He would have turned this country into Venezuela.”"
2021-02-16T19:13:57Z,business,Business,British Gas to bump up energy bills by £97 a year for millions,"Millions of British Gas customers will be asked to pay almost £100 a year more for their gas and electricity after the regulator lifted its cap on energy bills. The UK’s biggest energy supplier confirmed that it would raise the price of its standard variable energy tariff by £97 a year, less than a fortnight after Ofgem said it would lift the cap to an annual average of £1,138 for a dual fuel bill. British Gas is the first major energy supplier to act following the energy cap rise, which is expected to impact 2.3 million of its customers who use the default energy tariff, and net the energy company almost £230m in extra revenues. A British Gas spokesman confirmed the price hike would be set to the maximum level allowed by the regulator. Other major energy suppliers are expected to follow British Gas by raising bills for up to 11m households on standard energy tariffs. The suppliers have been given the opportunity to raise their tariff prices by Ofgem which sets the upper limit for the average default energy bill based on the costs of supplying energy. A surge in global energy commodity prices has raised the cost of sourcing gas from the wholesale market, leading to a higher cap.
Ofgem’s price increase also includes a £23 hike to help suppliers such as British Gas claim back the cash they have missed because of unpaid bills during the coronavirus pandemic. It said the allowance would help energy suppliers to offer payment plans or emergency financial help to protect their customers – especially those in vulnerable circumstances. Energy suppliers are still allowed to chase customers for unpaid debts using debt collectors."
2021-02-16T19:01:02Z,business,Business,"Global markets at record highs; bitcoin hits $50,000 – as it happened","Right, time for a recap. Bitcoin has hit a fresh record high, scaling $50,000 for the first time and reigniting the debate over the cryptocurrencyâ€™s value, and future. Bitcoin surged to $50,600, a jump of over $2,000 today, taking its gains in 2021 to around 70%. It has now quadrupled in the last six months.
Some analysts said that bitcoin was benefitting from increased interest from institutional investors, with BNY Mellon and Mastercard both embracing crypto in recent weeks. Teslaâ€™s move to buy $1.5bn of bitcoin is another factor. But lawyers warned that bitcoin could face tighter regulation from policymakers. Central bankers expressed concern over bitcoin, with European Central Bank governing council member Gabriel Makhlouf comparing it to the 17th century Tulip bubble. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard insisted the US dollarâ€™s position as the global reserve currency was safe.
Global stock markets hit record highs, having rallied for 11 days in a row - the best run in three years, thanks to vaccine optimism and US stimulus hopes. There were strong gains in Asia, raising the prospect of a 12th day of gains - which would be the best since 2003. But European markets ended the day lower, a day after vaccine optimism drove stocks higher. Wall Street is looking a little mixed too (the Nasdaq is a touch lower, and the S&P 500 is flat).
Investors are extremely bullish about economic prospects, according to the latest survey from Bank of America. German investors are also more upbeat, anticipating a surge in consumer spending when the lockdown ends. The eurozone is still on track for a double-dip recession, though, although GDP fell slightly less sharply in Q4 than first feared. The pound hit a new 33-month high against the US dollar, as sterling moved close to the $1.40 mark. The surge in commodity prices in recent months has boosted the mining giants, with Glencore restoring its dividend and BHP Billiton announcing a record payout. Elsewhere...

2021-02-16T18:44:18Z,business,Business,Departing Glencore chief reinstates $1.6bn dividend despite $1.9bn loss,"Mining veteran Ivan Glasenberg delivered his final financial results as chief executive of Glencore by reinstating a dividend of $1.6bn (£1.15bn) for shareholders, despite reporting a net loss of $1.9bn for last year. Glasenberg will step down after 20 years as boss of the mining firm this June after a difficult 2020 in which Glencore was forced to scrap its $2.1bn dividend in August and write down the value of its assets by $5.9bn. He is now to reinstate the dividend after a strong rise in commodity prices in the second half of 2020, which helped the company to shrink its debt pile from the highs of $20bn last year and record better than expected financial results. Glencore’s adjusted earnings before interest, tax, debt and amortisation reached $11.6bn for 2020, in line with the year before and above analyst expectations of $10.7bn for the year. The commodity price surge also helped change the fortunes for BHP, the world’s biggest mining company, which revealed a record dividend of $5.1bn shortly after becoming the most valuable company on the London Stock Exchange. BHP’s half-year underlying profits hit a seven-year high of just over $6bn due to a rally in the market price for iron ore, which is used to make steel. The company’s market value has more than doubled from lows in March last year to almost £124bn, beating Royal Dutch Shell and Unilever to the top of the FTSE 100. Mining companies are hoping to benefit from the surge in demand for the metals required for low-carbon energy infrastructure and batteries – such as copper, nickel and cobalt – while bowing to investor pressure to end their contribution to the climate crisis. Glasenberg will leave Glencore with a roadmap to become net zero carbon by 2050, and promised to submit the surprise climate action strategy released last year for a shareholder advisory vote. He said it “is clear that meeting the goals of the Paris agreement has taken on even greater urgency” and that Glencore “is ready to support the transition to a low-carbon economy”. Susannah Streeter, a senior investment and markets analyst, at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Ivan Glasenberg has steered the commodities ship for nearly two decades, and before leaving the helm he’s nudged it on a greener course for the future. “Instead of sailing against the tide, Glencore has already committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, the first major miner with targets to fully align with the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change. Ramping up copper production while reducing its coal business is a big part of the strategy.” BHP has stopped short of committing to exit coal and gas production. It announced plans late last year to slash its carbon emissions by 30% over next decade on its way to becoming net zero carbon by 2050, and will link 10% of executive pay to the company’s environmental performance. But it intends to retain mines producing metallurgical coal, which is used in steel-making, and to keep its oil and gas fields."
2021-02-16T18:38:48Z,business,Business,TUC calls on Raab to reject Australian candidate to lead OECD,"The TUC has urged the UK foreign secretary to reject the Australian candidate to lead the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), saying it would set back the fight against poverty and the climate crisis. Frances O’Grady, the head of the trade union body, said she was concerned that the UK was preparing to vote in favour of Mathias Cormann, the former Australian finance minister who has a reputation for defending Australia’s mining interests and opposing urgent action on climate change. With four candidates left in the race to lead one of the most influential international bodies, O’Grady said Dominic Raab should reject Cormann in favour of the female candidates – the former EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström or the Greek academic and former education minister Anna Diamantopoulou – who she said had a track record of fighting poverty and tackling the climate emergency. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has hinted he will support Cormann, who is seen as taking the most aggressive stance on China, while it is possible Germany and the US could support the investment banker and former head of the Swiss central bank, Philipp Hildebrand, who has close links to Joe Biden’s White House team and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. The UK has not formally declared its preference but O’Grady said she was concerned about speculation that Raab was lining up to support Cormann. A Foreign Office spokesperson said the UK’s role in managing the selection process meant it would not publicly support a candidate. A decision is due by the first week of March for the secretary general post, which has always been held by a man. The OECD is one of several organisations that have become a battleground in recent years between the west and China over human rights abuses, trade and defence policy. Its 37 member countries, mostly in Europe and north America, though joined by Australia, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, New Zealand, Israel, Japan and South Korea, are also split over financial rules that aim to reduce the role of tax havens and tackle climate change. O’Grady said the OECD played an important role in providing analysis and policy advice to governments around the world and it was “vital to have someone who is a strong supporter of workers’ rights in this role”.
She said: “We are therefore deeply concerned about reports that the UK is considering supporting the candidature of Mathias Cormann as the new secretary general. Cormann was a member of the government of Australia that presided over severe wage stagnation, attacks on trade union rights and a rise in insecure work.” O’Grady added: “Despite recent attempts to restore his green credentials, his record on climate change is poor: as a senior minister in the Abbott government, Cormann attempted to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. “Supporting this candidate would send the wrong message in a year when the UK is hosting Cop26 and should be showing global leadership in this area,” she said."
2021-02-16T18:38:13Z,business,Business,Medicinal cannabis firm buoyed by London stock market debut,"Shares in a medicinal cannabis company, referred to as “the cannabis Nespresso”, almost quadrupled in value on their trading debut on the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday as investors scrambled to buy into the “wellness weed” market. Kanabo, an Israeli company that makes vaporised marijuana pods, saw its shares rise more than 292% to close at 18.5p. The shares, which launched at 4.75p, hit a high of 20.5p earlier in the day. The share placing, which raised £6m, was to fund research and clinical trials into using cannabis to treat insomnia. Avihu Tamir, Kanabo’s chief executive, said: “We could have secured at least £11m in investment but we had to stop sooner. “It’s a really interesting time to be involved in the sector and investors know this. It’s not just retail investors – we were surprised by the number of institutions who have already invested in Canada and are keen to join us and the others listing in London.” Kanabo makes a medical-grade vaporiser that uses cartridges of liquid derived from cannabis flowers. “It’s something my grandma can use,” said Tamir, who got into the industry after becoming one of the early recipients of medical cannabis in Israel.
“I found myself sitting in a clinic with a nurse teaching me how to roll a cannabis cigarette,” he said. Tamir said Kanabo’s vaporiser was an upgrade for patients and doctors because it delivered a precise 1mg dose with every inhalation, and would appeal to users who typically preferred an act similar to smoking rather than ingesting pills. Kanabo is the second medicinal cannabis company to list its shares on the London market in the past two weeks, and analysts said London could enjoy a “boom time” for cannabis listings following a Financial Conduct Authority ruling to allow such businesses to join the market. “[The FCA’s decision] could create a major European trading hub for cannabis companies which is currently dominated by Toronto and New York,” said Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at Markets.com. Shares in MGC Pharmaceuticals, an Australian medical cannabis company, rose 60% on its first day trading on the LSE last week – and are now 2.5 times higher than their 1.75p debut. A flurry of other medical cannabis companies are set to follow, including Cellular Goods, which produces a range of synthetic cannabinoid products and is backed by David Beckham’s DB Ventures company. Cellular Goods is expected to raise £8m through a share offer that would value the company at £20m.
Alexis Abraham, the chief executive of Cellular Goods, said: “There is a burgeoning market for high-quality cannabinoid products but the industry is currently highly fragmented and there is no go-to name that consumers can trust across product categories.” Cannabidiol, also known as CBD, is the non-psychoactive extract from cannabis that has a wide range of uses including relief from anxiety, depression and PTSD. Globally, the legal cannabis market is forecast to grow to £50bn in the next five years."
2021-02-16T15:26:05Z,business,Business,"eBay's $9.2bn Gumtree deal raises competition concerns, says CMA","A $9.2bn (£6.5bn) deal to create the world’s largest classified ads business could reduce consumer choice and increase the fees people are charged for advertising goods online, Britain’s competition watchdog has warned. Shpock operator Adevinta’s proposed purchase of Gumtree from eBay would combine websites that allow people to buy and sell used or new items such as clothes, electronics and furniture. The eBay marketplace is the largest such platform in the UK. However the Competition and Markets Authority said it was concerned the merger could lead to a loss of competition between Shpock, Gumtree and eBay’s marketplace, with only Facebook Marketplace remaining as a big competitor. “This could reduce consumer choice, increase fees or lower innovation in the supply of platforms that allow people to buy and sell goods online,” it said. The CMA said with the sale of the eBay Classifieds Group business, which runs Gumtree and Motors.co.uk, to Norway’s Adevinta, eBay would acquire a 33.3% voting stake in Adevinta and positions on its board, and would be able to influence the business strategy for Gumtree and Shpock. The deal, agreed in July, would make Adevinta, which was spun off from Norwegian publishing group Schibsted in 2019, the world’s largest classified ads business with annual revenues of $1.8bn. By offering eBay a big stake, Adevinta beat rival bidders including Naspers and Prosus, even though they offered eBay more cash as part of their bids. eBay had come under pressure from activist investors Elliott Management and Starboard Value to divest its classifieds business and cut costs in the face of rising competition from Amazon and Walmart. Adevinta and eBay have until 23 February to offer legally binding solutions to resolve the CMA’s competition concerns. The CMA then has five working days to consider whether to accept the offer instead of referring the deal to an in-depth investigation.
Adevinta said: “While Adevinta and eBay do not agree with the CMA’s reasoning, they will work constructively with the CMA and are confident in finding a suitable resolution.” It added that in 2019, eBay Classifieds Group’s UK business accounted for less than 10% of the division’s revenues while Adevinta’s UK business accounted for just 1% of its revenues. Gumtree was founded in 2000 by two former City traders, who sold the London jobs and flats website to eBay five years later. Many ads posted on Gumtree are free. Rocio Concha, the director of policy and advocacy at the consumer group Which?, said: “The case illustrates again that many digital markets have a small number of powerful firms and it is essential that the UK develops an effective competition policy for these markets.”"
2021-02-16T14:33:25Z,business,Business,Too tough or too timid? Joe Biden's stimulus package feels the heat | Larry Elliott,"It’s fair to say that Wall Street usually takes little interest in debates between economists, even ones as distinguished as Larry Summers and Paul Krugman. But the debate between the two Keynesians over the merits of Joe Biden’s stimulus package matters at a time when global stock markets are on their hottest run for 17 years. The mood has changed completely since fearful investors were piling into cash a year ago. The way the markets look at it, successful Covid vaccines plus low interest rates plus higher US government spending equals rapid growth and higher corporate profits. Summers says it might also equal higher inflation. He has two main quibbles with Biden’s $1.8tn (£1.3tn) plan: it will lead to overheating that will prompt higher interest rates and the possibility of recession; and there is too much focus on measures to boost consumer spending rather than investment.
At root, Summers is concerned that Biden is blowing his political capital, making it harder to lift the US out of what he calls secular stagnation – where the economy suffers a chronic lack of demand even when interest rates are at ultra-low levels. What the US needs, according to Summers, is higher spending on America’s decrepit public infrastructure, but the chances of getting that will be damaged if inflation takes off this year. Krugman however, reckons the US is effectively at war with the pandemic, and the question is not whether the stimulus plan will lead to higher inflation but whether it will help win the war. He doesn’t believe that the White House plan will be inflationary but says even if it is the Federal Reserve can respond with higher interest rates without causing a recession. The real political risk for Biden, according to Krugman, is that he is too timid, and waters down his measures in the face of criticism from the Republicans and some of the more conservative Democrats. That would reduce the chances of the package working and make it easier for the president’s opponents to say government intervention doesn’t work. Krugman says that is what happened to Obama after the financial crisis: he wasted his political capital by doing too little rather than too much. Inflation was notable by its absence in the US even during the pre-crisis period, and if price rises were kept in check when unemployment was at a 50-year low it is hard to imagine a permanent surge in the cost of living when the labour market is still weak. But in a sense, what matters is not what is going to happen but what the financial markets think is going to happen, and how the Federal Reserve responds. The US central bank sides with Krugman and his view that inflation poses little threat, which is one reason share prices continue to scale fresh heights daily. But US bond yields are rising and even the hint of a Fed change of heart would puncture the bullish mood.
Pubs hoping for Boris delivery The idea that lockdown was bad for our livers because we all took to the bottle to drown our sorrows is not true according to research from Public Health Scotland and the University of Glasgow. The amount of alcohol consumed per head of population dropped by 6% across England, Scotland and Wales between March and July last year. Digging a bit deeper, though, the study found a significant surge in off sales of almost 30%, which didn’t quite offset the impact of drinking in pubs and bars. All of which helps explain why the British Beer and Pub Association is desperate for some news when Boris Johnson announces the plan for easing restrictions next week. And why it looks like a good time for online home delivery specialists to be floating on the stock market. Virgin Wines is targeting a £100m flotation; Deliveroo a possible £7.5bn offering. Both are examples of the pandemic-induced shift in consumer behaviour."
2021-02-16T13:58:53Z,business,Business,Former Goldman Sachs analyst and brother charged with insider dealing,"Two brothers who worked at Goldman Sachs and leading City law firm Clifford Chance have appeared in court charged with insider dealing and fraud. Mohammed Zina, 32, who worked as an analyst at Goldman Sachs, and his brother Suhail Zina, 33, who worked as a solicitor at Clifford Chance, appeared at Westminster magistrates court on Tuesday charged with six offences of insider dealing and three offences of fraud by false representation. The brothers are accused of making a profit of about £142,000 from insider dealing in shares of companies including Arm Holdings and Punch Taverns in 2016 and 2017, according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The pair are also accused of three counts of fraud related to loans totalling £95,000 taken out from Tesco Bank. The brothers are said to have told the bank they intended to use the funds for home improvements, when the loans were allegedly used to fund the insider dealing scheme.
The case was sent to Southwark crown court for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 16 March 2021. Fraud is punishable by a fine and/or up to 10 years’ imprisonment. Insider dealing is punishable by a fine and/or up to seven years’ imprisonment. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs said: “The protection of client confidential information is of paramount importance to Goldman Sachs. The firm treats any misuse of client confidential information with the utmost seriousness. Neither the firm nor any other current or former employee of the firm is the subject of an investigation into the matters giving rise to the proceedings.” The spokesperson added that Mohammed Zina left the bank in 2018. His brother is understood to have left Clifford Chance in the same year, having qualified in 2017. The law firm declined to comment."
2021-02-16T12:27:24Z,business,Business,"Most UK pubs could not reopen under April beer garden plan, says industry","More than half of pubs would not reopen and the rest would be at the mercy of the weather, under tentative plans to allow beer garden service from April, the industry trade body has said. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said 29,000 pubs, about 60%, do not have a big enough garden or outdoor area to welcome drinkers without also needing to open indoor areas. The prediction comes amid speculation that the government will permit pubs to welcome guests outside from April, easing some of the pressure on a sector that has been among the hardest-hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The BBPA is pushing for permission to serve customers indoors as soon as non-essential shops are allowed to reopen. It said about 75% of pubs have some outdoor space but only 40% could open it if restrictions on indoor movement persist. Most of those that could open would not break even due to the logistical challenges and unpredictable April weather, it said. “Even if some pubs did try to open outdoors only in April, all it would take is some heavy rain and they would find it has all been for nothing,” said the BBPA chief executive Emma McClarkin. “For many pubs, gardens are at the back and the only way to access them is through the inside. And of course, toilet facilities would still need to be provided. “We question the government’s thinking behind this and suggest they consult with us as a sector on it.” The trade body estimates that lasting restrictions on indoor service would mean just 17% of UK pub capacity would be available, resulting in £1.5bn of lost turnover compared with normal times. Pubs that could only open partially would require continued government grants, the BBPA said.
“We urge the government to open our pubs inside – and outside – when non-essential retail also opens. By then, the vaccine will have been rolled out to millions more, and pubs can open while continuing to follow exemplary hygiene measures, world-leading standards in guidance and social distancing. “Until then, the government must do all it can to support our sector until it opens to trade properly in the upcoming budget.” The Guardian has approached the government for comment."
2021-02-16T10:13:45Z,business,Business,Virgin Wines to float for about Â£100m next month ,"Virgin Wines is to float on the London Stock Exchange next month with a valuation of about £100m as the Covid-19 pandemic increases demand for its home-delivered wines. The company, bought out of Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin group in 2005, mostly sells wine through its WineBank and Wine Plan subscription schemes, but also on a pay-as-you-go basis. It has 169,000 active customers, of which 147,000 are members of its subscription schemes. The company has benefited as people have been spending far more time at home during the pandemic, and pubs and bars have been shut during lockdowns. It said customers were spending more to buy high quality wine. The off-trade market for wine specialists was estimated to be worth £2.4bn last year. Jay Wright, the Virgin Wines chief executive, said: “We have enjoyed strong, consistent growth recently resulting in the group delivering more than 1m cases of wine to consumers during 2020. Underpinned by the strength of our customer proposition as well as the benefit of many positive consumer trends, we have a clear strategy to continue this growth over the coming years.” The company plans to list on London’s junior Aim market on 2 March and is targeting a valuation of £100m. It is following in the footsteps of Deliveroo, Moonpig and the Hut Group, which have also opted for stock market debuts and benefited from big pandemic-related shifts in consumer spending. Moonpig raised £20m in new money to fund further expansion when the online greetings card and gift retailer listed on the stock market in early February, and it is now valued at £1.56bn. City investors have been eager to snap up shares in internet businesses that have thrived during the pandemic. The Hut Group, which runs websites for retailers including Asda and Tesco and provides technology to Nestlé, Unilever and Danone, floated in September at £4.5bn and its shares jumped by a quarter on the first day, in the biggest London stock market debut since 2013. Deliveroo, the London-based takeaway delivery service, is drawing up plans for a stock market flotation that could reportedly value it at up to £7.5bn next month. Virgin Wines is one of the UK’s biggest home delivery wine businesses along with its former owner Direct Wines’ Laithwaite’s Wine, a family-owned business, and Naked Wines.
Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: “The IPO [initial public offering] is obviously opportunistic and I don’t think it’s as good a business as Naked [Wines], but anything online walks out the door these days.” As demand for online wine orders and home delivery has surged, Uber acquired the alcohol delivery service Drizly for $1.1bn (£790m) earlier this month. The deal will allow the ride-sharing company to offer beer, wine and spirits in most US states in addition to the groceries and prescription delivery service it has launched in some areas. Vivino, a San Francisco-based wine app that was founded in Denmark in 2010, recently raised $155m in an investor funding round. It said at the time: “Alcohol e-commerce sales worldwide have grown immensely, and it is estimated that by 2024, they will exceed $40bn.”"
2021-02-16T10:00:48Z,business,Business,Democrats urge Biden to fire USPS chief Trump ally who decimated mail service,"Even in a drama-filled election unlike any other, the postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, and his assault on the postal service stood out. After Trump appointed the businessman to run the agency, DeJoy largely failed in his mission to help the former president discourage voters from casting ballots by mail, but evidence suggests his policies and the pandemic have decimated the postal service. Now many, including Democratic lawmakers, are calling on Biden to act swiftly to remove him and the Trump-majority UnitedStates Postal Service board of governors.
Though Biden doesn’t have the authority to remove DeJoy himself, he could immediately appoint a Democratic-majority board that could fire the postmaster general, but the administration has yet to act. That’s left many asking “Why?” “We think he can move quickly and should move quickly and should be bold – there’s no debate about anyone being confirmed by the Senate, so let’s make it strong and powerful,” said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. But it might take some time for that to happen. Representative Gerry Connolly, chair of the subcommittee on government operations, which oversees the postal service, labeled DeJoy a “huge problem” and is calling on Biden to fire the entire board, but told the Guardian he doesn’t think it’s “a fair question” to ask why the president hasn’t acted during his first three weeks in office. “Give him a little bit of time. We’re dealing with huge problems – a pandemic, huge economic challenges, he’s got to make cabinet appointments, he’s got his environmental agenda,” Connolly added. “But this needs to be on the priority list and I believe it will be.” Representative Tim Ryan, who in January sent a letter to Biden calling on him to “clean house”, stressed that late bill payments, late checks and delayed medication deliveries cause problems for many Americans and underscored the urgency. Though DeJoy has refused to release 2021 on-time delivery data, December numbers made public in lawsuits shows that only about 40% of first class mail was arriving on time – down from about 92% the year before. Those who spoke with the Guardian agreed that the delays affect Americans’ daily lives more than sub-cabinet appointments at a federal agency like the Department of Commerce. “We’ve got to hit the reset button because there’s no confidence in DeJoy and the board of governors who obviously have lost all control, and that’s inflicting pain on working-class people in places like Ohio,” Ryan said. Connolly said part of the delay in Biden taking action could stem from the administration “wrestling with” a strategy to remove DeJoy and deal with the board, which currently holds four Republicans and two Democrats. Biden could appoint three new Democrats, and that majority could, in theory, fire DeJoy. But some, like Connolly and Ryan, are calling on Biden to fire the entire board, including its Democrats, who Connolly accused of not providing meaningful resistance to DeJoy’s assault. “They’ve gone along to get along and that’s not what we needed,” Connolly said. “We needed forthright voices calling out DeJoy, so I believe they’re part of the problem, not part of the solution.” Ryan said the Biden administration didn’t respond to his letter, and he suspects that it may fear that immediate action would “create a lot of chaos”. Dimondstein also noted that the board is composed of older white men with no experience in the industry and who want to run the postal service as a business, when it’s actually a service. “We’re asking him to fill the openings immediately with strong postal service advocates and to bring some diversity to the board,” Dimondstein said. That includes someone who represents the interest of rural America, which relies heavily on the postal service because private delivery companies often won’t serve it. There’s also the symbolism: DeJoy, a Trump donor, was appointed to his role in May and immediately set to work enacting controversial changes that dramatically slowed first class mail service in critical swing states where large numbers of Democrats were expected to vote by mail. That’s viewed by many as an attack on democracy and weaponization of an essential service. “If you needed a reminder of how quickly this can become a political hot potato, that was it, and you ignore it at your own peril,” Connolly said. The postal service’s struggles don’t end at DeJoy. Its workforce has been flattened by the pandemic and officials say the operation is in need of a cash infusion and tens of thousands of additional employees. Its ageing equipment and 25-year-old delivery truck fleet are designed to largely handle first class mail but the postal service increasingly delivers packages, which makes the operation significantly less efficient. Meanwhile, a 2006 reform bill required the post office to pre-fund 75 years of its retiree healthcare costs, which has been a financial drag. Bipartisan legislation already introduced in the Senate and House would repeal the 2006 law, but Connolly said he was preparing a “more comprehensive” package that would address other major issues. Democrats are having “internal discussions” about the best approach, he added. Meanwhile, Ryan called on the federal government to provide relief to those who have incurred late fees or had credit scores dinged as a result of slowed mail service. Dimondstein applauded all the ideas, and said the USPS was also well-positioned to expand the services it offers, suggesting ideas like postal banking or electric vehicle charging infrastructure should the fleet be upgraded. That would help generate new revenue, but, regardless of what Democrats do, Dimondstein said they need to move quickly: “People are watching and patience is going to run thin.”"
2021-02-16T09:00:47Z,business,Business,Revealed: Monsanto owner and US officials pressured Mexico to drop glyphosate ban,"Internal government emails reveal Monsanto owner Bayer AG and industry lobbyist CropLife America have been working closely with US officials to pressure Mexico into abandoning its intended ban on glyphosate, a pesticide linked to cancer that is the key ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup weedkillers. The moves to protect glyphosate shipments to Mexico have played out over the last 18 months, a period in which Bayer was negotiating an $11bn settlement of legal claims brought by people in the US who say they developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma due to exposure to the company’s glyphosate-based products. The pressure on Mexico is similar to actions Bayer and chemical industry lobbyists took to kill a glyphosate ban planned by Thailand in 2019. Thailand officials had also cited concerns for public health in seeking to ban the weedkiller, but reversed course after US threats about trade disruption. So far the collaborative campaign to get the Mexican government to reverse its policy does not appear to be working. The Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has given farmers until 2024 to stop using glyphosate. On 31 December, the country published a “final decree” calling not only for the end of the use of glyphosate but also a phase-out of the planting and consumption of genetically engineered corn, which farmers often spray with glyphosate, a practice that often leaves residues of the pesticide in finished food products. The moves are for the “purpose of contributing to food security and sovereignty” and “the health of Mexican men and women”, according to the Mexican government. But Mexico’s concern for the health of its citizens has triggered fear in the United States for the health of agricultural exports, especially Bayer’s glyphosate products. The emails reviewed by the Guardian come from the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) and other US agencies. They detail worry and frustration with Mexico’s position. One email makes a reference to staff within López Obrador’s administration as “vocal anti-biotechnology activists”, and another email states that Mexico’s health agency (Cofepris) is “becoming a big time problem”. Internal USTR communications lay out how the agrochemical industry is “pushing” for the US to “fold this issue” into the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal that went into effect 1 July. The records then show the USTR does exactly that, telling Mexico its actions on glyphosate and genetically engineered crops raise concerns “regarding compliance” with USMCA. Citing discussions with CropLife, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) joined in the effort, discussing in an inter-agency email “how we could use USMCA to work through these issues”. The documents about the Mexico matter were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) and shared with the Guardian. “We’re seeing more and more how the pesticide industry uses the US government to aggressively push its agenda on the international stage and quash any attempt by people in other countries to take control of their food supply,” said Nathan Donley, a biologist with the CBD conservation group. Building alarm The records show alarm starting to grow in the latter part of 2019 after Mexico said it was refusing imports of glyphosate from China. In denying a permit for an import shipment, Mexican officials cited the “precautionary principle”, which generally refers to a policy of erring on the side of caution in dealing with substances for which there is scientific concern or dispute over safety. An email from Stephanie Murphy, Bayer’s government affairs executive, to Leslie Yang, USTR’s director for international trade and environmental policy, noted the rejection of the glyphosate shipment and said Mexico was “alleging that ‘glyphosate represents a high environmental risk, given the credible presumption that is use can cause serious environmental damage and irreversible health damage …” Murphy asked if she could “discuss the situation further” with USTR and see if there was “an opportunity for engagement given USMCA”. She said the industry lobbying group CropLife America was reaching out to the US Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and Bayer executives were “working closely with FAS” at the American embassy in Mexico. “As of today, Bayer has not been impacted on imports”, but the company expected problems ahead, Murphy warned ina 5 December 2019 email.
A meeting between US and Mexican officials was held in January 2020 and a USTR “briefing paper”, prepared as guidance for the meeting, included the glyphosate issue as a key concern to be discussed with Luz María de la Mora, Mexico’s undersecretary for foreign trade. The paper specified as one talking point the United States’ concern that the rejection of glyphosate imports was done “without a clear scientific justification”. In February 2020, Bayer’s Murphy again reached out to the USTR’s Yang, forwarding information she said was gleaned from a meeting in which Mexico’s ministry of environment and natural resources “claims to have scientific evidence about the dangerous effects of glyphosate, and also plans to conduct a study particular for Mexico, with assistance from international organizations”. By March, Mexico’s actions on glyphosate and genetically engineered crops needed “urgent attention”, according to a letter sent from Chris Novak, CropLife president, to Robert Lighthizer, USTR’s ambassador, copying the heads of the USDA and the EPA. Mexico’s actions were “incompatible with Mexico’s obligations under USMCA”, according to the CropLife letter. CropLife is funded by Bayer and other agrochemical companies. Bayer’s Murphy followed that correspondence up with more emails to USTR’s Yang about a need for “high level political engagement”. Then in May, Lighthizer wrote to Graciela Márquez Colín, Mexico’s minister of economy, saying the GMO crop and glyphosate issues threatened to undermine “the strength of our bilateral relationship”. CropLife’s Novak sent an August 2020 letter thanking government officials for “all your assistance” but said more was needed as Mexico has “virtually ceased processing registrations of new pesticide products”. More than glyphosate sales at risk Throughout the months of email correspondence, industry executives told US government officials that they feared restricting glyphosate would lead to limits on other pesticides and could set a precedent for other countries to do the same. Mexico may also reduce the levels of pesticide residues allowed in food, industry executives warned. “If Mexico extends the precautionary principle” to pesticide residue levels in food, “$20bn in US annual agricultural exports to Mexico will be jeopardized”, Novak wrote to US officials. Corn and soybeans exports to Mexico would be particularly at risk if the country stopped allowing glyphosate residues in food, according to the communications between industry and the USTR.
The agrochemical industry and US regulators maintain pesticide levels in food are not harmful, but many scientists disagree and say even trace amounts can be dangerous. Mexico is a key US trading partner, accounting for $614.5bn in total goods imported and exported in 2019. Key exports to Mexico include about $3bn in corn exports. Given that roughly 90% of US corn production is genetically engineered, the ban on GMO corn would be a big blow to US farmers. It is unclear if the efforts to push Mexico to change its policy position are still under way within the new Biden administration. The USTR did not respond to a request for comment. Bayer also declined to answer questions about the company’s actions regarding Mexico, but said glyphosate and genetically modified crops are safe and Mexico’s restrictions would “cause major disruptions” for Mexican farmers and would impact food security in Mexico. A spokesman for the EPA said the agency regularly engages with officials in Mexico and “has not taken any regulatory actions against Mexico’s decisions on glyphosate or GMO corn”. The agency has offered to share its scientific findings with Mexico’s government, the spokesman said. CropLife’s Novak told the Guardian that Mexico’s actions to ban glyphosate set “a dangerous precedent” that ignores farmer needs and “undermines the integrity of scientific standards as the foundation for global trade”."
2021-02-16T09:00:46Z,business,Business,Who really owns the largest slice of Wall Street?,"Robinhood wants to “democratize finance”, according to its mission statement. And, for a brief period last month, the trading app seemed to be doing just that as small investors appeared to be battering Wall Street investors who had bet on the demise of GameStop, AMC cinemas and other. The long-term fallout of a saga that gripped the world is still unknown and regulators are poring over the sudden rise in shares of GameStop and others. But what is true is that share ownership in the US is still anything but democratic – the vast majority of people who trade in shares are already the wealthiest slice of society. A massive 84% of all shares held by American households are owned by the wealthiest 10%. These figures come from a 2017 study by the economist Edward N Wolff who used data from the Survey of Consumer Finances to reveal just how skewed US stock ownership is.
Wolff notes that the concentration of stocks in the hands of the wealthy has huge consequences for wealth inequality. Rather than owning stock, the wealth of the middle class was largely invested in home ownership, meaning that this slice of American society was deeply affected by the housing price drop that began in 2007. That sting has been even sharper given that real wages have barely risen over the past 40 years. And, since the US is a country where economic inequality overlaps with racial inequality, there are other clear patterns in stock ownership. While stock ownership makes up 17% of white household wealth in the US, it represents just 3% of the wealth in Black and Hispanic households."
2021-02-16T01:58:34Z,business,Business,BHP says Chinese ban on Australian coal adding to Mount Arthur mine's woes,"The BHP chief executive, Mike Henry, says a Chinese ban on Australian coal has added to the woes of BHP’s Mount Arthur coalmine, which the company has already written down by US$1.2bn and is trying to sell. Writedowns of Mount Arthur and other coal assets helped drive BHP’s profit for the six months to the end of 2020 down by 20%, even as booming iron ore prices led to a rise in operating profits and a record dividend payment to shareholders.
An unofficial ban on coal from Australia has seen as many as 60 ships at a time queued up off the Chinese coast, costing suppliers tens of thousands of dollars a day in demurrage fees. BHP said the Chinese ban was hurting the markets for both thermal coal, which is burned to make electricity, and the higher-quality coking coal, which is used in the steelmaking process. It was a “key uncertainty” in the thermal coal market while uncertainty about China’s attitude to coking coal has “spiked”, the company said as it announced its half-year results on Tuesday. “The industry faces a difficult and uncertain period ahead,” it said. The company’s attempts to sell Mount Arthur are part of a plan to get out of thermal coal, but it aims to retain its coking coal assets. Amid gloom about coal’s long-term prospects, BHP expects the mine to run at a loss this year – it costs almost US$66 a tonne to produce coal that the company predicts will fetch between US$55 and US$59 a tonne. The mine has also been running at less than full capacity since November, when a shiploader was damaged in an accident at the nearby Port of Newcastle. BHP has revised its plans for running the mine, based in part on geological information, Henry said. “But we have also seen very different market circumstances, with the widening of the spreads between different coal qualities and a change in the markets to which we are able to sell Mount Arthur coal given the ban on Australian coal imports into China,” he said. “All of those taken together have seen us go back and review what the appropriate product quality is that we wish to be selling, what the right mine plans are to produce those and what the mine plans are.” He said BHP was also aware of the cost of rehabilitating the open-cut mine once it closes. “We are very aware of future needs to remediate and address closure any time we divest an asset, and that has a bearing on the sorts of parties we would be willing to sell to and the structure we would put behind it,” he said. China’s policy on coal burned to make electricity is a “key uncertainty” in trade of the fossil fuel, BHP says. The company also says uncertainty about China’s attitude towards metallurgical coal, which is used to make steel, has “spiked”.
Ships carrying coal banked up off the Chinese coast late last year after authorities refused to let them come to port – an action widely interpreted as being due to increasing trade tensions between the two countries. “Trade flows are adjusting to account for the available opportunities,” BHP told the ASX. BHP’s half-year profit fell to US$3.87bn compared to the same period in 2019, driven down mostly by a total of US$2.2bn in exceptional items that included slashing the value of the thermal coal assets and US$200m of covid-related costs. But profits from its operating business, which is dominated by iron ore, soared by 17% to US$9.8bn. It declared its biggest-ever interim dividend, of US$1.01 a share."
2021-02-16T00:01:37Z,business,Business,Coventry to seek planning permission for electric car battery 'gigafactory',"Coventry city council intends to secure pre-emptive planning permission for a “gigafactory” beside the city’s airport to make electric car batteries, in the latest effort by UK authorities to attract investment. The government has identified investment in battery factories as a key goal to keep automotive jobs as the sector moves away from the internal combustion engine. Only one company, however, a startup called BritishVolt, has so far announced a project to build a UK battery factory. A joint venture between Coventry council and Regional City Airports will seek outline planning permission by the end of 2021 in the hope of attracting an experienced manufacturer to start production by 2025. BritishVolt has secured rights to a site in Blyth, Northumberland, for a proposed gigafactory near Nissan’s Sunderland plant, but it has yet to secure funding to start building. Many in the industry believe the West Midlands will also require a battery plant to supply carmakers such as Aston Martin Lagonda, BMW and the taxi and van company LEVC. The urgency of developing a UK gigafactory was underlined on Monday by Jaguar Land Rover, the largest UK car industry employer. JLR said it would switch its Jaguar brand to pure electric technology by 2025, before ceasing all production of petrol and diesel vehicles by 2036, meaning it will require hundreds of thousands of batteries a year. JLR’s chief executive, Thierry Bolloré, said: “If there might be one day a battery plant or several plants, why not in the UK? We would be very, very glad. It would make a lot of sense in terms of supply chain to be close by any battery plant.” An industry insider, however, said it would take definite demand from a UK manufacturer before a UK gigafactory would be viable. Andy Street, the mayor of the West Midlands, said the identification of a preferred site was “a huge leap forward”. • This article was amended on 17 February 2021. A previous version incorrectly placed Blyth in “Northumbria”, rather than Northumberland."
2021-02-16T00:01:36Z,business,Business,Calls for post-Brexit reforms of UK competition law,"The government should launch sweeping reforms of competition laws to improve consumer confidence, lower costs for businesses and boost the UK economy after Brexit, according to a leading Tory MP. John Penrose, a prominent backbench MP commissioned by the government last year to explore post-Brexit opportunities for UK competition policy, said ministers needed to launch a new parliamentary act to update Britain’s consumer institutions to reflect the rise of the digital economy. Calling for the changes in a report published on Tuesday, he said the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) regulator needed more power to be given tougher penalties to companies that do not cooperate fully in investigations. The watchdog should also work out a way that lets customers easily compare the “price” of free online services. Many digital companies, such as Google and Facebook, do not charge customers for many of their services but instead gather customers’ data, used to give them insights that allow adverts to be targeted at consumers. The “CMA must consider how to improve transparency of the price consumers are paying through their data for digital goods and services, so they can make informed choices about whether each one represents good value or not, and whether they wish to switch to others which might be better,” the report said. The findings of the Penrose Review come as ministers attempt to stake a claim that leaving the EU will present businesses and consumers with new opportunities that will boost the economy and raise living standards. The government has so far faced a chorus of complaints from business leaders over its handling of Brexit, amid a mountain of new paperwork for exporters and delays. While Boris Johnson has said these are “teething problems” that will fade, company bosses warn that additional costs of doing business after Brexit are an endemic feature of leaving the EU that will hold back Britain’s economy. In the 69-page report prepared by Penrose, the Tory MP said “the opportunities for post-Brexit Britain to cut red tape costs ought to be immense”. As part of the review, he said ministers should reintroduce a “one in, one out” rule used by David Cameron’s coalition government that forced ministers to scrap an old regulation if they wanted to launch a new one. He said the government had promised in 2018 to cut £9bn from the cost of doing business in Britain by reducing red tape, but removing the one-in-one-out “gateway condition” had led to costs rising by an extra £8bn instead. Red tape refers to rules governing business practices, which often include health and safety standards, consumer protections and measures to protect the environment. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, said the government would consider the findings of the review. “The UK’s competition laws and institutions are highly regarded across the globe. However, as we build back better from the pandemic and start life as an independent trading nation, we have a golden opportunity to strengthen that reputation,” he said."
2021-02-16T00:01:36Z,business,Business,IFS urges Rishi Sunak not to raise taxes and to extend support for economy,"Britain’s foremost economics thinktank has urged Rishi Sunak to use next month’s budget to announce a targeted extension of government support to tackle a “triple challenge” to the economy from Brexit, Covid and global heating. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the chancellor needed to steer clear of raising taxes in response to record peacetime borrowing of about £400bn inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic and called on him instead to focus on supporting the UK’s economic recovery from lockdown. In an intervention as Sunak prepares to deliver the 3 March tax and spending set-piece in the Commons, the IFS said additional support was needed to help Britain adjust to the triple economic challenges presented by Brexit, Covid and meeting targets for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The leading thinktank on the public finances said that despite record sums being borrowed this year, an extension in the multibillion-pound furlough wage subsidy scheme beyond the end of April was needed. Having supported the wages of 10m jobs at more than 1m businesses since it was launched in March last year, the IFS recommendation echoes calls made by leading business groups, Labour and trade unions in recent weeks. The thinktank said that while wage support should be removed eventually, a gradual-phasing out of the system was needed to protect jobs and growth. It also said there was “no need” to phase out a £20-a-week increase in universal credit benefit payments launched at the start of the pandemic as a temporary step, adding to the pressure on Sunak to make the uplift permanent. “Given that basic support for the childless unemployed has not risen in 50 years as earnings have more than doubled, and is much less generous than in many comparable countries, there is a case for maintaining this increase,” the IFS said. Keeping the measure would come at a long-term cost of about £6.5bn, but removing it would mean 6 million low-income families seeing their benefit income fall by £80 or more between March and April. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said: “In the recovery phase, he [Sunak] needs to support jobs and investment, but also crucially needs to recognise and address the multiple inequalities exacerbated by the crisis.” Over the longer term, the thinktank said, the public finances were not on a sustainable footing as a result of the economic damage inflicted by Covid-19 on the exchequer, as well as growing demographic pressure on public services from an ageing population. It said sizeable tax rises would be necessary in future to meet enduring weakness in revenues for the exchequer, while keeping inflation low. As much as £60bn could be required to ensure that government revenues cover day-to-day spending, it said. However, Johnson said there was a huge degree of uncertainty about how large the lasting impact from Covid would be for the economy and that the chancellor should not commit to permanent changes now. “It is possible that growth will be fast enough that big fiscal deficits will largely dissipate of their own accord. But that is not a central expectation; more likely we are on track for ongoing unsustainable deficits. For now, Mr Sunak needs to focus on support and recovery. A reckoning in the form of big future tax rises is highly likely, but not as yet inevitable,” he said. A Treasury spokesperson said it had invested more than £280bn throughout the pandemic to protect millions of jobs and businesses. “At the upcoming budget, we’ll outline the next stages of our Plan for Jobs to support businesses and families across the UK. That has been our priority throughout the past year and it will be the priority for the year to come.”"
2021-02-16T00:01:36Z,business,Business,First UK homes with hydrogen boilers and hobs to be built by April,"The UK’s first homes to be fitted with boilers and hobs that run on hydrogen rather than fossil fuel gas will be built in Gateshead by April. The semi-detached houses in the north-east will use 100% hydrogen for heating and cooking in appliances including boilers, hobs, cookers and fires under a new government scheme intended to offer the public a glimpse into “the potential home of the future”. The government hopes to create entire “hydrogen neighbourhoods” and even a “hydrogen town” by the end of the decade as part of its plan to cut the carbon emissions from UK homes and become a net-zero carbon nation by 2050. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the energy minister, said the two houses “will showcase how low-carbon hydrogen can transform the way we power our homes and offer a glimpse of what the future holds as we build back greener”. Using fossil fuel gas for heating and cooking is responsible for about 30% of the UK’s emissions, but burning hydrogen is emissions-free and could play a key role in helping the UK to meet its climate targets by blending with existing gas supplies or replacing gas entirely. Ministers are soon expected to set out a detailed strategy for the future uses of hydrogen, which could also be used to cut emissions from heavy industry and the transport sector.
The role of hydrogen in UK homes is considered controversial by some in the energy industry who believe it would be safer and more efficient to use electric hobs and heat pumps. Hydrogen can be costly to produce without contributing to climate emissions because it relies on either using renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen to make “green hydrogen”, or using carbon capture technology to prevent the emissions released by splitting fossil fuel gas into “blue hydrogen”. The Gateshead houses will run on tanks of regular hydrogen – so-called “black” or “grey” hydrogen, made from hydrocarbons – provided on site, rather than via the local gas grid which still uses fossil fuel gas. The first homes in the world to use green hydrogen through a local gas grid will move ahead in Fife, Scotland by the end of next year."
2021-02-15T18:18:27Z,business,Business,Sterling reaches $1.39 in best performance for three years,"The pound has hit its highest level against the dollar for almost three years as global markets were buoyed up by hopes for a faster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Sterling rose by 0.5% to hit a 33-month high against the dollar on Monday, trading above $1.39 on the global currency markets for the first time since 2018, while also rising to a nine-month high against the euro of almost €1.15. Against a backdrop of growing optimism amongst global investors over the economic rebound from the crisis and rising commodity prices, the FTSE 100 closed up 2.5% at 6,756, marking the biggest daily gain for more than month. The biggest risers included British Airways owner IAG, which climbed 7%, National Express, which rose 11%, and cruise line Carnival, which ended the day up 8%. The positive figures came after more than 15 million people in Britain had been offered their first coronavirus vaccine, and as Boris Johnson prepared to outline a roadmap next week for easing lockdown restrictions this spring. The UK’s Brexit deal, despite evidence of problems with cross-border trade a month on from leaving, has also relieved pressure on the currency. Hopes for a swift global rebound were underscored by Japan’s leading stock market index hitting the highest level for more than 30 years, after closing above 30,000 on Monday. The Nikkei 225 index, which tracks the value of Japan’s biggest companies, rose 1.9% to finish the day up at 30,084.15. Wall Street was closed for Presidents’ Day. The Nikkei breached the 30,000 mark after official figures showed Japan’s economy growing by 3% in the final months of 2020, a stronger showing than expected. Japanese gross domestic product (GDP) for the year as a whole shrank by 4.8%, the worst performance since 2009, when the financial crisis rattled the global economy. It comes after the UK recorded a 9.9% fall in GDP last year, the worst performance among the G7 group of wealthy nations.
Analysts said global markets had started the week on a high as investors remained confident that disruption from continued lockdowns at the start of 2021 would soon give way to an economic boom as restrictions are relaxed. Brent crude hit a 13-month high on Monday, reaching more than $63 per barrel, with tin hitting a seven-year high and copper an eight-year peak. However, concerns still remain over the threat from new coronavirus strains and the damage to businesses after a year of Covid disruption. Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “The boost to sentiment is a global story reflected in Japan’s Nikkei-225 hitting a 30-year high and with Asian stocks in general posting big gains. The long-awaited US stimulus is a big contributor, along with vaccines, to the positive mood.”"
2021-02-15T17:47:39Z,business,Business,Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala will find the WTO a challenge – but the only way is up,"With Donald Trump’s departure, it was only a matter of time before Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was appointed to run the World Trade Organization. Joe Biden could have maintained Washington’s objection to the former Nigerian finance minister becoming the first woman and the first African to run the Geneva-based body, but has sensibly decided not to. Like the football manager taking over a team struggling at the bottom of the table, Okonjo-Iweala is in the happy position of taking over at the WTO when the only way is up. Of all the big multilateral economic organisations, the WTO is the toughest gig: trade is a hugely contentious issue and yet decisions in Geneva are made by consensus. The old days when trade deals were a stitch-up between the United States and the Europeans are long gone. There has not been a successfully completed round of trade liberalisation talks since 1993. The WTO’s ability to police global trade is in doubt because the US has blocked the appointment of new judges to its appeals body. No question, Okonjo-Iweala is going to have her work cut out. She has no real background in trade, although that may prove to be less of a handicap than some of her critics imagine. The last two WTO director-generals – Roberto Azevêdo and Pascal Lamy – struggled to make much progress with trade liberalisation despite knowing the subject inside out. Okonjo-Iweala believes a politician rather than another technocrat has a better chance of sorting out the WTO’s problems – and she is right because each of the three big challenges she faces has a political dimension. The first is to accept that the Americans (backed privately by a number of other countries) have a point when they say judges on the appeals body are there to interpret trade law, not make it. The US will not fully engage with the WTO – under any president – until that happens. The second is to repair the strained relationship between the three main players in global trade: the US, China and the EU. That is no easy task given a breakdown in trust but ought to be helped by a fading of protectionist pressures as the global economy recovers from the pandemic. Finally, it will be 20 years in November since the WTO launched the now moribund Doha round of trade talks in which the needs of developing countries were supposed to be central. A properly functioning global trading system would make the most vulnerable nations more resilient and reduce the gap between rich and poor countries. A test of Okonjo-Iweala’s leadership will be whether she can deliver on this unfinished business. Markets see post-Covid UK as emerging market economy Something got lost in translation on Monday as Boris Johnson and the financial markets responded to progress on the government’s vaccination programme in markedly different ways. The prime minister said a cautious but irreversible approach would be taken to easing the lockdown restrictions that have put the economy into midwinter hibernation. Meanwhile, currency and equity traders behaved as if it was already spring. The pound hit its highest level against the dollar in almost three years at just under $1.40, and the FTSE 100 index of leading shares – which often suffers when sterling is strong – rose by more than 2.5%. It would be as well not to get too carried away. For many decades, $1.40 was a support level for the pound, below which it fell only once – and then briefly – in the mid-1980s. And despite yesterday’s rise, the FTSE remains about 10% down on where it was before the Covid-19 crisis. Sure, financial markets tend to focus on the future rather than the present. True, the noises coming out of the US are that interest rates will stay low may have helped weaken the dollar. No question, the UK’s vaccine programme has been impressive. Rising commodity prices boosted share prices too. But in a sense the UK looked a bit like an emerging market economy: assets now look cheap and there are investors out there who are willing to take a punt when the appetite for risk is strong. That’s fine, of course, up until the moment when the mood changes; then the hot money can leave as quickly as it arrives."
2021-02-15T17:17:56Z,business,Business,JLR to make Jaguar brand electric-only by 2025,"Jaguar Land Rover, the UK-based carmaker, will make its Jaguar brand electric-only by 2025 and abandon petrol vehicles entirely in the middle of the next decade as part of a set of sweeping changes brought in by its new chief executive. The company, which is owned by the Indian conglomerate Tata, will eliminate the internal combustion engine for its struggling Jaguar brand by 2025, as JLR aims to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2039.
The more profitable Land Rover brand will launch six pure electric cars within the next five years, although it will continue to offer hybrid cars combining internal combustion engines with batteries until about 2036. JLR, which employs 30,000 people in the UK, will also “substantially reduce and rationalise” its UK management. It did not reveal how many job losses were planned. None of JLR’s main factories will close. However, Castle Bromwich, a West Midlands plant whose future has been in doubt as production slowed, will not build a previously announced electric version of Jaguar’s flagship XJ, or any other new models as it steps back from being a mass-production plant. Instead, Castle Bromwich will produce existing models only, and JLR will gradually consolidate other operations scattered around the West Midlands to the factory. Production of all Jaguar models will be concentrated in a Solihull plant. The new strategy is the first public statement of intent by Thierry Bolloré, a former boss of France’s Renault, since he was appointed chief executive of JLR in July. Although the company returned to profit in the last quarter of 2020, it struggled more than some rivals during 2020 as carmakers faced reduced sales from the coronavirus pandemic, heavy electric technology investments and disruption at the border before the Brexit deal. JLR slipped behind Nissan as the largest manufacturer of cars in the UK in 2020, when it made 244,000 vehicles, but Bolloré said the company would target quality and profits over volume. He faced the task of accelerating Jaguar Land Rover’s move to battery electric vehicles to meet the UK government’s ban on pure internal combustion engine cars by 2030. JLR has already garnered high praise for its sole pure electric model, the Jaguar I-Pace SUV, but that car is built in Austria by a contractor, meaning JLR still lacks in-house electric car manufacturing expertise. It will attempt to rectify that with annual investments of £2.5bn in research and development of new electric technologies, including work on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Matthias Schmidt, an independent automotive analyst, said JLR’s decision to abandon petrol and diesel by 2036 was roughly in line with EU emissions limits that are effectively impossible to meet with internal combustion engines. JLR has already paid a fine of £35m for 2020 after missing its emissions reduction target. A loophole making emissions targets easier for smaller manufacturers will be gradually closed from 2026. Unite, the trade union representing large numbers of JLR workers, welcomed the electric vehicle plans but said it was not offering unconditional support. Des Quinn, Unite’s national officer for the automotive industries, said: “Assurances of no plant closures and no compulsory job losses have been sought and given, and it is on this basis only that we will work with the company to meet the challenges of the future.” Bolloré said the restructuring would be focused on “dramatically reducing the layers of management in the company”, as well as simplifying its purchasing from suppliers and making some components itself.
He said JLR was “human-sized among giants” of the automotive industry but insisted the company could use that to its advantage by acting more like an agile technology company. Bolloré has already moved his management team out of its previous base in Whitley to Gaydon, further south of Coventry, to be nearer to the company’s design hub. The biggest challenge for the carmaker’s net zero carbon ambition was cutting the third of total emissions that came from suppliers, many of which are small businesses in the West Midlands, Bolloré said. However, he insisted that JLR had an opportunity to build greener brands that will appeal to wealthy customers. A new Range Rover starts at more than £83,000, although cheaper Land Rovers retail at about £32,000. Electric technology “embodies everything that a modern luxury vehicle should be,” Bolloré said. “Luxury is clean.”"

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index has closed 166 points higher at 6756 points, a gain of 2.5%. Thatâ€™s its highest closing level in a month, having hit a three-week intraday high earlier in the session. Thatâ€™s also the Footsieâ€™s best day since 6th January, when the City was enjoying a New Year bounce. The success of the UKâ€™s vaccine rollout, and the prospect that the lockdown would be rolled back in the coming weeks, lifted shares in travel companies and hospitality firms. Earlier today, prime minister Boris Johnson told reporters that the UKâ€™s plan to lift the current lockdown would be â€˜cautious but irreversibleâ€™. Johnson also said the government would provide target dates for sectors to reopen â€œif we possibly canâ€� when he reveals his roadmap for releasing lockdown next week.
Hotel chain Whitbread was the top riser on the FTSE 100, closing 7% higher, followed by British Airways parent company IAG (+6.7%). Oil companies also led the charge, with BP and Royal Dutch Shell up around 6% after crude prices hit 13-month highs today.
The smaller FTSE 250 jumped by 1.8%, with UK-focused companies such as retailer WH Smiths up 12%, travel operator National Express gaining almost 11%, and cinema chain Cineworld up 10.5%. Markets across Europe also rallied, with the Stoxx 600 jumping 1.4%. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA Europe European stocks are enjoying a very strong start to the week, led by energy stocks as WTI jumps above $60 for the first time since the pandemic hit. Thereâ€™s real momentum behind the global recovery trade and with every passing week, it seems investors are becoming more optimistic about it. The vaccine rollout is providing enormous encouragement, with the UK surpassing 15 million vaccinations and the topic of conversation finally turning to reopening the economy. Cases and fatalities are falling rapidly due to a combination of the vaccine and the lockdown and the progress of the last two months should ensure restrictions are eased for the last time starting in a few weeks. The UK economy has suffered worse than most this last 12 months but could now be positioned for a powerful recovery. The pound remains at a 33-month high tonight, over $1.39, as it approaches levels seen in the run-up to the EU referendum in June 2016.

2021-02-15T16:53:19Z,business,Business,Jaguar Land Rover’s low-carbon plans end mass production at Castle Bromwich plant,"Jaguar Land Rover’s announcement of a low-carbon future also contained significant news for its historic Castle Bromwich plant. JLR said it would end mass production of cars at the site before 2025, after decades of assembly at a facility with an illustrious past which rivals that of any UK factory. The plant was brought to the brink of closure in 2010, before JLR staged a dramatic U-turn. A decade later, fears for its future were rising again as production fell, but once more it has been granted an unexpected reprieve. JLR has pledged to unions that there will be no compulsory manufacturing redundancies because it will consolidate other operations at the West Midlands site. The Castle Bromwich plant started as an airfield serving the nascent aviation industry as early as 1909. It was taken over by the Royal Flying Corps – the RAF’s predecessor – in the first world war, before it was identified as the site for an aircraft factory shortly before the second world war. That decision put Castle Bromwich at the centre of the British war effort, churning out more than 12,000 of the Spitfire fighters that played a prominent role in the Battle of Britain, as well as Lancaster bombers. The site still has a morgue – albeit unused – that serves as a morbid reminder of its past as a bombing target for the Luftwaffe. After the second world war the plant was taken over by a car body pressings company, Fisher & Ludlow. Through mergers it eventually became part of British Leyland. Jaguar took on the site in 1977, staying there through periods of ownership by Ford and the current owner, Tata, an Indian conglomerate. The factory will continue to produce Jaguar’s existing lineup for a few years but it will not add new models. The models built at the site are the XE and XF saloon cars and the F-Type sports car. However, on Monday JLR reversed a decision to build an electric XJ saloon there. Ian Henry, the owner of the AutoAnalysis consultancy, said the Castle Bromwich plant had a paint shop and metal pressings facility that could be used for Jaguar’s special vehicle operations, a lucrative sideline in limited edition, high-performance cars. But its days as one of Britain’s great mass production car plants appear to be over."
2021-02-15T16:30:26Z,business,Business,"Yes, the Liberals will run a scare campaign. But Labor should tackle negative gearing anyway | Greg Jericho","As Labor prepares for a possible election later this year, its negative gearing policy looks likely to be either abandoned or at least altered. While this could be spun as a politically good move, negative gearing and the current capital gains tax discount remain bad policies that need to be changed. In the 1986-87 cabinet papers when the Hawke government decided to reinstate negative gearing after pressure from industry lobby-groups, the poor Treasury officials rather lacked a reason to do so. The best they could come up with was that “it was anticipated that other tax shelters would be closed” but had not, and thus it should be reinstated. It was the first of many bad negative gearing policies all of which vainly try to pretend they are not a tax shelter. But it was in 1987, and so it remains – and looks likely to do so into the future if reports of Labor reconsidering its policy are accurate.
It’s no real shock that the ALP might dump the policy it took to the past two elections, as it seeks to blame those losses on policy rather than the selling (and seller) of the policy. But let us be clear, any political party seeking to do something about housing affordability needs first to change negative gearing and the ability for people to get a 50% discount on capital gains tax rate. And such a policy is greatly more vital than, for example, another idea currently pushed by government backbencher Tim Wilson to allow people access to their superannuation to buy a home. It is important to note that negative gearing and capital gains discount are inexorably linked, for it was the introduction of the latter by John Howard and Peter Costello, which set fire to the former:
Graph not displaying? Click here Prior to the change, as many landlords recorded a rental profit and they did a loss; but afterwards, suddenly a lot more people began recording losses. And with the increase in the number of people claiming a rental loss, so too was there an increase in the average amount of loss people were claiming and an increase in the amount of capital gain people were recording:
Graph not displaying? Click here Rarely has there been a policy combination so perfectly attuned towards encouraging people to become housing investors purely for the purpose of tax minimisation. And rarely as well has there been a combination of taxation minimisation policies so perfectly attuned towards causing house prices to soar:
Graph not displaying? Click here If you want to improve housing affordability, capital gains tax and negative gearing must be the first place to start. Unfortunately, the 20 years of damage caused by the Howard government cannot be undone, but there is no reason to continue that damage. And we should also note that while many people negative gear, overwhelmingly the benefits go to the wealthiest.
Those earning under $87,000 account for nearly 80% of all individuals in the tax system, but just under 70% of those who negative gear and they record just 60% of all rental losses. By comparison, those who earn over $150,000 account for 6% of all individuals, but accrue 20% of all rental losses:
Graph not displaying? Click here Similarly capital gains are recorded overwhelmingly by the richest:
Graph not displaying? Click here Negative gearing and the capital gains discount are little more than tax rorts designed to assist the wealthiest. But it is perhaps understandable that it is politically difficult to remove negative gearing. While those who work in the highest paying occupations are more likely to negative gear, it is no small thing for any political party that, for example, 10% of librarians or 11% of primary school teachers also negative gear:

Graph not displaying? Click here While there may become resentment towards those who use this tax loophole, this ire is less directed towards those who own just one property, rather than, say, towards government backbenchers who with their partner own four investment properties. Thus one move could be to limit the ability to claim losses on just one property. Were this administratively difficult, the losses able to be claimed could also be capped.
A cap on the claimable rental loss of $10,000 would cover a vast majority of people earning under $150,000 and would at the same time take away the incentive to have a multiple number of investment properties:
Graph not displaying? Click here We know that whatever the ALP does the Liberal party will lie and call it a property tax or a retiree tax or a tax on ambition. But the dumping of any changes to negative gearing or capital gains tax out of fear of the political consequences would be a bad move. If the ALP really wants to do something about housing affordability, it must act."
2021-02-15T10:05:59Z,business,Business,Harvester owner to raise £350m from 'Sandy Lane set',"The owner of Harvester restaurants and Nicholson’s pubs plans to raise £350m from a group of tycoons known as the “Sandy Lane set” after it came close to breaching the terms on its debts. Mitchells & Butlers said it had agreed the equity raise with three investment holding companies as part of a £500m rescue package that also included a £150m three-year loan facility. The rescue investors include the currency trader Joe Lewis, the Irish billionaires and horse racing tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus, and Derrick Smith, another businessman with horse racing interests. They are known collectively as the “Sandy Lane set”, after the glamorous Barbados hotel where they liked to gather. The investors will merge their various investment vehicles into one company, called Odyzean, in a structure that will give them majority control. The tightening of the investors’ grip comes with M&B struggling during the latest national coronavirus lockdown in the UK. In January, the group, whose brands also include All Bar One, O’Neill’s and Toby Carveries, said all its sites were closed and that it was left with only £125m in cash. It owns 1,600 pubs, bars and restaurants and employs 40,000 people in the UK. At the same time, the company was burning through £35m to £40m a month and was due to make a debt payment of £50m on 15 March. In 2010, the same investors were the subject of an inquiry by the Takeover Panel after Mitchells & Butlers complained they were working together to take control of the company without making a formal bid. However, M&B said it had consulted the Takeover Panel, who had said no formal bid was required and that Odyzean was free to buy more shares.
The new shares will be issued at 210p per share, a steep 36% discount on M&B’s closing share price on 12 February. On Monday shares in M&B closed up 7.9% at 354.5p. The share price had hit a five-year high above 420p shortly before the Covid-19 pandemic struck the UK. Bob Ivell, M&B’s chairman, said: “Mitchells & Butlers was a high-performing business going into the pandemic, and this capital raising and refinancing will provide the business with the certainty of funding that it needs in order to emerge in a stronger position.”"
2021-02-15T06:00:06Z,business,Business,ISS updates proxy voting policy against directors who fail to address climate crisis,"Major financial investors are to be urged by the world’s largest shareholder advisory firm to vote against company board members if they fail to address global heating in their roles, amid renewed pressure on firms with poor environmental track records. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which issues advice to some of the world’s biggest fund managers, has updated its proxy voting policy including changes that allow it to recommend votes against company directors over “material failures … including, demonstrably poor risk oversight of environmental and social issues, including climate change”. The policy shift, which came into force on 1 February, will influence voting recommendations across the 44,000 company reports produced by ISS each year. ISS, founded in 1985, is believed to account for about 61% of the proxy advisory market, and together with its rival Glass Lewis, tends to hold sway over roughly 20% of shareholder votes used to govern the running of publicly listed companies. The firm covers firms in 115 countries and counts 2,000 institutional investors – including asset managers, pension funds and hedge funds – among its clients. ISS also casts about 10.2m voting decisions a year for its clients, representing 4.2tn shares. According to a report by the campaign group ShareAction, major asset managers including Legal and General Investment Management (LGIM), BlackRock, HSBC and Schroders regularly use ISS reports to inform their voting decisions at annual shareholder meetings. But ShareAction said ISS should have gone further in its climate policy, which is weaker than its position on gender equality. Wolfgang Kuhn, ShareAction’s director of financial sector strategies, said: “The timidity on climate change is disappointing.” “Proxy advisers have significant influence on asset managers’ voting behaviour and it is long overdue for them to take a stronger position on climate change. But there is little to celebrate in this policy,” Kuhn said. “Even where directors exhibit ‘demonstrably poor’ oversight on climate risks, ISS will only ‘consider’ recommending a vote against. Contrast this with ISS’ position on gender diversity, which states that it will ‘generally vote against’ the chair of boards with poor gender diversity,” he added. However, ISS’ new proxy voting guidelines will give extra backing to a growing number of asset managers such as LGIM and BNP Paribas Asset Management, and Sarasin & Partners, which are already waging battles with companies over their environmental policies. Federated Hermes – which manages £453bn worth of assets – announced in November that it would also begin voting against company chairs if their corporate strategy is “materially misaligned” with the goals of the Paris Agreement, which is meant to limit temperature rises to 2C and avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. Tim Goodman, a director at EOS, the stewardship arm of Federated Hermes, said: “Climate change is a systemic risk, and as such the directors of companies have a responsibility to mitigate rather than exacerbate that risk. “As we enter AGM season, we’ll be looking closely to ensure the chair and responsible directors of companies fully grasp this reality. We will recommend voting against board members if they fail in that responsibility.” It joins LGIM, which has had a policy of voting against directors over climate issues since 2016. “We take pride in our stance, but are aware that net zero is not a zero-sum game. We need more investors to put pressure on companies to step up, and welcome this strengthened policy from ISS.” ISS declined to comment."
2021-02-15T06:00:02Z,business,Business,Race to lead OECD narrows to four candidates,"The race to lead the Organisation for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD), one of the world’s most influential multilateral organisations, has narrowed after the deputy head of the organisation withdrew from the race. The exit of Ulrik Knudsen, who is a former Danish foreign minister, leaves four candidates for the secretary general post, including two women: the former Greek education secretary Anna Diamantopoulou and Cecilia Malmström, the Swedish EU trade commissioner who spent four years in Brexit talks with the UK. Ángel Gurría, who has run the OECD since 2006, will step down later this year amid growing conflict over how fast to tackle climate change, a crackdown on tax havens and the role of China among the OECD’s 37 member countries, mostly in Europe and north America, though joined by Australia, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, New Zealand, Israel, Japan, and South Korea. The Swiss candidate – Philipp Hildebrand A former head of Switzerland’s central bank who quit in 2012 following an insider trading scandal, Hildebrand has close connections to the German leader, Angela Merkel, and the new Biden administration through his boss at fund manager BlackRock, the fabulously well-connected Larry Fink. A liberal working in an investment bank makes him the Keep Calm and Carry On candidate who is onside with the Washington consensus, which could be important after Chris Liddell, a former Trump aide, withdrew as US contender. The Greek candidate – Anna Diamantopoulou After a long career in both Greek and European politics – having worked on education, industrial policy, and social justice – Diamantopoulou is the centre-left candidate who talks about nitty gritty issues, focusing on digital transformation, green growth, reducing poverty and updating skills. She would get many votes if OECD members agreed with her mission to “soften this big conflict” with China. In the secretive voting process, which mimics the race for the papacy, her leftist views and long period in academia may have taken her too far from the political fray. The Australian candidate – Mathias Cormann Cormann resigned as Australia’s longest-serving finance minister following his nomination to be OECD secretary general. A free market conservative with a reputation for defending Australia’s mining interests and denying climate change, he would appear to be out of step with a progressive institution. But his disavowal of “sceptical” comments on the environment are married to an aggressive attitude on Chinese expansion to make him a frontrunner with countries looking for a tough operator ready to take on Beijing. Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, is among those to be wooed by Cormann, who grew up and lived in Belgium until his early 20s, following a costly European trip last November. The Swedish candidate – Cecilia Malmström An EU commissioner looking for a fresh challenge after almost 10 years in Brussels, Malmström was looking almost perfectly positioned to become the OECD’s first female leader until a few months ago. A centre-right politician (which as a Swede makes her not very rightwing in global terms) known for her tough negotiating style and knowledge of international issues, she has all the connections and experience an OECD boss could need. Her stumbling block has been an abrasive relationship with many EU government leaders and the US during trade talks."
2021-02-15T00:01:03Z,business,Business,"Demand for detached houses rose in Covid lockdown, says Halifax","Demand for detached houses in the UK has boomed during the coronavirus pandemic, driving up prices three times faster than for flats as working from home boosted the popularity of bigger homes. Buyers paid an average price of £486,595 for a detached property in December – 10% more than in December 2019, according to the mortgage lender Halifax. The 10% increase for detached proprieties far outstrips those seen for othertypes of homes, as a rise in remote working – with a return to offices postponed until the summer – prompts growing numbers of people to move to bigger homes in leafier locations. Home movers had to pay an extra £200,000 to move up from a semi-detached property, which cost an average of £287,313 in December, a rise of as much as 6.3% from a year earlier.
Terrace houses were also in demand, with values rising 5.8% to £202,540. Flats recorded the smallest increase, of 3.2%, to an average price of £146,717. Over the six months to December, the average UK house price has risen by 6.3%, the fastest growth rate since early 2007, immediately before the 2008 financial crisis, according to Halifax. The price of a detached home has trebled in the last two decades. Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax, said significant demand for bigger homes was making it tougher for those on the bottom of the property ladder to move to a larger house. : “The gaps between each rung of the housing ladder have widened significantly. Those who have been unable to take a step up the housing ladder in the last year or so may find it harder to trade up than ever before,” he said.
The housing market slowed at the start of the year amid the third coronavirus lockdown, according to Halifax and surveys from other property industry experts including Nationwide and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The government’s stamp duty holiday on property purchases up to £500,000, viewed among key reasons for a boom in house prices last year, is due to expire at the end of March. Michelle Gallagher, sales director at JDG estate agents in Lancaster, said: “Buyer demand is up, fuelled by the need for more space as more people are having to work from home. For many, homes are shrinking with the kids being home due to home schooling. The problem now is the lack of supply, and as such we’re seeing inflated asking prices on some properties.”"
2021-02-14T15:21:16Z,business,Business,Arcadia assets sale gives hope to thousands of pension savers,"Thousands of workers saving pensions at Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group have been offered fresh hope they will recover more from their savings than feared following the sale of property assets at the tycoon’s collapsed company. Sources said the Arcadia scheme is on course to remain independent of the pensions lifeboat – which protects people with a defined benefit pension when an employer becomes insolvent, but at a reduced level – after trustees said they had realised £173m via the sale of assets since the company failed. The proceeds are understood to stem from the sale of Arcadia’s Topshop brand to Asos by administrators and a number of property sales. Arcadia’s pension scheme was given security over £210m of assets including the proceeds of the sale of Topshop or its London flagship store as well as other assets under a deal between the Green family, the trustees and the pensions regulator. Further sums are expected to be realised for the pension scheme, according to a letter to members first reported by the Sunday Telegraph. However, it is thought unlikely the amount raised will be enough to completely wipe out the scheme’s deficit, which is still being assessed by trustees. The deficit is estimated to stand at about £300m. That hole remains after the Green family paid £50m in cash into the scheme in December, on top of £50m paid under the deal cut with regulators at the time of company restructure in 2019. The scheme is being assessed by the Pensions Protection Fund (PPF) – the industry lifeboat scheme – after Arcadia fell into administration in November. Sources said it now appeared likely that sufficient funds would be realised from administrators’ sale of Arcadia’s assets so that the scheme would be able to be independent of the industry-funded lifeboat. That would be good news for Arcadia pensions savers as the PPF pays out only 90% of that owed to savers who have not reached retirement age – up to a cap of £41,461. If the scheme can be sold on to an insurance fund, it is likely that scheme members will receive more, although they are unlikely to receive their full pension. Those already past retirement age receive the full amount. A spokesman for the Arcadia trustees said: “Based on initial calculations, the trustees are optimistic that they will be able to secure benefits at above PPF levels and, therefore, the schemes should not need to remain in PPF assessment in the long-term. “The schemes have already received £173m as a result of the security package agreed under the terms of the 2019 CVA. This sum will be augmented by the additional payments the trustees expect to receive under the administration process, which will further increase the schemes’ likelihood of being able to secure benefits for members in excess of PPF compensation levels outside the PPF.”"
2021-02-14T14:46:04Z,business,Business,UK airlines warn of job losses as they lose business to Brexit,"British cargo, charter and leasing airlines say they are losing contracts and business to EU rivals after the Brexit deal failed to ensure a promised level playing field. The carriers say they are severely disadvantaged under the new post-Brexit regime because the rules and practices Britain has unilaterally adopted allow greater freedom and flexibility for EU-owned airlines to fly in the UK than UK carriers have in Europe. Permits are now required for foreign carriers to fly ad hoc flights between the UK and mainland Europe, which EU airlines have been able to obtain faster than British rivals and therefore are winning more business. The impact is being felt by small UK airlines that provide back-up passenger services and cargo flights at short notice, with the firms involved warning that the Brexit discrepancies could put them out of business. At least five of the carriers – Titan Airways, Jota Aviation, Loganair, CargoLogicAir and Air Tanker – are set to join forces with the planned launch of a campaign to save UK aviation jobs, which will demand reciprocal rights for UK airlines. Alistair Wilson, the managing director of Titan, said the detail of the deal meant UK carriers faced greater restrictions providing aircraft and crew for other airlines, known as wet-leasing. EU carriers can operate most wet-lease flights in the UK under the system, while UK operators say they are only able to do so now in exceptional circumstances in the EU. “This is an area of business many UK carriers and UK aviation jobs rely on,” Wilson said. “We lost a contract we had operated for the past 12 months requiring a UK-based aircraft and crew to fly cargo between the UK and Germany. The airline was forced to wet-lease from an EU carrier, even though the contract required UK-based aircraft, crew and engineers. This is EU law still presiding over business based in the UK.” A “non-objection” process also operates in some EU countries but not in the UK, where foreign carriers can only obtain permits for work if no domestic airline objects. That is allowing EU airlines to block permits for UK carriers to operate flights in and out of EU member states, the airlines say. Wilson said the group did not want to see trade restricted or flights cancelled but warned that unless market access was reciprocal, “hundreds of UK aviation jobs, many of which the government has spent the last year supporting through furlough, will be lost to the continent”. The airlines’ work includes flying time-critical cargo for factory supply chains, including the UK automotive and pharmaceutical industries. The importance of such immediate response was highlighted recently when Jaguar Land Rover had to halt production due to a missed delivery of parts. Andrew Green, the chief executive of Jota, which provides wet-lease for BA’s City Flyer service from London City airport, as well as cargo services, said airlines had been in discussion since 2016 with the Department for Transport highlighting concerns, but added: “They’ve negotiated a bad deal and the implementation and advice to industry has been poor.” According to Green, UK airlines are losing business as EU countries’ regulators can take two to three business days to issue them a permit, while EU carriers can obtain permits from the UK’s CAA within hours. He said: “Our clients understand that the UK issues permits quickly. We missed out on business to a Ukrainian Antonov 12 – an old cold war transport aeroplane – to fly car parts from the UK to Germany. The customer thought it was easier to do that than wait for us to get a permit.” He added: “The permit system needs to be relaxed – or if there is protectionism in the EU, it needs to be reciprocal. “This is going to destroy UK aviation … We are going to end up with a situation where one of the most connected places on earth is reliant on foreign carriers.”
The government is understood to be working with the industry and EU states to press for permits for ad-hoc services to be issued faster. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “The free trade agreement that we have agreed with the EU preserves the flexible working practices that are critical to operating the UK aviation industry. “We are actively supporting all UK airlines and leading engagement with EU member states to ensure UK airlines can operate to the EU with minimum administrative requirements.”"
2021-02-14T14:46:01Z,business,Business,Investment manager Neil Woodford to set up new firm,"Neil Woodford has announced plans for a new investment business and issued a public apology over the implosion of his last venture less than two years ago following a string of bets that went wrong. In one of the most dramatic attempts at a boardroom comeback in recent history, the former star fund manager said he planned to open a new firm – WCM Partners – which would be based in Jersey and Buckinghamshire. Unlike his previous vehicle, which lost thousands of pounds of investors’ money and was forced into liquidation in 2019, the new firm will focus on advising professional investors rather than retail customers. Setting out his plans after more than a year of public silence, Woodford used an interview in the Sunday Telegraph to say he was “very sorry for what I did wrong” at the helm of the Woodford Equity Income Fund. But he rejected criticism of his management style and argued that he could have saved investors money if the fund had not been forced to close. The new firm will draw fees for advising on biotechnology assets Woodford originally bought before the collapse. They are now owned by Acacia, a New York-listed company that bought the shares last year and which intends to use them as the foundation on which to rebuild the Woodford investing operation. The Woodford Equity Income Fund collapsed in October 2019 following months of turmoil when investments did not perform as hoped. Woodford was removed as investment manager and its administrator, Link Fund Solutions, wound it down, returning money to many investors at a steep loss. Woodford’s planned return is likely to raise eyebrows as it comes at a time when an investigation into the collapse of the equity income fund has yet to be published by the Financial Conduct Authority. A spokesperson for the City regulator declined to comment. Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at the fund management firm AJ Bell, said about £200m of money was still stuck in previous funds and that many investors were sitting on losses of more than 25%. “The news that Neil Woodford is looking to make a comeback will come as a surprise to many, especially those thousands of embattled investors who are still waiting to get the last of their money back. “There will be little sympathy for Woodford and the comments he made in his recent interview.” Woodford, who earned dividends worth millions of pounds from the firm shortly before its collapse, said he had been forced to sell his main home, a farm in the Cotswolds worth £30m, in the aftermath of the closure. The fund manager had risen to become one of Britain’s most prominent investors in recent decades, earning the moniker “the oracle of Oxford” after 25 years at Invesco Perpetual. Strong returns had garnered him a significant following among retail investors and savers, allowing him to start his own investment business in 2014, with assets worth £16bn under his control by 2017. But by October 2019 the assets in his main fund had fallen to £3.1bn following lacklustre performance and as big pension funds lost confidence and withdrew their money. Some investments included stakes in poorly performing companies such as scandal-hit Provident Financial, a high-cost lender targeting poorer customers, the estate agent Purplebricks, and the litigation finance firm Burford Capital. He also chose to invest in frontier technology companies with unproven revenue prospects, including a highly speculative venture trying to pioneer nuclear fusion at low temperatures and a series of biotechnology companies. Furthermore, he faced criticism for investing in private, unlisted companies, which made it difficult to sell them when some clients withdrew their money. “I’m very sorry for what I did wrong,” he said. “What I was responsible for was two years of underperformance – I was the fund manager, the investment strategy was mine, I owned it, and it delivered a period of underperformance.” Woodford also criticised Link Fund Solutions, however, which suspended the funds he ran and then decided to wind down the funds, saying this was “incredibly damaging to investors” because they forced it into a fire sale of assets below what he believed was their true value. A spokeswoman for Link said the decision to wind up the fund “was considered to be in the best interests of all investors”. Woodford said that if he were to return to running retail money, he would not stray far from large listed companies whose shares could be easily sold to meet investor redemptions. Although saying that he did not want the 2019 collapse to be the “epitaph” of his career, he added: “You can imagine lots of people who have read the media about me wouldn’t want to touch me with a 10-foot disinfected bargepole.”"
2021-02-14T12:44:23Z,business,Business,Open sesame: Alibaba's push into Europe a mixed blessing for Liège  ,"Braving an ominously grey sky, Ine Brants, 33, perches precariously at the top of a stepladder at Liège airport’s perimeter fence. “Ah, the green queen,” she says, raising the long lens of her camera to Challenge Airlines’ green-liveried jumbo jet as it flies into view. “You can get a 747 rush hour here. It has definitely got busier since coronavirus.” Brants’ lens is capturing the Alibaba effect. Quietly over the last three years, Liège, Belgium’s third largest city, has been transformed into a launchpad for the Chinese e-commerce group’s push into the European marketplace, a dynamic boosted by the coronavirus pandemic. It is a cause for celebration for some and worry for others. There is no trace of Alibaba branding at the airport, from the empty passenger arrival and departure halls shut owing to the health crisis, to the loose-gravelled lorry park where Brants and other plane spotters shuffle in the cold. But follow the perimeter fence around the two runways, past the vast orange TNT warehouses and customs offices and on to the south side, where the airport meets the little village of Velroux, and there, in front of a some tall heaps of sandy soil and pallets of corrugated iron, is a sign bearing an architect’s drawing of a large grey building and the words “Alibaba Smart Hub Belgium”. The Chinese are coming. By the summer, this muddy plot in the Francophone municipality of Grâce-Hollogne in south-east Belgium will boast a cargo building covering 33,000 sq metres (355,209 sq ft) as part of a €300m (£262m) investment by the Alibaba subsidiary Cainiao Smart Logistics Network. Alibaba has also established in partnership with the company ZIH a rail link between here and Zhengzhou in central China, connecting two cities nearly 5,600 miles (9,000km) apart, twice a week. Local logistics companies are being recruited to move the goods onwards.
The development promises a new chapter for this once proud steel-producing area as Alibaba’s European hub, handling more than 80% of parcels purchased through its international online platform AliExpress, a kind of broker that allows businesses around the world to offer their services through one website. Liège is the frontline of a push into Europe that seeks to challenge Amazon in one of the world’s wealthiest markets and provide a whole new array of services not offered by Alibaba’s US rival. Deliveries from China first started arriving in large numbers after the Belgian state deployed the services of King Philippe to encourage Alibaba’s co-founder Jack Ma to choose Liège as its European base during multiple royal audiences in 2018.
But Michel Kempeneers, of the Wallonia Export Investment Agency, said the pandemic had since triggered an “enormous leap in the awareness of [Belgium] shopkeepers” about the opportunity to sell goods to the Chinese market through Alibaba. “A leap of five years in five weeks, some experts say,” headded. In turn there has been a notable surge in deliveries arriving in Liège from Chinese sellers. During Alibaba’s Double 11 shopping festival in November – an online promotion month much like Black Friday – record amounts were flown in. “On average there were two to three cargo flights arriving in Liège from 13 November to 6 December, which represent an estimated 200-300 tonnes of cargo each day during those days,” Kempeneers said. The number of packages transported via Liège airport has increased from 9m in 2018 to more than 500m last year. Beyond the impact of the global increase in online shopping during the crisis, the airport, which operates 24/7, has benefited in recent months from the rising cost of transporting goods by sea from Asia, said Tiffany Lung, an independent retail analyst based in Hong Kong. A lack of empty containers available in China – many were left stranded in Europe and the US when shipping lanes cancelled trips at the start of the pandemic – has quadrupled prices on sea trade routes to Europe. “Speed within the western region is the only thing Amazon has an upper hand with against Alibaba, but this is also why Alibaba has been strenuously investing in building up a global logistics hub,” Lung said. “Supposedly with their new freight route, items from China can arrive in Europe quickest within three days, cutting the industry average by a third.” And yet far from everyone is happy. “There is already deafening noise,” said François Schreuer, a councillor for the local Green party in Liège and a founding member of the Watching Alibaba campaign group. For all that Alibaba is offering jobs, a series of protests have been staged over the last 18 months in Liège’s city centre. Some of the complaints – about air pollution, the clogging up of the arterial roads and night-time flyovers – are perhaps predictable. But there is also a deeper anxiety voiced about the city’s future.
Too much reliance is being put on Alibaba to revive the fortunes of the region, which has struggled to find a new way since the collapse of heavy industry in the 1960s, those behind Watching Alibaba say. “Logistics is becoming a new monoculture,” said Schreuer. FedEx announced last month it was initiating a collective dismissal procedure with regard to nearly 700 workers at Liège airport as it wished to move operations to Paris. It has been suggested that the logistics company was upset by Alibaba’s move, a claim denied. But for many, it remains a sign that the region is putting too much reliance on foreign companies that have little local attachment.
“This episode sadly confirms what we have been repeating for years: we cannot build, in the long term, the development of a region on an economic sector as little anchored locally, as easily delocalised, as international logistics,” said Watching Alibaba. Alibaba reported record revenues last quarter of £24.6bn – up 37% year on year. But Ma’s three-month disappearance after criticising the Chinese Communist party has raised fresh concerns over whether Alibaba is truly to be banked upon. Kempeneers concedes there is no certainty that Alibaba’s push into Europe will be a success. He points to the 9,000 jobs at the airport and the deployment of local companies to move the goods onwards. But it is yet to be seen whether Europeans want to buy Chinese brands in sufficient numbers. According to the lobby group Ecommerce Europe, AliExpress has just 2% to 5% of the e-commerce traffic in Europe. “The project in Liège will depend, as with any logistics activity, on market developments and of course on the consumers,” Kempeneers said. Climbing down from her stepladder, Brants, who lost her job during the pandemic, says she backs anything that will bring work to the area. But there is a word of warning about the challenge. “I buy stuff on Alibaba from time to time – it could be quicker,” she said. Liège’s future perhaps depends on it."
2021-02-14T12:00:41Z,business,Business,A mask-free supermarket has made news – but it's publicity you can live without | Gene Marks,"Have you seen the video yet? It’s pretty shocking. No, it’s not the Weeknd’s Super Bowl performance. It’s even worse. The 15-second video, from an NBC news reporter, shows shoppers and workers inside an independent Florida supermarket going about their business … maskless. The video was taken in early February 2021 right as the state continued to record thousands of new Covid cases and scores of deaths from the virus every day.
Still, the shoppers and employees – many of whom appear elderly, which would make them a high-risk group – are defiant, with the New York Post reporting that “one maskless female employee is seen laughing at a customer who also eschewed donning a mask, while two workers and another patron were all without personal protective equipment at another checkout aisle.” Is this allowed? Well, yes and no. There is a mask mandate in the county where the supermarket is located. But it appears to be enforced leniently. And Alfie Oakes, the owner of the store and a fierce opponent of mask-wearing, has hung a sign stating that customers are “exempt” from the mask mandate “if they have a medical condition” and that “workers ‘will assume’ customers without masks have a medical condition making them exempt from the mandate.” The video is upsetting for a few reasons. Of course, the obvious is that so many older customers and employees are exposing themselves to the virus – and we all know it’s likely that most do not have any “medical conditions” that would preclude them from wearing a mask. It’s annoying that a small business owner is so blatantly flouting the rules. More upsetting is that – well, darn it – remember the good old days when we didn’t have to wear masks everywhere? Argh. So is Oakes wrong? Yes, he is very wrong. But not for legal reasons. What he’s doing is bad for his business. That’s because being on the wrong side of a topical issue is never good for a small business. If you’re that bakery that refuses to sell a wedding cake to an LGBT couple or a restaurant that denies entry to a politician opposed by the owner or a fitness center that adamantly stays open during a shutdown and in the face of government fines you’re ultimately going to lose that battle. Sure, you’ll have some supporters. But the negative response on social media and its resulting undesirable PR, combined with the fines, the legal problems and most importantly the ire you’ll probably raise among the rest of your community will ultimately drive away most others. Alfie Oakes has his principles and that’s his right. But his principles clearly go well beyond what’s good for his community. He could easily continue to operate his business while still requiring a mask. It’s really not that big a deal. He could hang a sign that says something like “this mask rule is crazy and I oppose it but still … please put one on.” But by not doing so, he’s not only putting his employees and customers at risk, he’s putting his company’s long-term prospects at risk. He’s losing many customers right now who fear entering his store or who are disgusted by his behavior and it’s likely many of them won’t come back once they get a taste of the competition. More importantly, he’s losing his credibility and respect with many in the community. And that’s something no business owner should be without. So go ahead, be political in your personal life. But don’t do what Oakes is doing. Keep your business out of politics. Otherwise you’ll risk putting your business – and all the people who rely on it for their livelihoods – in jeopardy."
2021-02-14T11:15:24Z,business,Business,Covid is forcing economists to look at other disciplines for recovery clues | Larry Elliott,"Three times a week an update on new Covid-19 cases is published by the economics consultancy Pantheon. Vaccination rates are monitored by the Swiss bank UBS. The scientists advising the government are in regular contact with the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee – the body that sets interest rates. Richard Nixon may or may not have said “we are all Keynesians now” after the US broke its link with gold in 1971 but one thing is for sure: all economists are epidemiologists now. And there’s a downside and an upside to that. The downside is that economic forecasting is even more of a mug’s game than usual because even the real (as opposed to the amateur) epidemiologists don’t really know what is going to happen next. Are there going to be new mutations of the virus? Assuming there are, will they be less susceptible to vaccines? Will Covid-19 go away in the summer only to return again as the days get shorter, as happened last year? Nobody really knows the answers to those questions. The upside is that the pandemic has forced economists to look beyond their mechanical models and embrace thinking from other disciplines, of which epidemiology is just one. For a start, it is hard to estimate how people are going to react to the easing of lockdown restrictions without some help from psychologists. It is possible that there will be an explosion of spending as consumers, in the words of Andrew Bailey, “go for it”, but it is also possible that the second wave of infection will make them a lot more cautious than they were last summer, when there was still hope that Covid-19 was a fleeting phenomenon. An individual’s behaviour is also not entirely driven by their own economic circumstances. It can be strongly affected by what others are doing. If your peer group decides after having the vaccine that it is safe to go to the pub, that will probably affect your decision about whether to join your mates for a drink, even if you are slightly nervous. Sociology has a part to play in economic forecasting. As does history, if only to a limited extent, because there are not a lot of comparable episodes to draw upon. A century has passed since the last truly global pandemic and there is only so much that can be learned from the outbreak of Spanish flu after the first world war. But when Andy Haldane, the chief economist of the Bank of England, says the economy is like a coiled spring waiting to be unleashed, that’s because he thinks there are lessons to be learned from the rapid recovery seen last summer. Back then, the economy followed a near-19% collapse in the second quarter of 2020 with a 16% jump in the third quarter. Naturally, economics has a part to play in judging what happens next. Millions of people (mostly the better off) have remained in work on full pay for the past year but have struggled to find anything to spend their money on. Millions of others – those furloughed on 80% of their normal wages or self-employed people who have slipped through the Treasury’s safety net – are less well-off than they were a year ago and may fear for their job prospects. In an ideal world, the better-off would decide that the amount of money saved during lockdown was far in excess of what they needed and would then go on a spending spree: heading out for meals, taking weekend breaks, buying new cars; having their homes redecorated. That would provide jobs and incomes for those on lower incomes. But it might not work out like that. If the better-off leave their accumulated savings (or most of them, at least) in the bank, that means higher unemployment for those working in consumer-facing services jobs – such as hotels and restaurants – and an economy with a dose of long Covid. There are two conclusions to be drawn from all of this. The first is that precise forecasts of what is going to happen to the economy over the next year, or even the next few months, should be treated with caution. Assuming the vaccination programme continues to go well, assuming that there are no further waves of infection, assuming restrictions are lifted steadily from early March onwards, and assuming that people come out of hibernation rapidly and in numbers, then the economy will start to recover in the second quarter. But there are a heck of a lot of assumptions in there: it might take until the third quarter for the bounce-back to begin; the recovery might prove weaker or stronger than the consensus currently expects. The second conclusion is equally obvious. If, as is clearly the case, the existence of so many imponderables makes precision forecasting more difficult than normal, it makes sense for economic policy makers to act with caution. For the Bank of England, that means no dash to embrace negative interest rates, which won’t be necessary if Haldane’s bullishness proves to be justified; and for the Treasury it means extending financial support and ignoring calls for higher taxes, especially those that might lead businesses to collapse or cut back on investment. It would appear that Rishi Sunak has reached the same conclusion. There has been far less talk from the chancellor recently about the need to reduce the UK’s budget deficit, a process that has now been delayed until the second budget of 2021 in the autumn. By that stage, it might well once again be Sunak rather than the epidemiologists running the economy. Well, perhaps."
2021-02-14T10:45:09Z,business,Business,Ex-Persimmon chief fails to set up charity three years on from bonus row,"Jeff Fairburn, the former chief executive of the housebuilder Persimmon, has failed to set up a charity three years after pledging to do so in an attempt to assuage public and political anger at his £82m bonus. Fairburn has not registered a charity with the Charity Commission or made any inquiries about how to set one up, after he said on 14 February 2018 he would donate a “substantial proportion” of his bonus to a charitable trust. The furore over the payout, believed to be one of the most generous in the FTSE 100 at the time, led to the chief executive losing his job later that year after the company said it was having a negative impact on the reputation of the business. The controversial bonus payment resulted from a scheme linked to the housebuilder’s share price, which soared thanks to the government’s help-to-buy programme. About half of Persimmon’s homes are bought with its assistance. Fairburn is also not named as a trustee of any charity in England or Wales. It is not known whether he has donated to any separate existing charity. He did not respond to repeated requests for comment, nor did several of his colleagues at the housebuilding company. The revelation that Fairburn appears not to have set up a foundation to donate any of his bonus comes days after his former company set aside £75m to pay for work needed to remove flammable cladding on its high-rise buildings following the Grenfell Tower fire. An independent review in 2019 had found that Persimmon had built homes so shoddily that it left its customers exposed to an “intolerable risk” in the event of fire. Garry White, chief investment commentator at investment firm Charles Stanley, said: “Jeff Fairburn won the equivalent of an LTIP [long-term incentive plan] lottery. The ticket was handed to him by [former chancellor] George Osborne, but was bought for him by Britain’s taxpayers. “About half the company’s houses are sold via the government-backed help-to-buy scheme and the debacle demonstrates why LTIPs are a poor way to reward company executives. Share price moves can be gamed by corporate action such as share buybacks and the imperfect system introduced by Persimmon has given the impression of corporate looting. All such schemes should have an upper limit.” While Fairburn appears not to have set up the promised charity, he has re-entered the housebuilding market after buying a 50% stake in Yorkshire house builder Berkeley DeVeer and becoming its chief executive. In a press release announcing his investment in Berkeley DeVeer last year, Fairburn said: “I’m honoured to join the company as CEO, and to have become a significant investor.” A Charity Commission spokeswoman said: “We have no record of a registered charity bearing Jeff Fairburn’s name. Nor does it appear Mr Fairburn is a current trustee of an active charity. We can’t categorically state that no charity has been registered that involves Mr Fairburn in some capacity. It would also not be possible for us to confirm whether or not any funds have been donated via another charity.” Luke Hildyard, the executive director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, said: “When this obviously excessive and unearned payment was first made, the promise that a substantial portion would be used to set up a charity enabled Persimmon to draw a line under the affair. So there is a moral onus on Fairburn to provide some transparency over the matter. “Charitable giving by the super-rich is claimed to be an example of the so-called ‘trickle-down’ effect but as this case suggests, philanthropy can be highly whimsical, opaque and unaccountable. The benefits it provides for wider society are minimal compared to proper taxation of extreme wealth.”"
2021-02-14T10:30:39Z,business,Business,"Brexit: as half its sales are wiped out, silk firm joins exodus to Europe","Mike Bennett runs a small firm called Bennett Silks in Stockport, Greater Manchester, which has been in his family since his great-grandfather set it up in 1904. The company employs 15 people, and has, in normal times, an annual turnover of about £2.5m. It operates in what Bennett describes as “a niche market at the top end of fashion”. The silk is produced in a region of China that has precisely the right climate for the mulberry tree to prosper. Silk worms feed on mulberry leaves. The company imports the silk, then sells to a wide range of industries, from the makers of wedding dresses to film-makers, theatres, high-end boutiques, firms that manufacture clothes for jockeys to wear at race meetings, and people who want special garments made for parties. Covid-19 was a disaster for sales, but then came Brexit. “Having spent the last 25 years developing a successful sales operation throughout the EU, which until recently accounted for about 50% of our sales, we are now facing the prospect of our EU business being wiped out due to the complications of the Brexit deal,” says Bennett. “Feedback from our clients on the continent is that they will not accept the extra customs charges and duties, and will simply switch to our competitors who remain in the EU. Who can blame them? I would do the same.” Like many other UK small businesses – the British Chambers of Commerce said last week that half of small businesses that export to the EU from the UK were struggling with Brexit rules, regulations and costs – Bennett says he has no option but to shift part of his company from Stockport to France, so it is back inside the EU’s single market. “Our only chance to retain EU business is to create a distribution centre in France,” he said. This, unfortunately, will have the effect of taking jobs and economic activity away from north-west England. Luckily, back in 2016 Bennett took a majority shareholding in a French weaving factory based between Lyon and Roanne, and which still has spare space. To help cover his costs Bennett will offer joint use of the facility to other UK companies with similar problems. “There must be thousands of companies in exactly the same situation. If they all reduce their UK staff by one-third, the consequences to the UK economy will be massive,” he says. Already the authorities in the Netherlands and Austria are luring hundreds of UK companies into their territories and tax jurisdictions as UK exporters struggle. And now, so too are the French. Artus Galiay, the representative to the UK for the Hauts-de-France region that extends from the outskirts of Paris to Calais and Dunkirk, says the regional council there is not trying to act as a parasite on the UK’s post-Brexit economy – but to help. He is, however, keen to sell what the region offers, and delights in historical allusions. Hauts-de-France offers industrial and logistics sites, what he calls “a dynamic commercial real estate market with competitive costs”, as well as lawyers and accountants. It also wants a chance to repay past generosity. “We are here to strengthen relations that are centuries old,” says Galiay. “History fans will remember that around 500 years ago, in 1520, it was Henry VIII who welcomed his rival French King François I at the Field of the Cloth of Gold near Calais, at a time when the city was English. Five hundred years later, we are here to return that favour.” Bennett, meanwhile, is glad that after a dismal period, his French investment will help Bennett Silks in a way he had not expected. But he still can’t believe the unnecessary problems that have been put in exporters’ ways. He ridicules the idea that other trade deals with far-off countries will replace being members of the EU single market. “To turn our backs on the world’s largest trading bloc, which is on our doorstep, in favour of trying to create trade deals with countries that couldn’t be further away, and have much smaller economies, is total stupidity and beyond comprehension,” he says. “Covid has kept the Brexit issues out of the headlines, but to try and get a message across to our single- minded, short-sighted government, it needs to be in the headlines. I cannot think of one single positive benefit from Brexit, only negatives, and all my customers and contacts are of the same opinion. “Britain used to be great but no longer,” he says, blaming Tory politicians at the top of government. “To adapt a phrase from our most famous leader, ‘Never in the field of British business has so much been destroyed for so many, by so few.’”"
2021-02-14T09:00:37Z,business,Business,London's bridges are falling down: how politics has failed the capital's crossings,"Toby Gordon-Smith can see the district of Hammersmith from his flat. In normal times it takes him a few minutes to get there in his wheelchair. His cannabidiol products business is there, with the accessible tube station that he needs to get to the rest of London. The station is the reason why he moved to the area, but now it might as well be in another city. For he lives in Barnes, on the south side of the River Thames, opposite Hammersmith, and the bridge that connected them is closed for safety reasons – to vehicles since April 2019, and to pedestrians, cyclists and wheelchair users since last August. Although it is nearly two years since the first closure, there is still no clear plan for fixing the bridge. There are thousands of stories like Gordon-Smith’s. For children in Barnes who go to schools in Hammersmith, what was once a 15-minute walk is now a tortuous three-mile journey along a towpath regularly flooded by the tide, up flights of steps on to a railway bridge (which makes cycling difficult) and through an ill-lit park with high rates of crime. Or they can take a long bus ride, which means getting up at 6am, if you’re going to beat the rush-hour traffic. The area’s main hospital, Charing Cross, is on the north side of the river, so those of its staff who live to the south, and patients needing such things as chemotherapy, now have to make gruelling journeys of an hour or more each way. Ambulances face potentially lethal delays. It is as if a town has had a limb sawn off. Things formerly taken for granted – going to shops, restaurants, GPs’ clinics, meeting friends and family – are now inaccessible. “We used to go there three or four times a week,” says Muriel Seaman, who is “92 coming up to 93”, and who lives with her 96-year-old husband Joe in Barnes. “A little outing on the bus, a little trip out, nothing special, but it gave a different outlook.” They had to change their doctor of 40 years. “It was hurtful, sad, it made me cry. When you get older you rely on things that have been happening all the time.” Lockdown, for now, makes some of these difficulties moot, although in some cases it compounds them. Shops and pubs that have just about coped with Covid, for example, are doubly hammered by the loss of passing trade. But however endless lockdown now seems, it is unlikely to match the six or more years that the bridge closure is projected to take. A pedestrian ferry is promised sooner than that, in spring or perhaps summer, but it will only be partial solution. It is hard to think of a London bridge whose closure would be more damaging, as Barnes has no tube station, and the nearest alternatives (for vehicles) are about two miles away in either direction. The effects on bus and car traffic are felt across much of west London.
It’s obvious who to blame: politicians are guilty to varying degrees of buck-passing, posturing, point-scoring, broken promises and inaction. The problem is that they are in different parties and different authorities. The main players are the now Labour-run borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, the Tory national government, London’s Labour mayoralty, and the borough of Richmond, which is run by the Liberal Democrats. As Professor Tony Travers of the London School of Economics has said, the Hammersmith Bridge saga is a failure of political as well as structural engineering. And, if this bridge story sounds like a little local difficulty, it is not. There are other bridges with similar problems – messy politics, decaying structures – and failing infrastructure is a national issue. The Times has reported that “4,000 of about 9,000 bridges and large culverts on motorways or A-roads showed evidence of defects or damage that may significantly affect capacity” and that “the RAC estimates that there are more than 3,000 substandard road bridges across Britain that are not capable of supporting the heaviest vehicles”. It is a poor portent if every cracking structure is dealt with as ineptly as at Hammersmith. The current bridge, painted in sage green and touches of gold, has something of the fairground about it – turrets, finials, heraldic emblems, sculpted scrolls and foliage. It was installed in 1887 by London’s Metropolitan Board of Works under the leadership of Joseph Bazalgette, the organisation and the individual who had rescued the capital from cholera epidemics by installing an effective sewage system. It replaced an older bridge of 1827, financed by charging tolls, which was no longer strong enough for the traffic passing over it. There were also concerns about the effects of the crowds that clambered over it to watch the annual Oxford and Cambridge boat race.
Bazalgette’s bridge was built of iron, with the deck suspended by chains hung from two pairs of pillars, technology that would soon be made obsolete by the development of steel cables. Time would not be kind to it. It was subjected to three bombing attempts by different versions of the IRA, in 1939, 1996 and 2000, not all which succeeded. The last one did, which led to a two-year closure for repairs. The bridge required significant renovations in 1973 and 1997, in part to deal with the weight of motorised vehicles on a structure designed for horse-drawn traffic. Perhaps its greatest misfortune came in 1986, with Margaret Thatcher’s abolition of the Greater London Council, whose properties were dispersed to London boroughs. These included Hammersmith Bridge, which was passed to the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, for whom it was nothing but a liability. The decision was stranger for the fact that the bridge is much more important for people south of the river, in the borough of Richmond, than it is for Hammersmith. It was therefore in the care of an authority with limited electoral motivation for looking after it. In April 2019 it was closed indefinitely to motor vehicles after cracks were spotted in the cast-iron pedestals through which the suspension structure is tied back to the ground. In August 2020 the engineering firm Mott MacDonald, which is working for Hammersmith and Fulham, found that the cracks had widened, possibly due to an intense heatwave. The bridge was closed to pedestrians and cyclists, and river traffic – which will include the hallowed boat race – was forbidden from passing underneath, decisions that other experts have since called “overly cautious”. Mott MacDonald, though, stands by it. The estimated bill would be £141m for a full repair, £163m if that repair were fast-tracked, or £48m just to make it safe for pedestrians, cyclists and river traffic. The fact that the bridge is listed for its historic and architectural interest, and therefore has to be preserved, makes the remedies all the more difficult, costly and slow.
At this point the arcane details of ownership and responsibility became life-changing for thousands of people. The strokes of the bureaucrat’s typewriter that consigned the bridge to Hammersmith and Fulham have proved more effective than the IRA at snarling up this part of London. Hammersmith and Fulham council, the owner, announced that it couldn’t pay. “No council has that sort of money available,” it said. Last December, when told by the Department for Transport that it would have to stump up at least £63m for the renovation, the council’s leader, Stephen Cowan, called it a “cruel, unusual and unprecedented punishment” for an authority whose annual budget is £140m. It believes that national government, in the form of the Department for Transport, should contribute funding, along with city-wide government, in the form of Transport for London and mayor Sadiq Khan. A blame game has broken out, amplified by the politics of 2019’s general election and the London mayoral election in May. No one wants to do anyone else any favours. Matters have been complicated by the government’s “levelling-up” agenda of diverting resources to more deprived parts of the country, which means not-London. It probably doesn’t help that Barnes, often prefixed by the epithet “leafy”, has a reputation for being posh, even though as in most of the capital there are council tenants and struggling private renters in among its £2m houses. “It feels as if London is being punished,” says Richmond’s Lib Dem leader, Gareth Roberts. Hammersmith and Fulham council is accused – by both the Department for Transport and the Lib Dem Richmond MP Sarah Olney, among others – of poor maintenance standards over decades of both Conservative and Labour administrations, for example by slapping on layers of paint that impeded the flexibility that structures like this need. The transport minister Charlotte Vere says that it’s “extremely regrettable that government had to step in. We expect local leadership with local assets.” She criticises Hammersmith and Fulham for “foot-dragging”. She points out that the borough refuses to release its engineers’ report in full, a position that she says is unhelpful and strange. Transport for London has so far put up £16.7m on urgent works and on the proposed ferry, but Khan, say local residents, has been insufficiently helpful. He could have done more, in their view, to bang heads together. “Some people are trying to play politics with this issue,” he wrote to them recently, “this letter is not an attempt to respond in kind.” He went on to do just that, blaming “ministers” for their inaction. The worst-affected borough, Richmond, while assisting with the ferry proposals, has largely stood by in relative impotence, as it lacks direct authority over the bridge.
The man at the top of this administrative pyramid, the transport secretary Grant Shapps, has seemed more interested in point-scoring than getting anything done. In December 2019, just before the general election, he was filmed next to the bridge, standing alongside Richmond’s incumbent Tory MP Zac Goldsmith. “Zac, if you’re re-elected,” he said, “if we get a Conservative majority… we are going to not stand by, we are going to get involved.” He promised to get a temporary structure “done quickly” and to “put some money in.” The Conservatives won nationally, Goldsmith lost locally, and the money and rapid action didn’t materialise. In September 2020 Shapps announced a “taskforce” for the bridge, chaired by Lady Vere, saying that he would “take control” and “get this sorted this out”, albeit without putting significant funding at its disposal. In October he appeared in front of a camera again, alongside the Conservative mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey. Residents were pleased, Bailey told Shapps, “that you’ve provided the money, that your department has provided the money, to repair the bridge in the long run, to get back to motorised traffic.” Nothing wrong with this statement, except that it wasn’t true – Shapps’s department had committed no such money and still has not, beyond £4m for emergency and temporary work provided after the interview with Bailey. There are, in all this, some glimmers of hope. The architects Foster and Partners and engineers COWI have proposed a temporary structure, a double-decker girder that could be inserted into the existing bridge. Cars would use the upper deck, pedestrians and cyclists the lower. It would also support the old bridge such that parts could be removed for repair, which would be easier than trying to fix them in their exposed location above the river. It would get the bridge working relatively quickly – less than a year for the construction of the temporary structure, though with several months more for getting approvals and appointing contractors. Hammersmith and Fulham council has commissioned a more detailed feasibility study of this scheme. It also now proposes that the funding gap can be covered by charging tolls to vehicles using the bridge, a proposal that until recently would have been greeted with outrage, not least because many of the bridge users will be heading to or from central London’s congestion charge zone, for which they will also have to pay. Drivers seeking to avoid the toll will put pressure on other river crossings. But at this point it looks like the least bad and most viable way of ending the impasse.
Elsewhere along the Thames, the Vauxhall and London bridges have had to close for repairs, the bascules of Tower Bridge recently jammed, and climate change and increasing traffic will put other ageing structures under pressure. As in Hammersmith there are byzantine arrangements of ownerships and responsibilities, with some owned by borough councils, some by Transport for London, and some by the 739-year-old Bridge House Estates. Unless saner arrangements are introduced, with realistic ideas about funding – and there is little sign of either – the Hammersmith Bridge fiasco will be one of many. And, while other parts of the country have different arrangements, infrastructure everywhere will require a greater degree of organisation and determination than has so far been seen. At the same time the Thames has been garlanded with non-essential proposals, most notably Boris Johnson’s failed Garden Bridge project, which cost £43m in public money not to happen, an amount which could have made a huge difference in Hammersmith. PR, evidently, is easier for modern governments than engineering. Which gives rise to ironies: one of the achievements of the Metropolitan Board of Works was to abolish tolls on Thames bridges, but it looks as if those will now come back. And the board was created in 1855 as an instrument of London-wide government, in order to overcome a dysfunctional mess of small local authorities that had stymied large-scale works. The gaggle of interested parties around Hammersmith Bridge is a step back to those bad old days. Meanwhile the residents of Barnes can only watch and wait, as their futures are held hostage in squabbles between different political entities. “Worse things happened during the war,” says Muriel Seaman, whose husband served in the navy, “and we just got on with it. But that was an enemy we could see. This is an enemy you can’t.”"
2021-02-14T00:05:26Z,business,Business,Barclays boss hopes to avoid more stormy weather,"Barclays will be hoping to avoid another bombshell announcement that could overshadow its full-year results, coming up this week, for a second year running. The British banking giant is expected to report a 36% drop in annual profits to £2.8bn, with earnings hit by bad debt provisions during a global pandemic. However, its spin doctors will find it much easier to control that narrative than another corporate scandal or investigation involving its chief executive, Jes Staley. Last year, a 25% jump in earnings was easily eclipsed by news that the Financial Conduct Authority was investigating the way Staley had portrayed his ties to the sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. That morning, not a single question was asked about Barclays’ results on its media call, which ran for less time than normal. While the FCA is rarely quick to release judgments, it has been more than a year since its inquiry was launched, leaving Barclays and Staley waiting for the other shoe to drop. In the meantime, Staley’s team will be parading strong profits from their corporate and investment bank (CIB) when they release results on Thursday, thanks to a jump in trading due to market volatility, and a rebound in corporate mergers and acquisitions at the end of 2020. According to consensus estimates, the CIB is expected to report a 20% rise in profits to £3.6bn, compared with £3bn for 2019. It will not only help cushion the blow of putting aside more than £5bn to help cover a potential surge in defaults linked to Covid-19 for 2020, but also keep the activist investor Edward Bramson at bay.
Bramson’s investment vehicle, Sherborne, which has a 5.9% holding in the bank, has been nipping at Barclays’s heels since 2018, arguing that it should scale down the investment bank to focus on its consumer operations, and oust Staley over the Epstein investigation. Bramson temporarily backed down during the Covid crisis. But with the UK’s vaccine programme gaining pace, Sherborne could re-emerge with force. Staley has dug his heels in, confirming in October that he hoped to stay on for “another couple of years”. After completing a major restructuring of the bank and dealing with Brexit and the pandemic, he said: “It’d be nice to be here through more kinder winds.” A longer tenure could also mean a rebound in Staley’s pay package. Barclays’s annual report, due alongside its full-year earnings, is expected to show a drop in Staley’s pay after he donated £392,000 of his own income to the bank’s coronavirus fund. That donation would shave only 6.6% off the £5.9m Staley earned in 2019, which included a bonus of £1.7m. He is still likely to be the UK’s highest-paid banking chief, given that other bosses, like NatWest’s Alison Rose and Lloyds’s António Horta-Osório, have waived their bonuses. Barclays traders, meanwhile, are reportedly set to see their bonus pool rise by 10%, according to Bloomberg. But any increase will be scrutinised by the Bank of England, which warned in December that it would keep a close eye on cash bonuses for senior staff, given the uncertain economic outlook. And while the central bank lifted a ban on dividends, Barclays shareholders – including Bramson – will see their 2020 payouts capped at either 25% of profits over 2019 and 2020 combined, excluding previous dividend payments, or 0.2% of the value of their riskiest assets, whichever is highest. But with shares down roughly 20% compared to the start of the crisis, at about 147p, shareholders are also likely to hold on for kinder winds."
2021-02-13T19:00:22Z,business,Business,The government is stuck in the fallacy of debt and deficit while ignoring the climate crisis | Greg Jericho,"Despite a year in which there was a massive increase in government debt that had no discernible impact on interest rates or inflation, our politics remains stuck in the fallacy of debt and deficit, even in the face of the great crisis of climate change. One of economist John Maynard Keynes’ most repeated aphorisms is “when the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” There is no evidence he ever said such a thing, which is just as well because while many utter the line, few follow through. Usually, the change of mind is brief, until the facts can once again be dismissed.
For all of my lifetime, the Liberal party has sowed fear of government debt and budget deficits because they said it would increase inflation and interest rates. In 2010 Mathias Cormann told parliament that GFC stimulus “has delivered record levels of debt and record levels of deficit and which has been putting upward pressure on interest rates and inflation”. At that time the cash rate was 4.75%. Since then government net debt has gone from 3.7% of GDP to 34% and yet the cash rate is now 0.1%. But hey, “facts”. Then when the pandemic hit, the facts changed and so did their minds. Last year, Cormann responded to questions about the massive increase in the budget deficit by saying “what is the alternative? Are you suggesting that we should not have provided the support we did to boost our health system, to protect jobs, to protect livelihoods? I mean, in the circumstances what was the alternative.” It was a good answer and remains so even though this week the parliamentary budget office revealed government net debt has increased by 42% in one year from $430bn to $611bn. And yet there has been no increase in the amount the government needs repaying because interest rates have actually fallen.
Graph not displaying correctly? Click here The PBO estimated that in the December quarter last year debt interest repayments were $4.1bn – the same amount it was in December 2016 when total debt was half the current level. Imagine doubling your mortgage, but not your fortnightly repayments. In December 2016 the government paid around 2.8% interest on a 10-year bond; right now it is paying around 1.2%. And yet despite this, the fear of debt and deficit has returned. On Friday the man who took over Cormann’s role as finance minister, Simon Birmingham, said in a speech to the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce that if interest rates converge to their long-run level “federal government interest payment debt to a gross debt that would be some $44.5 billion larger in just a decade’s time”. He further suggested that “governments should only spend what is necessary”. “Australians should want our country, including its balance sheet, to be capable of responding to the next crisis,” the minister said. Except, of course, we currently are in the greatest crisis to face the world’s economy – climate change. We are also at a crucial moment, which requires massive investment in order to lower emissions. The EU are moving towards imposing a carbon import levy, and Australia now finds itself utterly struggling to make the cuts required to keep temperatures from rising 2C above pre-industrial levels. The Coalition only sees a crisis when it wants to. It refused to admit the GFC was one, and has never treated climate change as anything other than something to be mostly ignored. But despite all contrary evidence, they keep saying rising debt is a crisis. Do we really want to be telling people in a decade’s time that we couldn’t spend money needed to lower our emissions because interest rates were 1.2% and we were worried they might rise? The Coalition reacted to the economic impact of Covid-19 by dismissing concerns about debt. And yet when faced with a much greater impact of climate change they remain wedded to old canards that have been shown not to hold. But, to paraphrase Cormann, what is the alternative? Are you suggesting that we should not provide the support we need to get to net zero emissions to protect jobs, to protect livelihoods? Unless you deny climate change, there is no alternative."
2021-02-13T17:00:18Z,business,Business,Talk of a post-Covid spending spree shows Bank of England is out of touch,"Confidence is everything during a recovery. The question is, can Britons shake off their fears of infection and swagger back to work merely by looking in the mirror and telling themselves everything will be OK. At the Bank of England, some senior staff believe we are all about to do just that. Having looked into their crystal balls they predict that people who have saved their pennies during the pandemic – and many millions of workers and rich retired have done just that – will spend them when the nation is vaccinated. That is the view of the Bank of England governor – and the basis for his forecast that a strong recovery will be under way by autumn. Of course, should a new variant of the virus get the edge over vaccines and wreak havoc, all bets are off. But without a return to severe lockdowns and draconian restrictions, the economy is all set to bounce back quickly, driven by a consumer boom that will dwarf all predecessors with its intensity and size. “The risk is on the upside – that after you lock people up for this long, they go for it,” Andrew Bailey told the Observer last weekend. So sunny is Bailey’s view of Britain’s recovery that by early next year (March to be precise) we might hardly know a pandemic had happened at all, in economic terms. To say the Red Bull must be flowing through the usually austere corridors of Threadneedle Street is an understatement. Only a few days later, Bailey’s colleague, chief economist Andy Haldane, was in even more ebullient mood. He wrote in the Daily Mail last Friday that the UK had “enormous amounts of pent-up financial energy waiting to be released, like a coiled spring”. While the Bank’s nine-strong monetary policy committee predicted that consumers will spend around 5% of the estimated £250bn of savings that will be lying around in bank accounts by June, Haldane thinks the spending spree could be nearer 20%, or a whopping £50bn. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent was rather more circumspect when he gave his verdict, saying that lingering fears about new coronavirus variants could deter people from making major spending decisions. His comments were in line with the much more pessimistic analysis put forward by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, which also reported last week on its view of the year ahead.
The thinktank said unemployment was likely to rise sharply after the government’s furlough scheme ends in April and will reach 2.5 million – or 7.5% of the workforce – by the end of the year. Even if the chancellor extends the furlough scheme in his budget next month, it will only be because the recovery is delayed. In a comment that puts her at the opposite end of the forecasting spectrum to Haldane, the NIESR’s deputy director, Hande Küçük, said her yardstick was the global financial crisis of 2008-09, when it took five years for the UK to return to the pre-recession peak. It is worth looking back 13 years to see how the BoE’s predictions worked out after the UK economy proved to be, then as now, among those worst affected by calamity. The BoE was not alone when, in 2010, it forecast a swift recovery. The new Office for Budget Responsibility, created by George Osborne to provide independent forecasts for the Treasury, joined in. Both said that Britain’s private sector businesses were raring to invest in new equipment, IT and skilled people and the boost this would bring to productivity and wages would be so strong it might even trigger inflation. Of the two organisations, only the OBR apologised for its mistake when – by 2017, and with Brexit a supreme confidence-killer– it was clear such a boom was never going to happen, at least not across the broad swath of British business. But consumers did their bit and spent all their cash and more, despite austerity. There followed a rise in employment that might reasonably be called a surge, though much of it was a substitute for company bosses buying new equipment and depended on ultra-low wage increases and among the weakest workers’ rights in Europe. Inflation and interest rates remained at historic lows. Haldane says it is different this time and a year from now, annual growth could be in double digits and inflation up from 0.6% to 2% or more. Economic records are being broken all the time, so he may be right to say a historic recovery awaits. Or he could be spending too much time looking at data on his laptop. If he looked more carefully at mainstream life, he’d see that it is filled with people worried about their jobs and health, who think a trip to a pub or restaurant is not worth the risk."
2021-02-13T16:00:17Z,business,Business,"London fights for its financial crown, but it will be a stretch","When Michel Barnier railed against “brass plate” access to the EU’s single market, Britain’s financial services firms knew they were uppermost in the former Brexit negotiator’s thinking. Ever since the EU referendum vote in 2016, City firms have been quietly leasing space in Dublin, Luxembourg, Amsterdam and Paris to make sure they can conduct business with their EU clients without exporting more than a handful of staff. Most of the headquarters, jobs and tax revenues of Europe’s largest trading houses have remained in London. The question is, for how much longer? Now, within a month of the transition period ending, Amsterdam has stolen London’s crown as Europe’s major share trading centre. Last week an average €9.2bn (£8bn) of shares a day were bought and sold on the Dutch city’s three main exchanges, compared with €8.6bn in London. Likewise, the euro-denominated market in derivatives – instruments used to hedge against movements in currencies and interest rates – has flooded out of London to Amsterdam, Paris and, in a warning to the EU, to New York as well. Believing they have a right to feel as aggrieved as the fishing industry, financial lobbyists watched as Boris Johnson allowed British firms to lose their EU “passport” to the single market on 1 January when the Brexit transition period ended. The EU has said it could offer a deal that means City firms regaining “equivalence” – a mutual recognition of each side’s regulatory standards – though the approval system would be run by Brussels, making the UK a “rule taker”. In the meantime, the EU is clear that it expects jobs and business to move from the City. Mairead McGuinness, the European commissioner for financial services, said last week: “There has been this discussion around movement of employment and investment. Already some has happened and it is likely that more will follow.”
Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey and chancellor Rishi Sunak want to bring London back under the EU umbrella, first with a memorandum of understanding due to be negotiated by the end of March, and then with a fully fledged deal, but not at any cost. In a speech last week to City grandees, Bailey said any attempt by the EU to place stricter regulations on financial traders in London than on either equivalent EU centres or those in other countries – such as the US and Switzerland – would be unfair and most likely force the UK to walk away. Barnier has said the UK should commit to tracking every twist and turn of EU regulations in return for equivalence. In the City there is a weariness and a sense of gloom about the prospects for a deal. Nevertheless, fund management veteran Martin Gilbert, former vice-chairman of Standard Life Aberdeen, says a deal should be a top priority for Johnson’s government. With more than 50% of fund management assets in London coming from the EU, it is clear why this arm of the industry would want a deal. Speaking to the Observer, he said: “There are great opportunities for UK banks, insurers and asset managers in Asia, the Americas and Africa, but that does not mean the opportunities on the continent should be ignored.”
Gilbert is chairman of online money management firm Revolut, which had to switch 9 million EU accounts across the Channel after equivalence rights were lost. “Brexit has prompted a debate over divergence versus equivalence,” he said. “But much of the regulatory framework in place in Europe, in part driven and agreed by the UK when it was a member, works well and has benefited UK firms.” Catherine McGuinness, policy chief at the Corporation of London, said she was also optimistic one can be negotiated about a deal: “If the EU is intent on sucking business out of the UK, first there is a limit to how much will leave, and second, it should realise the main winner will be New York and other centres.” Kevin Ellis, chairman of accountancy firm PwC UK, agreed: “We mustn’t forget that London has a scale that isn’t easily replicated. For example, 2 million people are employed in financial services in the UK, and a million of those are in London. However, London does have to evolve to ensure its ongoing relationship with the EU and all of its trading partners.” Abrasive attitudes to the City taken by Brussels, France and Germany won’t come as a surprise to the Bank or No 10. In 2017, French president Emmanuel Macron, standing on Downing Street, eschewed diplomatic niceties when explaining his position on the post-Brexit landscape: “I want banks, talents, researchers, academics and so on. I think that France and the EU is a very attractive space.” And while Brexit has poured fuel on this fire, the desire to undermine the City isn’t even particularly new. With the launch of the euro, and the decision of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown not to join it, the Square Mile’s position as Europe’s premier financial hub had been seen by influential figures in EU capitals and policymakers in Brussels as a dangerous anomaly, posing a risk to the bloc’s economic stability. The 2007-8 economic crisis was said by some to be the fault of a deregulatory “Anglo-Saxon” form of capitalism, and tensions have persisted since then. In 2011, David Cameron complained of “constant attack through Brussels directives” on the UK’s financial services sector. Indeed, while there was some surprise that the UK did not try to get more for its financial services sector during the last year of negotiations, it was always a bit of a lost cause. The handful of equivalence decisions to allow UK financial services to continue to operate in the EU market were made purely on a temporary basis and to avoid any risk to its own economic stability. The message from Irish commissioner Mairead McGuinness recently has been clear: don’t expect that to change any time soon.
Who gains from the UK’s loss? Amsterdam The Dutch capital has been the biggest beneficiary of a move of share trading from London into the EU, with daily volumes quadrupling to €9.2bn (£8.1bn) in January compared with December, according to CBOE Europe. Dublin Dublin was the most popular location for financial services companies moving jobs out of London, according to data up to October 2020 tracked by EY. A total of 34 companies, including asset managers, insurers and banks including the UK’s Barclays and Bank of America, said they had moved jobs to the Irish capital. Luxembourg Low-tax Luxembourg is a favoured domicile for investment funds, and according to EY it was second to Dublin in gaining jobs. Credit Suisse, Lloyds Banking Group and Citibank have all moved jobs to the Grand Duchy. Paris President Emmanuel Macron, who is a former banker, has made clear his desire to attract more business to Paris after Brexit. A Parisian lobby group has estimated a gain of 3,500 jobs, among them workers from JP Morgan and Japan’s Nomura, as well as prodigal sons from France’s Société Générale and BNP Paribas. Frankfurt The German city, home of the European Central Bank, has long been seen as London’s main European rival. It has gained hundreds of billions of euros of banking assets from US banks such as Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. German bank Helaba predicted 3,500 job moves by the end of 2021. Wall Street Trading in derivatives, contracts used to protect against market movements, was a key strength of the City. Yet US financial centres were among the winners after London’s share of global derivatives trade slumped from just under 40% in July 2020 to about 10% last month, data company IHS Markit said.

2021-02-13T16:00:16Z,business,Business,How the City became the UKâ€™s powerhouse,"As the UK unwittingly approached the 2007 global banking crisis, London’s financial sector – known simply as the City, or the Square Mile – was reaching the height of its powers. One in every £12 of British economic output was generated by financial services, and bankers were labelled masters of the universe. The crash punctured those illusions, and rebalanced the UK economy slightly (albeit at painful cost): output from financial services and insurance slipped from 8.3% of 2007 UK GDP before banks were bailed out to 6.3% in 2019, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The UK’s departure from the EU has prompted further soul-searching in the City, as some business leaves these shores. Yet it could be some time before other sectors can challenge the financial sector’s importance in the UK economy. London’s central place in the world economy is in no small part a legacy of Britain’s empire, with banks oiling the wheels of colonisation. By 1919 the economist John Maynard Keynes could already compare rich Londoners to kings of old, ordering exotic luxuries and able to “adventure their wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages”.
Keynes was writing after the first world war, just as the British empire was waning. The City of London survived the second world war, but by the 1960s, after the austere postwar years, it was in danger of becoming a backwater, as the power of the UK and sterling declined. That changed as London positioned itself as a legally secure centre for the movement of dollars – but one outside the reach of US regulators. London’s central role in these offshore transactions, known as the eurodollar system, means deals worth trillions of pounds wash through the City every month, even if only a tiny proportion of any real economic activity actually takes place within the UK’s borders. Average daily turnover in foreign exchange reached $3.6 trillion in April 2019, according to the Bank of England’s latest survey. Trade in derivatives – contracts used by companies to protect themselves against market movements – was worth $3.7tn in the same period. Helped by the “big bang” in the 1980s – a policy of deregulation by the Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher – the “City” overflowed the bounds of the ancient walls of London, which are marked by cast-iron dragons. The deregulation, which allowed foreign firms to undercut the fat commissions of London’s old boys’ network, attracted banks from the US and elsewhere to the Canary Wharf redevelopment in the East End. Across Britain, financial services and related sectors such as accounting and law now employ more than 2.3 million people, according to TheCityUK, a lobby group. Two-thirds of those workers are outside London, but the concentration of the best-paying jobs in the City is a significant factor in regional inequality. The ONS reports that the median Londoner earned £736.50 a week in April 2019, £150 more than the average Briton. The flip side of that inequality is that the City is a big contributor to government coffers. The UK financial services sector contributed £75.6bn in tax in the year to March 2020 – a record – according to the City of London Corporation, the body that governs the Square Mile as well as lobbying for its financial and professional services.
Catherine McGuinness, the corporation’s policy chair, said the City was playing a vital role in the UK’s economic recovery during the pandemic, including giving out loans and deferrals on a sixth of UK mortgages. “The UK continues to lead the world when it comes to financial and professional services but now is not the time to rest on our laurels,” she said. “In order to rise to the challenges facing us, we need to invest in infrastructure and skills across the country.” Yet the UK’s reliance on the City extends beyond the chancellor’s budgets: London’s cultural life is just as dependent on the finance industry. The Donmar Warehouse theatre is supported by Barclays, and art exhibitions at the Tate galleries are backed by Bank of America, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank. Banking’s influence on Britain’s sporting life extends from the rarefied atmospheres of the boat race between Cambridge and Oxford, and Lord’s cricket ground – sponsored recently by Wall Street giants BNY Mellon and JP Morgan respectively – through to the football Premier League, whose last title sponsor was Barclays. For London-based clubs the City provides access to the lucrative prawn sandwich brigade, with corporate hospitality offering healthy earnings for clubs including Arsenal and Chelsea, whatever the objections from more nostalgic fans."
2021-02-13T14:33:27Z,business,Business,Greene King renames four pubs in England over racism concerns,"The brewery chain Greene King has renamed four of its pubs over concerns the names had perceived links to racism. Three pubs called the Black Boy and another called the Black’s Head will be given new titles, but Greene King said it would take some time for the signs to be changed. Greene King’s managing director, Wayne Shurvinton, acknowledged there was a perception that the names were linked with racism but said their origins were obscure. Shurvinton said the chain “knew we had to take this step if we wanted to continue on our journey to become a truly anti-racist organisation”. Last year, Greene King apologised for its links to slavery, having been founded by and named after the plantation owner Benjamin Greene in 1799. After consulting with staff, the firm said it was working on plans to invest in Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities. Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust, a racial equality thinktank, welcomed the news, saying the names had been a daily reminder of a history of oppression, but said the measures did not go far enough. “The company has made several symbolic efforts to address its founder’s legacy of oppression, not least by diversifying its hiring practices and through its work with the Slavery Museum in Liverpool – but is the renaming of a few pubs enough to make amends? No. Not in the slightest,” she told the BBC. “No doubt members of BAME communities walk past these hostelries and read the names above the door every day. They are essentially having the history of oppression rubbed in their faces on a daily basis. “We should not single out Greene King. Many companies that remain household names today profited from the unconscionable ownership and exploitation of black people.” New names for the pubs were decided via online polls, which attracted more than 7,000 people. After the results were compiled, the Black Boy pub in Bury St Edmunds will be renamed the West Gate; a pub in Sudbury, Suffolk, will be titled the Lady Elizabeth; and one in Shinfield, Berkshire, will be renamed the Shinfield Arms. The Black’s Head in Wirksworth, Derbysire, will be named the Quarryman. There are an estimated 70 pubs in the UK called the Black Boy, but the exact origins are unknown. The name was believed to have been a nickname for King Charles II, used by his mother, and this is often cited as the origin of the pub title."
2021-02-13T06:00:06Z,business,Business,"After Topshop owner Arcadia's demise, what now for UK clothes shopping?","Sir Philip Green’s fashion empire Arcadia is no more, with its famous brands, including Topshop, carved up by online retailers leaving behind a ghost chain of 500 shops. The sale to Boohoo of its last three high street names – Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton – was confirmed this week. It completed the dismantling of Arcadia, which under Green’s ownership was the last vestige of the Burton Group built by 20th century retail trailblazer Sir Montague Burton. Its demise raises big questions about the future of clothes shopping in the UK. People are going to be “quite shocked” when they go back to the high street, says Jane Shepherdson, who as brand director of Topshop in the early noughties was the most powerful woman in British retail. “I don’t think people have realised what it is going to be like,” she adds.“If you think about the main high street in a city centre, there is a lot that has gone.”
The Arcadia store closures follow hundreds of clothing store closures last year with fashion shops, after betting and mobile phone stores, the most common type of retail unit to shut in the first half of 2020, according to the Local Data Company.
The Covid-19 crisis had a dramatic impact on spending in 2020. Clothing and footwear sales slumped by a quarter and for the first time more than half of the £40bn spent by shoppers was online. While the balance of power will tip back towards physical stores once the lockdowns end, analysts at retail consultancy GlobalData expect that more than 40% of fashion and footwear will continue to be bought online, compared with less than 30% pre-pandemic. Older chains with large store estates which had not invested enough in home delivery and online channels have suffered the most from the swift sea change in shopping habits. Green bought Arcadia Group for £850m in 2002 and banked a £1.2bn dividend three years later, which remains one of the biggest pay cheques in corporate history, leaving the company with less to invest on keeping up with events. At the time, Green was able to boast of a 10% rise in profits at his fashion empire which had 2,000 outlets and the prospect of a global brand in Topshop. By the time it fell into administration last year Arcadia was making losses, its store estate cut to 500 stores and Topshop but a shadow of the “It Girl” it once was.
Montague Burton must be “turning in his grave”, says Stuart Rose, the former Marks & Spencer boss who sold the then listed Arcadia to Green. “No brand has got the right to live forever but it could have had a better maturity than it has had. It is a sad end.” However, to argue that retail is facing an existential crisis due to Covid-19 is to forget previous shocks such as the 2008 banking crisis and inflationary crises of the 1970s and 80s, says Rose. “During every one of those eruptions there has been a shakeout and mostly what has happened is the weaker have died and the stronger have survived,” he explains. In all likelihood no more mega shopping malls will be built and the high streets of the future will have fewer shops on them, but Rose says people “aren’t stopping shopping”. “Arcadia and Debenhams have gone but the people who are left will probably do OK because there will be a bit more to go round.” The carve-up of Arcadia prompted online fashion retailer Asos to snap up Topshop, deemed the jewel in crown, as well as Topman and Miss Selfridge for £330m. Boohoo paid £25m for the trio of Arcadia’s lesser brands.
Manchester-based Boohoo also recently bought the Debenhams name, again shorn of its 124 stores and army of 12,000 shop staff. It too was also once part of the Burton Group, in its day a FTSE 100 company. Debenhams might be disappearing from the high street but rival chain John Lewis says shops have an important role, especially when it comes to fashion, with shoppers heading to stores to seek out advice from its personal stylists. We get a “certain joy” from visiting our favourite shops, says John Lewis’s head of womenswear, Jo Bennett, who says customers like to physically browse clothes and shoes when they are putting together an outfit. “Many of us are looking forward to going out and shopping again.” Terrible job losses aside, some of the brands disappearing from the high street were “not good enough for what we need now … and usually just made white men rich”, says retail guru Mary Portas. “Lots of people got made rich doing stuff that wasn’t exactly brilliant. I think we are going to see less but better.” Although the online-only deals for Arcadia’s brands might suggest otherwise Portas believes teenagers and twentysomethings still want to buy clothes from shops.
“They just don’t want bland,” says Portas pointing to the busy stores of streetwear brands such as Supreme. “They have a cultural resonance and relevance to what’s happening today. They have put soul into the physical space and that is what we need to do.” Shepherdson agrees that high street retailers will have to “up their game” to attract shoppers after the pandemic. “I love shops myself,” she adds, explaining part of the thrill for fashion lovers is “seeing what other people are wearing”.
“It is really dull shopping online. I want instant gratification. I can’t believe that people don’t still love the social aspect.” The shift to online shopping has left the UK with too many stores and even after the carnage wrought by the pandemic it is estimated there will be 25% more retail space than required. In the future fashion shops might be less prevalent in town and city centres but analysts think they might spring up closer to home amid what looks like a permanent shift to home-working for many.
“If more money is being spent locally then we can reimagine what a local high street might look like,” says Lorna Hall, head of fashion insight at WGSN. The darkest hour is just before the dawn, with Bank of England policymakers predicting Britons will go on a mammoth spending spree once restrictions are lifted. “I suspect there is pent up demand because people have been saving money and they will want to get out,” says Rose. “There is a limit to how much you want to just browse through another bloody website.”"
2021-02-13T06:00:06Z,business,Business,'I feel let down': two former Arcadia staff on losing their jobs,"Sir Philip Green’s retail empire Arcadia has been broken up after falling into administration last year. Its brands, which include Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge, have been sold to the online retailers Asos and Boohoo, but all the stores are shutting, meaning the vast majority of its 13,000 staff are losing their jobs. We have talked to two Arcadia employees who have been made redundant after the group’s collapse. Elizabeth Ford, 57, Warrington Elizabeth Ford had worked for Topshop and Topman for 38 years before she lost her job last week. “I loved it and for the first time in my life I’m having to claim jobseeker’s allowance,” she said.
Working in various roles such as a back of house manager and more recently as a sales assistant, Ford had been employed at the Warrington branch in Cheshire since 1982. “I feel let down by a company I’ve championed for nearly 40 years. I’ve not got to the angry stage yet but I’m sure it will come.” Ford said she was asked to attend a conference call with her area manager Tuesday last week, a day after Asos was announced as the new owner of Topshop. During the call she said she was told Asos would only be trading online and that their notice period was effective immediately. “The week before I was saying to staff that it’s not over till it’s over,” Ford said. “I was convinced that if they wanted to close Topshop they would have closed all the stores at the same time, and that there were around 80 stores that were viable and profitable. So I was shocked and disappointed to hear that was it.”
Though she and her colleagues did not need to, Ford spent the first week of her notice period packing up the shop. “Everyone came in. They could have stayed at home but it’s testament to the kind of team we were. On our last day we had some pizza and a little awards ceremony before we handed the keys in. It was very emotional.” Looking to the future, Ford “fancies a change”. “My father died of Covid in January so I was thinking I could maybe deliver prescriptions to the elderly and give back a bit. “I’m dumbstruck – I loved my job, the company and the people I worked for. I understand it’s a really tough time on the high street and a lot won’t survive but I can’t imagine a high street without a Topshop – it’s scandalous really.”
James, 37, Walsall After 20 years of working for Arcadia, James, from Walsall, in the West Midlands, is now looking for work. “There was always a risk we would lose our jobs but for it to happen during lockdown has made it worse than we could ever have imagined,” said the 37-year-old, who was a duty manager at a West Bromwich branch of Outfit, Arcadia’s multibrand outlet.
James, who asked for his surname to be withheld, spent 12 years with Burton and Dorothy Perkins and finished his employment working at an Outfit branch. He said his employment was terminated effective immediately.
“It’s very upsetting especially considering how long I’ve been working with the company. When I started working at Burton there were older employees who were very proud of the store and its history. The news is all about Topshop, but the group’s origins are from Burton, which seem to get ignored, bringing more upset to staff.” He said it was quite difficult finding a job but added that some companies had been offering direct hire roles to those who used to work for Arcadia. “We did have one email from Aldi saying they were recruiting so a lot of us have responded to that. It’s quite concerning. The only stores that have a similar customer to Outfit are Next and River Island but we don’t know when shops will open again – no one appears to be recruiting at the moment. “Will shops return to the high street? A lot of us think in a few years there will be demand for it again as customers will be getting fed up of posting refunds back and not being able to try items on first. “We were clinging on to Burton stores still trading in their original buildings but the administrators have ended Sir Montague Burton’s legacy which is really sad.”"
2021-02-13T00:05:01Z,business,Business,"As KPMG’s boss has learned, caring about employees is now cool","Millennials are flexing their power in the workplace. From women’s rights to demands for tougher action on climate change, younger staff are forcing the pace. Last week the boss of KPMG stepped down amid protests from staff about his behaviour during an online meeting. The accountancy firm’s UK chair, Bill Michael, who has headed the company since 2017, told staff to “stop moaning” during a virtual meeting about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. He also called unconscious bias, which many businesses have attempted to confront through changes to their training and recruitment practices, “complete and utter crap”. Michael apologised for his comments, but KPMG employed the City law firm Linklaters to conduct an independent inquiry. Before it could report, the 52-year-old Australian quit the business. There are plenty of bosses who consider their younger staff to be snowflakes, or somehow weak-willed when they talk about their wellbeing or mental health issues. Michael said at another point in his presentation that too many staff saw themselves as victims, which he said wasn’t true unless they were sick. “Take control of your life and don’t sit there and moan about it,” he urged. In recent years KPMG has signed up to become a living wage business, which means it not only pays its staff a higher level than the minimum wage, but also forces its suppliers and contractors to pay a living wage. It regularly appears in lists of the best firms to work for, and boasts about its flexible working schemes. So it is possible that Michael was being held to a higher standard than many other bosses. However, that is the modern corporate world, and it is as it should be. Boardrooms are becoming aware of how their staff feel, and taking notice. They are also addressing the need to go further and think about the communities they operate in, and about a word that fell out of favour 15 years ago but is making a comeback – stakeholders. Even from a cynical, profit-driven stance, happier employees tend to be more creative and work harder. Some of the biggest US firms have struggled to make the transition. Google has regularly faced protests from its staff about boardroom policies that are considered antithetical to the purpose and vision of the firm. In 2019 staff staged an unprecedented series of walkouts from offices across the world in protest at the company’s treatment of women. Employees said that sexual misconduct allegations were being mishandled; they also wanted a directive that forced staff to accept the verdict of an internal arbitration system to be scrapped. Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said staff had the right to take the action. However, his sympathy didn’t stop hundreds of employees at the internet giant’s Silicon Valley HQ from becoming so fed up that last month they formed a union – the Alphabet Workers Union – which also represents other companies owned by Google’s parent group. The B Corp movement, a trust that assesses a company’s intentions and how good it is at matching the rhetoric with deeds, draws most of its membership on both sides of the Atlantic from smaller businesses. These are mainly start-ups that claim to have a purpose beyond making a profit, whether it be to reverse climate change or to alleviate poverty in their local community. They are not charities, but the ultimate aim for many is to sell out to the employees, following a similar model to the John Lewis Partnership. French yoghurt maker Danone and the Guardian’s owner, GMG are among the companies to sign up. Unilever is following the same theme, testing out a four-day week as a way to support employees. These are firms that embrace shifting with the times. KPMG has shown it also wants to stay on course. Whatever Tesla calls it, buying bitcoins is still speculation It was a big week, on the face of it, for bitcoinand its battalion of enthusiasts who say cryptocurrencies will soon become mainstream. Not only did Tesla announce that it had spent $1.5bn on bitcoins, but Bank of New York Mellon, the US’s oldest bank – which has been strictly mainstream for a couple of centuries – said it had created a “digital assets” unit. And Mastercard said it would be supporting “select cryptocurrencies” on its network later this year. Naturally, the price of bitcoins soared – the $50,000 mark is in sight, versus $10,000 a year ago. These developments feel vaguely significant – but not to the degree the cryptocurrency crew would like to think. BNY Mellon and Mastercard were merely saying, in effect, that cryptocurrencies can now be slotted into existing financial architecture, so if customers really want to adopt them, they will make it happen – presumably for the normal fee. That doesn’t tell us anything about the level of take-up. Tesla also said it would accept payment in bitcoins – and others will probably follow. But let’s wait to see whether there is real demand for transacting in bitcoins. Their main use to date seems to be as a unit of speculation. Indeed, speculation seemed to be motive behind Tesla’s purchase – it sees holding bitcoins as a way to “further diversify and maximise returns on our cash”. If that type of thinking were to catch on among large companies, then, yes, that would a big development. It seems unlikely, however. A financial asset that can rise and fall in value by 10% in a day is of no use to corporate treasury departments, which generally seek dullness and steadiness. Tesla clearly craves excitement, but 99.9% of companies don’t. Note the reply of Dara Khosrowshahi, chief executive of Uber, when asked whether his firm would be bagging a few bitcoins. It was a firm no: “We’re going to keep our cash safe. We’re not in the speculation business.” Quite. Shell’s gas deal was never a good fit with its green ambitions It is easy to forget that Royal Dutch Shell was once one of the leading voices among major oil companies in the call for climate action. Shell emerged from the 2015 oil market crash with the promise that it would move towards renewable energy, and prepare for oil prices that were “lower for ever”. Soon after, it began spending $1bn to $2bn a year to forge a path into clean energy and electric mobility. The green investments were small compared with its spending on fossil fuels, but large compared with most of its oil industry peers at the time. Shell’s boss, Ben van Beurden, hoped to prove the green business hypothesis by the early 2020s to “turbocharge” these ambitions. It is already clear that Shell has not yet been fully convinced by the argument for a greener energy future. Its climate strategy, set out last week, left market analysts underwhelmed and green campaigners outraged. It also underlined just how far behind its rivals Shell has fallen in the race to go green. The strategy was branded “grotesque” by Greenpeace, which heaped (cautious) praise on BP for setting genuinely ambitious near-term climate targets last year. The roots of Shell’s floundering may be traced back to another development in 2015. At the time Shell paid $52bn to take over BG Group, a leader in shipping liquefied natural gas (LNG) on super-chilled tankers across the globe. The ink on the Paris climate agreement had barely dried but there were already warnings that the career-defining mega-deal would prove to be a millstone around Van Beurden’s neck. Today, Shell’s climate efforts are undermined by plans to grow its LNG business by almost a fifth by the middle of the decade, in what may be one final effort to wring value from the deal. Until Shell can leave its fossil fuel past behind, it will struggle to turbocharge its sustainable future."

L’Oréal, which owns more than 30 brands including Maybelline, Lancôme and Garnier, said it thought sales would accelerate sharply as vaccines were distributed and infection rates dropped. In a reference to hedonism of the 1920s, following the first world war and 1918 flu pandemic, Jean-Paul Agon, the L’Oréal chief executive, on Friday predicted a “fiesta” in the beauty market. “People will be happy to go out again, to socialise,” said Agon. “This will be like the Roaring 20s, there will be a fiesta in makeup and in fragrances. Putting on lipstick again will be a symbol of returning to life.” Cosmetics sales have plummeted during the pandemic as store closures, coupled with the shift to homeworking, saw many women to ditch their makeup bags. During the original lockdown sales of products once considered an essential part of a daily beauty routine, such as foundation and lipstick, dropped by more than 70%. L’Oréal’s sales in China, where many Covid-19 restrictions were eased relatively swiftly last year after a strict lockdown, provide a glimpse of what the recovery could look like. Sales there rose 27% in 2020. The roaring 20s, when people wore daring fashions and partied, were a US not a UK phenomenon, chronicled in the novels of the time including F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby. However, the French company is not the only one predicting good times will roll once the pandemic ends.
Last week, Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, suggested people might “go for it” once the vaccine programme allowed the economy to reopen and they could spend the money they had saved. Last year, UK sales of designer makeup brands sold at counters in department stores fell by more than 40%, a decrease worth almost £500m. The slump was even bigger if the near-£200m hit to sales of cheaper lipsticks and eyeshadows bought in supermarkets is included. While social lives have been on hold, cosmetics groups have benefited from a step up in demand for skincare products – the makeup equivalent of the leisurewear people have also been wearing – such as face creams and body lotion, to pamper themselves at home. Shoppers also switched to the web to buy beauty products with L’Oréal’s online sales up by two-thirds in 2020."

2021-02-12T13:14:29Z,business,Business,'We need more help': three firms on surviving the UK's Covid-19 economy,"The UK economy recorded the deepest economic contraction for 300 years in 2020 but it has avoided a double-dip recession during the second wave of Covid-19. The Guardian spoke to three company bosses about how they have adapted during lockdown and the pressures they face amid tougher restrictions at the start of this year. William & Victoria, Harrogate, Yorkshire
Jo and David Straker started operating takeaways from their Harrogate bistro William & Victoria during the first lockdown. “It’s like starting a new business each time,” Jo says, referring to having to adapt each time the rules changed. The November lockdown in England was tough as competition from other restaurants that didn’t offer takeaways in the first wave intensified, while the loss of Christmas bookings was a further setback. January is usually busy, but Straker says the latest lockdown and loss of visitors to Harrogate’s convention centre (converted into a Nightingale hospital) has renewed pressure. “It’s all a bit rubbish, we’re probably doing about 50-60% of the takeaway business we were doing in the summer when people had a bit more appetite for it.” Having secured a £50,000 bounce-back loan from Lloyds Banking Group, placed its staff on furlough and received a grant from the council, the business is just about managing to pull through. But given multiple lockdowns and changes to restrictions, and no details about when they will be relaxed, Straker fears for the future. “It’s quite tough, we feel very deflated. It’s all that stop-start,” she says. “With three children at school, one doing their GCSEs, it’s just not knowing what the future is. I had felt like everyone was in this situation, but now it feels like there are winners and losers. And we feel in hospitality to be among the losers; we need more government help.” McArthurGlen, Ashford, Kent
Far from the usual 10,000 customers each day, the busiest the McArthurGlen designer outlet in Ashford tends to get during lockdown is when joggers circle the retail park to notch up new records on the running app Strava. Lockdown might have triggered a collapse in visitors, but the Kent shopping destination had a strong December as consumers rushed to buy presents while restrictions were relaxed before Christmas. “People were predicting another lockdown was coming, so we saw a lot of people out buying Christmas presents. That spend was really strong in December, pre-empting that we would close again,” says Peter Corr, centre manager of the outlet. Footfall dropped in the summer, but average spend per customer rose 10% as fewer people came just to browse. During the latest lockdown, business is ticking over with help from a new virtual shopping service, and as some brands open for click and collect, and restaurants such as Five Guys and Pizza Express operate takeaways. Despite major challenges for the high street from the rise of online shopping, Corr expects that physical stores will bounce back. “Though it’s been an absolutely devastating blow to retail in general over the last 12 months, I do believe there is light at the end of the tunnel.” Goodwood Estate, West Sussex
Cancellation of its motoring festival and horse-racing last year might have hit the Goodwood Estate hard, but a boom in summer tourism from domestic holidaymakers helped it to stay afloat. “All of that was obviously a tremendous hit; like everyone else we battened down the hatches and survived,” says Andrew Coggings, managing director of the 12,000-acre estate in rural West Sussex. The business – which employs 600 people at the house, hotel, private members’ club, organic farm, golf course and its event catering – had an excellent October despite the tiering system, as holidaymakers kept coming late into the year. But renewed closure in November and a bad December kept up the pressure. “When we reopen we have to take people off furlough to get to our minimum staffing level, but we discovered in December the demand really wasn’t there. We tried to operate but the tiers system just didn’t work.” With three wedding venues that would normally cater for 50 couples a year, Coggings says Goodwood, a member of the Sussex chamber of commerce, needed clarity from the government about the relaxation of Covid rules this spring to help the company and its guest plan for the future. “We are seeing a few cancel at the moment, they’re just giving up. We need a strategy first of all from the government to give us clarity, and then we need to understand the longer term. We’re raring to go.”"
2021-02-12T12:55:53Z,business,Business,"Nigerians can bring claims against Shell in UK, supreme court rules","Two Nigerian communities can bring their legal claims for a cleanup and for compensation against the oil company Shell and its Nigerian subsidiary in an English court, supreme court judges have said. In what lawyers said was a “watershed moment” for the accountability of multinational companies, on Friday the court overturned a decision by the court of appeal, and ruled that the cases against Shell could proceed. The judges said the court of appeal was wrong when it said the company was not responsible for the harm caused by oil extraction in the Niger delta, because it was merely a holding company for Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC). It had also erred, the judges said, when it carried out a mini-trial of the facts before the disclosure of relevant documents. “There are real issues to be tried,” the supreme court said. The law firm Leigh Day, which represents the communities, successfully argued that Shell, one of the world’s 10 largest corporations by revenue with assets of more than $400bn (£290bn), must answer for the environmental failures of its subsidiary because the company is registered in London. The villagers, from the Ogale and Bille communities, say they have been affected by oil pollution for years because of Shell’s operations in Nigeria, including the pollution of their drinking water. Shell did not dispute that both communities had been severely polluted by its oil, or that there was yet to be an adequate cleanup of the pollution. Instead, it argued that Royal Dutch Shell plc could not be legally responsible for the harm caused to the communities, and so the cases should not be heard in England. The communities have been fighting for five years to have their cases heard in the English courts. They are pursuing legal claims against Shell through the English courts because they say there is no prospect of obtaining justice in Nigeria. Daniel Leader, a partner at Leigh Day, said: “This supreme court judgment gives real hope to the people of Ogale and Bille, who have been asking Shell to clean up their oil for years. We hope that now, finally, Shell will act. “But it also represents a watershed moment in the accountability of multinational companies. Increasingly, impoverished communities are seeking to hold powerful corporate actors to account and this judgment will significantly increase their ability to do so.” A report last year by Friends of the Earth, Amnesty International and other NGOs said the people of Ogoniland were still waiting for a thorough cleanup of the oil spills. The report said only11% of the total area contaminated was being cleaned up, and even in the area targeted the work had not been completed. The report said: “In order to address its devastating legacy of pollution in Nigeria, Shell should also pay for cleanup of the rest of the Niger delta and compensate communities affected by its activities. “The tragic and unresolved situation in Ogoniland demonstrates the urgency for governments – including those of the UK and the Netherlands where Shell is headquartered – to issue strong legislation mandating companies to respect human rights and environmental standards across their global operations.” Nigerians from the Ogale and Bille communities say they have suffered decades of pollution, including the contamination of their water wells with potentially cancer-causing chemicals, as well as the devastation of mangrove vegetation, all of which was documented by the United Nations Environment Programme in a groundbreaking report in 2011. The report said it could take 30 years to clean up the pollution caused by oil extraction and recommended an initial fund of $1bn (£800m) for the first five years to be paid by the oil companies that operate in Ogoniland, of which Shell is the largest. Shell has been contacted for comment."
2021-02-12T12:26:06Z,business,Business,KPMG's Bill Michael: from hosting the Queen to abrupt resignation,"Less than two months ago, Bill Michael welcomed the Queen on a virtual visit to KPMG’s new innovation hub during the accounting firm’s 150th anniversary celebrations. One imagines his comments during the video call with the monarch were less blunt than those he made to staff during Monday’s virtual town hall meeting, which have now prompted his resignation. The 52-year-old Australian with a straight-talking manner had led the big-four firm since 2017, having worked his way to the top after time as its global head of banking and capital markets. The son of Greek and Cypriot immigrants, Michael grew up in a working-class Melbourne suburb, and his election to the role of chair by the firm’s partners seemed to signal a desire for change at KPMG. He was reportedly called the “Donald Trump candidate”. In the job, Michael, who is married with three children, was known for his direct, even abrasive, style. Some insiders at the firm seemed unsurprised by his forthright remarks at this week’s town hall meeting. One anonymous staff member said it was “not the first, second, or third time that Bill Michael has made such insensitive, throwaway comments”. The leaking of the video of the Zoom meeting, during which Michael told colleagues to “stop moaning” about the Covid-19 pandemic and the effect of lockdown on their lives, and described unconscious bias as “utter crap”, points to unhappiness and anger inside the firm. Michael took a 14% pay cut in 2020, more than the rest of the firm’s partners, bringing his earnings to £1.7m, but that was not enough to quell discontent over the partners’ pay cuts or the wider cost-cutting measures he pushed through during his tenure."
2021-02-12T11:03:51Z,business,Business,O2 fined £10.5m for customer overcharging over almost a decade,"The mobile operator O2 has been fined £10.5m for overcharging 140,000 customers several million pounds as a result of billing errors that persisted for almost a decade. The telecoms regulator, Ofcom, said the fine – which was reduced from £15m because of O2’s cooperation with its investigation – related to errors in the final bills received by customers leaving the operator. The investigation found that between 2011 and 2019 an error in the way O2’s systems calculated final bills meant that many customers were billed for some fees and charges twice. More than 250,000 customers were billed a total of £40.7m in incorrect charges. The bills of many of the customers being disconnected were already in arrears, meaning they did not actually pay the incorrect extra charges, but 140,000 departing customers did pay £2.4m in fees they should not have. “Mobile customers trust their provider to bill them correctly and fix errors as quickly as possible,” said Ofcom’s enforcement director, Gaucho Rasmussen. “But these billing issues continued for a number of years without sufficient action from O2, and thousands of customers were overcharged as a result. “This is a serious breach of our rules and this fine is a reminder that we will step in if we see companies failing to protect their customers.”
Ofcom said the UK’s biggest mobile operator had initially identified the problem with its billing processes as far back as 2011 but “efforts to address these problems were not successful and customers continued to be overcharged”. O2, which has fixed its billing process, has refunded all the customers affected in full, plus an additional 4%. For those the company has been unable to track down, a donation equivalent to the overcharged amount has been made to charity. “We are disappointed by this technical error and sincerely apologise to customers impacted,” an O2 spokesman said. “As Ofcom have stated today, the vast majority of funds reported were not overpaid. We identified the issue ourselves and notified our industry billing auditor.”"
2021-02-12T10:47:06Z,business,Business,Lastminute.com faces legal action unless it repays £1m holiday refunds,"The UK competition watchdog has said it will take legal action against Lastminute.com unless it pays more than £1m in refunds within the next seven days to customers it still owes for holidays cancelled because of the Covid-19 pandemic. In December, the flight and hotel booking site agreed to pay £7m in refunds by the end of January to more than 9,000 customers whose holidays were cancelled because of coronavirus, following an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority. The CMA stepped in after holidaymakers spent months unsuccessfully trying to secure refunds from the online travel agent, many dating back to trips cancelled during the UK lockdown in March and April. The CMA said on Friday that Lastminute.com still owed more than £1m to 2,600 customers, two weeks after its promised repayment deadline. In addition, the regulator said that since Lastminute.com made its promise in December, it had continued to flout rules by failing to refund new customers who have had their package holiday cancelled within the required 14-day period. The company, which is owned and operated by Swiss group Bravofly, has also told some package holiday customers to seek a refund from their airline to get the cost of their flights back. The CMA said this was a breach of obligations under the Package Travel Regulations.
“It is wholly unacceptable that thousands of Lastminute.com customers are still waiting for full refunds for package holidays despite the commitments the company signed with us,” said Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA. “We take breaches of commitments extremely seriously. If Lastminute.com does not comply with the law and pay people their outstanding refunds quickly, we will take the company to court.” The CMA said Last minute.com had seven days to pay all outstanding refunds or it would begin legal action against the company. Lastminute.com “sincerely apologised” but also said that Ryanair was partly to blame because the airline had told customers to contact it direct for refunds. Lastminute.com said this has created confusion as it does not know which package holiday customers have asked or received a refund from Ryanair directly. “Despite all our efforts and commitment we did not meet the CMA’s undertaking’s deadline for [a] small proportion of customers because of the impact of the unforeseen third lockdown and Ryanair disrupting the refund process,” said Andrea Bertoli, managing director at Lastminute.com. “We sincerely apologise to all customers still waiting for their package holiday refunds and we are making every effort to resolve any remaining delays customers are facing.” Since the start of the pandemic, the CMA has written to more than 100 package holiday firms to remind them of their obligations to comply with consumer protection law, and has secured refund commitments from Virgin Holidays, TUI UK, Sykes Cottages and Vacation Rentals."
2021-02-12T09:30:56Z,business,Business,"The UK may not be in a double-dip recession, but it will feel like it","If 1709 was the year of the Great Frost then economic historians will remember 2020 as the year of the Great Pandemic. Everything that has happened to output has been related to Covid-19. Overall, the economy as measured by gross domestic product fell by 9.9% from its 2019 level, making it the biggest fall since modern records began. At least for now, because 1921 runs 2020 reasonably close as an economic horror show, and at this stage the Office for National Statistics is only giving its first growth estimates. Upward revisions are possible when more data comes in, but according to the Bank of England nothing like 2020 has been seen since Queen Anne was on the throne in the early 18th century.
In the here and now, the UK received a modest – if temporary boost – as the four-week lockdown imposed in England in November was relaxed. The service sector businesses that had been most severely affected by restrictions, such as pubs and restaurants, saw activity rise early in the month before being forced to shut again as December drew to a close.
Growth in both December and the fourth quarter of 2020 was marginally stronger than economists had expected, and there were a number of reasons for that. Restrictions were not as draconian as they had been in the spring, businesses learned how to adapt, there was a boost to the output of the health sector from the ramping up of the Covid test and trace programme, and there was some stockpiling by manufacturers bfore the end-of-year Brexit deadline. The fact that the economy expanded by 1.0% in the period between October and December means that the UK has avoided a double-dip recession – two separate periods in which GDP contracts for at least two quarters.
But even if this is not a double-dip recession it is going to feel like one, because the sharp slowdown in activity between the third and fourth quarters of 2020 will be followed by a big slump in output in the first three months of 2021. The fresh downturn could easily lead output to fall by a further 4%. Rishi Sunak’s response to the latest ONS figures was telling. There were rumours coming out of the Treasury a few months ago that the chancellor would start withdrawing support for the economy in the 3 March budget in order to start repairing the damage caused to the public finances. That idea has been overtaken by events. Sunak said the budget would be used to set out how the government would support jobs and the economy through the next phase of the pandemic. The message from the latest ONS data is that the economy could rebound quickly once restrictions on activity are lifted. The message from the chancellor is that it may take some time before that happens."
2021-02-12T09:03:09Z,business,Business,KPMG's Bill Michael resigns after telling staff to 'stop moaning',"KPMG’s UK chair, Bill Michael, has resigned after telling staff to “stop moaning” during a virtual meeting about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, where he also called unconscious bias “crap”.
Michael, who has headed the company since 2017, was speaking at a virtual town hall meeting on Monday with members of the firm’s financial services consulting team when he made the comments. The 52-year-old Australian, who told staff to stop “playing the victim card” and described the concept of unconscious bias as being “complete and utter crap for years”, apologised and said on Friday the scandal over his comments had made his position at the accounting giant “untenable”. Michael said: “I love the firm and I am truly sorry that my words have caused hurt among my colleagues and for the impact the events of this week have had on them. In light of that, I regard my position as untenable and so I have decided to leave the firm. It has been a privilege to have acted as chair of KPMG. I feel hugely proud of all our people and the things they have achieved, particularly during these very challenging times.” Pressure on Michael over his comments had increased during the week, as more details emerged of what he said to staff in the online meeting, which was attended by about a third of the 1,500-strong team. On Wednesday, Michael, who was paid £1.7m last year, stepped aside after the accounting company launched an independent investigation, run by the City law firm Linklaters, as the scandal erupted when his comments at the virtual meeting were made public.
During the call, Michael, who was admitted to hospital with Covid-19 in March last year, apologised to staff who had criticised his choice of words. He also later apologised in a separate email to all members of the consulting team. However, his apology was not enough to prevent insiders leaking details of his comments, including a video that was published by Mail Online. In the video, Michael said: “There is no such thing as unconscious bias, I don’t buy it. Because after every single unconscious bias training that has ever been done, nothing’s ever improved.” Employees shared their shock at his comments in the app used to run the event. The Guardian has seen screenshots of some of these comments, where several staff expressed their disappointment at Michael’s words. One worker wrote: “There’s no such thing as unconscious bias?! Are you joking? Please do your research before just making such statements. Check your privilege.” KPMG said that it would undertake a “leadership election” to replace Michael in due course. It had previously brought in two female partners to temporarily replace Michael while his comments were investigated. The senior elected board member Bina Mehta has stepped into the role of acting UK chair, while Mary O’Connor has become the senior partner. It is the first time that either role has been occupied by a woman in the 150-year history of the firm. “Bill has made a huge contribution to our firm over the last 30 years, especially over the last three years as chairman, and we wish him all the best for the future,” Mehta said. Michael’s departure was no surprise, after he failed to meet the standard required of leaders, said Gemma McCall, the chief executive of Culture Shift, a software business that helps organisations to monitor and prevent bullying and harassment. “Leaders really do need to take heed and exceed expectations when it comes to creating safe and supported environments for all employees,” McCall said. “Organisations should absolutely be putting equality, diversity and inclusion at the heart of their practices and this should be coming from board level down.”"
2021-02-12T08:33:13Z,business,Business,UK economy hit by record slump in 2020 but double-dip recession avoided,"Britain’s economy experienced its biggest annual decline in 300 years in 2020 amid the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic but will avoid a double-dip recession, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 9.9% in 2020, as no sector of the economy was left unscathed by lockdowns and plummeting demand during the pandemic. It was the biggest fall in annual GDP since the Great Frost of 1709, when the economy shrank by 13%. However, the latest figures showed the economy narrowly avoided a double-dip recession, with growth of 1% in the final quarter of the year, surpassing expectations earlier in the autumn for a renewed fall in GDP as the pandemic worsened. Looser Covid restrictions in the run-up to Christmas enabled the economy to grow at a monthly rate of 1.2% in December, after a 2.3% fall in November during the second English lockdown. Far surpassing the damage caused by the 2008 financial crisis, the annual drop in output caused by the Covid-19 emergency narrowly exceeded a 9.7% decline in 1921, when Britain was recovering from the first world war and the Spanish flu pandemic.
Pubs, bars and restaurants were able to recover some lost ground, and retail sales improved in December after the November lockdown ended and before tougher measures were imposed. Growth was also fuelled by a rise in healthcare activity, mainly because of coronavirus test-and-trace schemes across the UK. Analysts said companies adapting to restrictions by shifting their working patterns and altering their business models – including a boom in online shopping, and pubs and restaurants operating takeaways – helped to keep the economy growing late in 2020 despite increasingly tough public health restrictions. Output in the accommodation and food services sector – which includes hotels and restaurants – fell by a third in the fourth quarter overall but fared better than in the first lockdown, when the country came to a near standstill.
With looser coronavirus restrictions than last spring, output in the services sector – which makes up 80% of the economy – grew by 0.6%. Largely allowed to stay open, industrial production and manufacturing activity also grew, returning closer to pre-pandemic levels. The UK economy shrank for two successive quarters in the first half of last year, meeting the technical definition of a recession. The economy shrank by 2.9% in the first quarter of 2020, when the pandemic first spread to the UK, before a record 19% fall in the subsequent quarter during the spring lockdown. The economy then grew at a record 16.1% in the third quarter, fuelled by the summer reopening of the hospitality sector, before the second wave of the pandemic forced the launch of renewed restrictions. Economists forecast a renewed plunge in the opening months of 2021, meaning a drop in the fourth quarter of 2020 would have marked the first step into a double-dip recession, defined as two recessions following each other in quick succession.
The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the latest figures showed Britain’s economy had experienced a “serious shock” as a result of the pandemic. “While there are some positive signs of the economy’s resilience over the winter, we know that the current lockdown continues to have a significant impact on many people and businesses,” he said. “That’s why my focus remains fixed on doing everything we can to protect jobs, businesses and livelihoods. At the budget I will set out the next stage of our plan for jobs, and the support we’ll provide through the next phase of pandemic.” Although the economy has avoided a double-dip recession, analysts said it was probably shrinking at the start of the year, with the toughest Covid lockdown restrictions since the first wave weighing down activity. The government is under mounting pressure to set out its roadmap for relaxing lockdown and fresh economic support measures for businesses and workers reeling from a year of disruption. Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, said Britain had recorded the highest death toll in Europe and among the worst declines of any major economy. “Businesses can’t wait any longer. The chancellor needs to come forward now with a plan to secure the economy in the months ahead, with support going hand in hand with health restrictions,” she said. Britain’s annual economic decline was the worst in the G7. GDP fell by 3.5% in the US, by 5% in Germany, 8.3% in France and 8.9% in Italy. The Canadian economy is forecast to have shrunk by 5%, and Japan’s by about 5.6%. However, the UK fared better than Spain, where the economy collapsed by 11% last year."
2021-02-12T00:44:57Z,business,Business,"British families ready to spend billions, says Bank of England's Haldane","British families are ready to fuel a rapid return to prosperity with a multibillion-pound spending spree, according to a senior Bank of England policymaker. With the vaccine rollout protecting more than 13 million of the most vulnerable people, the BoE’s Andy Haldane said the economy was about to turn “a decisive corner with enormous amounts of pent-up financial energy waiting to be released, like a coiled spring”. Echoing comments made by BoE governor Andrew Bailey last weekend, Haldane – the Bank’s chief economist – said most people were desperate to socialise again and spend money on going out for meals. By June, those Britons who have seen their incomes remain much the same but their spending plummet during three lockdowns will have amassed £250bn in savings, equivalent to 20% of the amount households spend each year.
Writing in the Daily Mail on Friday, Haldane said the Bank had conservatively estimated around 5%. “I think there is the potential for much more, perhaps even most, of this savings pool to leak into the economy, fuelling a faster recovery,” he said. “Why? Because people are not just desperate to get their lives back, but also to catch up on the social lives they have lost over the past 12 months.” The central bank recently cut its forecast for growth in the first quarter of the year to take account of the third lockdown. It said the economy would shrink by 4.25% between January and March as shops closed and people were advised to stay at home. But it upgraded the outlook for the second half of the year as vaccinations allow the economy to return to brisk growth and said the recovery would be complete by March 2022. Rival forecasters have been more circumspect and have estimated a slower recovery, more like the five years Britain took to climb back from the 2008 financial crash. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research said earlier this week that growth would be tepid while many workers feared they might lose their jobs, wages growth remained low and businesses held back investment. Haldane dismissed these concerns, saying: “The potential for a savings-led boost to demand is not confined to households. “While many companies have faced difficult times over the past year, a significant number have amassed a war-chest of cash, currently running at around £100bn. Will this be spent?
“Business investment has been laid low over recent years by the uncertainties around first Brexit and latterly Covid. “But with the risks from both now diminishing fast, and with consumer demand set to rise rapidly, the conditions are in place for businesses to splash some of their cash, too. “That would be good news for jobs, helping to recover some of the million lost so far in this crisis.”"
2021-02-11T19:55:45Z,business,Business,Shell strategy looking like a bundle of compromises | Nils Pratley,"Shell billed its net zero by 2050 plan as an “acceleration” of strategy, which was a generous self-assessment. In today’s big oil terms, the approach is a cruise down the middle lane – a tweak here and there, but nothing to frighten those shareholders still scarred by last year’s cut of two-thirds in the dividend. The company plans to reduce oil output by only 1%-2% a year until 2030, which compounds to an overall reduction of about 15% in the period. BP opted for 40% cut in oil and gas by 2030. Including gas, Shell’s production may be flat. On renewables, Shell’s numbers are relatively small. The investment budget will be $2bn-$3bn (£1.45bn-£2.15bn) a year for the “near term,” versus $8bn for the upstream oil and gas division. Admittedly, Shell is ahead of BP in terms of installed renewables capacity, but the latter is planning to build or buy 50 gigawatts of green energy production this decade, which is a chunky investment. Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, didn’t put it so starkly, but it looks as if the board has decided prices in offshore wind and solar are too frothy to chase. That judgment may be correct: BP stunned rivals this week with the prices it paid for the right to place windfarms in the Irish Sea. But it means Shell’s greener strategy rests heavily on “value chain” exercises such as rolling out electric vehicle charging points from 60,000 today to half a million by 2025. That is a case of exploiting the brand, as opposed to trickier stuff like converting deep-water expertise into technological innovation. It all counts, Shell might argue, since 90% of its emissions are the “scope 3” ones produced by customers. True, but it also feels meek. Shell’s shareholder base is deeply divided about the costs and opportunities of net zero: a few want faster transition, some cling to the oily income they know. The result is a strategy that looks like a bundle of compromises. Investors, for a change, will get a vote on the plan. Very good – just don’t expect enthusiasm. No need to fret over AstraZeneca A worry for AstraZeneca shareholders was that the time and energy spent on Covid-19 vaccines for no profit (at least until the pandemic stage is over) would distract from the day job. There was no need to fret. Thursday’s full-year numbers showed sales up 10% to $26.6bn and core earnings 18% higher, with newer medicines, as promised, doing the heavy lifting. Yes, AstraZeneca can do Covid and cancer at the same time. The chief executive, Pascal Soriot, may also have a future as a diplomat. It was only two weeks ago, remember, that the quarrel with the European commission over delays to vaccine deliveries looked nasty. AstraZeneca was being painted as a scapegoat – completely unfairly, according to most lawyers who read the “best efforts” terms of the contract – for the commission’s sluggish negotiation last year. The danger now seems to have passed. A peace deal of sorts was signed this week when AstraZeneca enlisted the German drug manufacturer IDT Biologika to produce the next generation of Covid vaccines, with a push to speed up the current round. That was always the obvious way to resolve the mini-crisis – actually build more capacity. Almost simultaneously, Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president, has started talking about how “mistakes were made” by Brussels in vaccine procurement. AstraZeneca would be foolish to boast, but it’s been vindicated. Neatly done. Glass half full at Marston’s That’s how to see off a cheeky takeover bid from private equity: say no, say it firmly, and wait for the capitulation. At the pub company Marston’s, it has taken only nine days for Platinum Equity to retreat after being told its £690m, or 105p-a-share, proposal “very significantly undervalues” the business. The key was Marston’s board’s insistence that the pre-pandemic share price should be the reference point for valuation. In other words, a 19% discount was not even close to a full pint, especially as the brewing business has since been merged into a promising joint venture with Carlsberg. Ignoring the pandemic’s impact won’t work for every company on the receiving end of an opportunistic offer, but Marston’s stance was correct. Pubs – at least, those that get through to the other side – should bounce back when they’re allowed to reopen. The punters are gasping."
2021-02-11T18:20:17Z,business,Business,"Last ever Learjet will be built this year, Bombardier says ","The last ever Learjet will be built in 2021, its manufacturer, Bombardier, has announced, signalling the end for an aircraft that was once shorthand for the luxury private jet travel of the super-rich. Sales of new Learjets have dwindled as ever-wealthier customers have started to demand even bigger, more comfortable private planes to carry them further around the world. The Learjet, the creation of the US inventor Bill Lear, was modelled on a Swiss fighter aircraft and allowed up to eight people to travel in comparative luxury – although not to stand upright in the jet’s small cabin. About 3,000 planes have been built since the first Learjet 23 flew in 1963. Bombardier acquired the Learjet company in 1990 but has announced it will discontinue the model to focus on its other business jet models, the Global and Challenger series. Eric Martel, the chief executive of the Canadian manufacturer, told analysts that the decision had been made as part of a cost-cutting rplan designed to save $400m (£290m) a year by 2023, including the loss of 1,600 jobs. “Passengers all over the world love to fly this exceptional aircraft and count on its unmatched performance and reliability. However, given the increasingly challenging market dynamics, we have made this difficult decision to end Learjet production,” he said.
Bombardier said it would continue to support and maintain existing Learjets, and would offer upgrades to avionics and interiors at the Learjet factory in Wichita in the US after the production line closes. The company delivered almost 20% fewer business jets in 2020, down to 114 aircraft. While private jet travel has fared better than commercial airlines during the coronavirus pandemic, the price of larger private jets on the secondhand market has dropped, making it ever harder for the firm to sell a new $10m-$14m Learjet. The Learjet’s six-decade run will come to an end just before that of a slightly younger, equally famous and substantially larger American model, the Boeing 747. Boeing announced last year that production of its jumbo jet would cease in 2022, with airlines such as British Airways retiring the plane owing to vanishing demand for long-haul flights."
2021-02-11T18:07:17Z,business,Business,Slow rollout of Covid vaccines in Europe delaying rebound in oil demand â€“ IEA,"A rebound in the world’s appetite for oil has been delayed by the sluggish rollout of coronavirus vaccines across Europe, according to the International Energy Agency. The global oil market watchdog said a recovery in oil demand would be “fragile” in the first half as the year, before a rebound in the second half as economies begin to return to normal. Oil demand is on track to decrease by 1m barrels a day in the first quarter compared with the end of 2020, when demand was already far lower because of the economic fallout of the pandemic. IEA, which advises major world economies, said: “Renewed lockdowns, stringent mobility restrictions and a rather slow vaccine rollout in Europe have delayed the anticipated [oil demand] rebound.” But the second half of the year will look brighter for oil producers, according to the Paris-base agency’s latest monthly oil report. It predicted oil demand would climb this year by 5.4m barrels a day to daily average of 96.4m barrels. This is still below the pre-pandemic peak of almost 100m barrels a day. Higher oil prices are also highly likely in the second half of the year as the Opec continues to keep a tight lid on production, according to the IEA report.
The cartel of 23 major producing nations has agreed to stick to a supply pact struck in the depths of the oil market crash last year while its de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, cuts its production by a further 1m barrels a day. The scheme has helped oil prices climb to more than $60 (£43) a barrel, up from less than $20 a barrel when oil demand hit historical lows. This is despite faltering demand. The combination of higher oil prices and Opec production limits will mean a brighter outlook for non-members and its allies, the IEA said, including Canadian and US shale oil producers."
2021-02-11T17:58:32Z,business,Business, 'Unconscious bias is utter crap': KPMG staff share shock at UK chair's Zoom comments ,"New details have emerged of controversial comments by the UK chair of KPMG, who has stepped aside while the accounting firm investigates what he said to staff during a virtual meeting. A video of the Zoom meeting was published on Thursday in which Bill Michael describes the concept of unconscious bias as being “complete and utter crap for years”. In the video, obtained by Mail Online, the 52-year-old Australian, who was paid £1.7m in 2020, said: “There is no such thing as unconscious bias, I don’t buy it. Because after every single unconscious bias training that has ever been done, nothing’s ever improved.” Michael added: “So unless you care, you actually won’t change. And I think there is a lot more care, more generally, to change, and we are in a very lucky sector.” Michael’s comments emerged on Tuesday after employees complained that he had told them to “stop moaning” about the impact of the pandemic on their lives and to stop “playing the victim card”. Members of the firm’s 1,500-strong financial services consulting team who took part in the meeting shared their shock at his comments. The Guardian has seen screenshots of some of these comments. Several employees expressed “disappointment” at Michael’s words as they commented anonymously on the session in an app used to run the event. One worker wrote: “There’s no such thing as unconscious bias?! Are you joking? Please do your research before just making such statements. Check your privilege.”
Michael, who was hospitalised with Covid-19 in March last year, rejoined the call and apologised to staff who had criticised his choice of words, later emailing an apology to the full team. It is also understood that Michael told a staff session that he was still meeting clients for coffee, despite Covid lockdown restrictions. KPMG has launched an independent investigation into Michael’s comments, which is being conducted by City law firm Linklaters. While the investigation takes place, Michael has been temporarily replaced by two female partners. Bina Mehta has stepped into the role of chair, while Mary O’Connor has taken on the role of senior partner. It is the first time that either role has been occupied by a woman in the 150-year history of the firm. KPMG, as well as the other big four accountancy firms, PwC, EY and Deloitte, all hold unconscious bias training sessions for their staff. The training is designed to make employees aware of patterns of discrimination and prejudice, and is mandatory for workers at many large organisations as a way of trying to combat prejudice on the grounds of race, sex, sexuality or disability. A KPMG UK spokesperson stated the company’s commitment to unconscious bias training, as well as to a range of training programmes to discuss bias and micro-aggressions. “We are fully committed to ensuring that KPMG’s working environment is inclusive and a place where all our people can reach their full potential, regardless of their identity, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation or socio-economic background,” KPMG said. Dr Maja Korica, an associate professor of organisation and management at Warwick business school, said Michael’s behaviour was “incredibly disappointing” and “indicates a lack of connection and perspective … Wisdom in leadership means knowing this for a fact and putting in place structures to ensure your disconnect doesn’t work against you or against the organisation,” she said. Raph Mokades, the managing director of the diversity recruitment specialist Rare, which provides companies with training software, said Michael’s comments suggested unconscious bias training alone was not enough to improve workplace diversity. “Unconscious bias training alone is never going to work, you need clear statements from leadership,” Mokades said. “Leadership has a clear role to play in setting the tone, talking specifically about race, racism what is unacceptable and what the penalties for unacceptable behaviour are and ensuring that senior leadership are all on top of the data in their own areas”.
What was said Bill Michael, KPMG UK chair: “Now is the time to say: do you care enough? Right, I don’t think this point of, what do you call it, unconscious bias? I think unconscious bias is complete crap, complete and utter crap for years, it really is. There is no such thing as unconscious bias, I don’t buy it. Because after every single unconscious bias training that has ever been done, nothing’s ever improved. “So unless you care, you actually won’t change. And I think there is a lot more care, more generally, to change, and we are in a very lucky sector. “Take as much influence of your own diary, of your own life, whatever. Because I have spoken to a lot of partners and people at all sorts of levels, where it almost feels like this is being done to them. Well you can’t play the role of victim unless you’re sick, and I hope you’re not sick, and you’re not ill, take control of your life and don’t sit there and moan about it, quite frankly.” Anonymous staff comments: “There’s no such thing as unconscious bias?! Are you joking? Please do your research before just making such statements. Check your privilege.” “Did Bill Michael say unconscious bias is just crap?! Herein lies the issue … Whilst the training may not be effective, to say it doesn’t exist is wreckless [sic].” “Quite disappointed by Bill Michael.” “This isn’t the first, second, or third time that Bill Michael has made such insensitive, throwaway comments. Our UK chairman is telling us who he is … Believe him.”"
2021-02-11T17:58:17Z,business,Business,Amsterdam overtakes London as Europe's top share trading centre,"Amsterdam has overtaken London as Europe’s largest share trading centre, and experts say the symbolic blow could be followed by the City losing jobs as well as more business owing to Brexit. The Dutch capital, which was previously the sixth largest exchange centre in Europe, saw average daily trading surge from €2.6bn (£2.3bn) to €9.2bn in January as exchanges shifted order books abroad after Brexit. It pushed London into second place, with average daily trading halving from €17.5bn to €8.6bn last month, according to data released by the CBOE exchange. Under European rules that pre-date Brexit, EU shares traded in euros must be traded on EU exchanges or in countries with special “equivalence” status. After Britain failed to gain equivalence with the EU or strike a comprehensive trade deal covering financial services, exchange operators such as the CBOE and Turquoise had to move their order books abroad by January 2021. While the figures are large, the overall impact on the City is small. Only a handful of jobs at the exchanges have had to move and the overall tax benefits to Amsterdam from a low-margin business such as trading will be minimal, according to Nick Bayley, a managing director at the consultancy Duff & Phelps. “In terms of jobs, tax revenues, other revenues, the profit and loss accounts and so on being generated in Holland rather than in the UK, it’s marginal. But it is symbolic, of course,” Bayley said. The change can be compared to moving a computer that processes online store orders from one city to another. While the computer has moved, all of its customers and suppliers are still in the same place. Likewise, while share trading has shifted, most of the traders, brokers and asset managers are still in London. “It’s a technological switch or regulatory switch, but it’s not some sort of seismic shift where suddenly people think London isn’t as attractive of a place to do business or London is doomed as a financial centre,” said William Wright, the founder of the New Financial thinktank. Roughly 20% of Britain’s financial services industry is related to EU clients and euro operations, Wright said, while more than half is focused on domestic UK customers. “It’s not going anywhere,” he added. Even if half of the City’s EU-related business eventually moves, that would account for only 10% of the financial centre’s business, which could shave 1% off the £76bn contributed by the industry to the Treasury last year. “The fact that the government has just spent nearly £300bn on its response to Covid, a £7bn loss suddenly doesn’t seem like such a big number. I don’t want to minimise the impact, but I think we need to keep it in perspective,” Wright said. However, UK authorities should still be “alive to the risk” that the City loses more than share trading, he added. There was further evidence of business moving away from the City on Thursday when a survey showed that trading of euro-denominated swaps in London – a form of insurance against moves in currencies and interest rates – accounted for just 10% of the market last month, down from nearly 40% in July. Experts said bigger changes could result in jobs moving away from the City. The accountancy firm Deloitte said the UK should be concerned about whether the EU would continue to recognise London clearing houses – which facilitate trading of financial assets – after an 18-month grace period, and whether it would allow fund managers to handle EU assets from within the UK. “These are things that are not going to be solved in the next six months but are definitely things we have to watch out for over the next few years, which are, I think, more likely to shift jobs than the share trading,” said Alex Szmigin, a partner in the risk advisory arm of Deloitte. Euro-denominated share trading is not expected to return to London, according to the chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority, Steven Maijoor. “I would suspect that this is going to be a permanent change in terms of movement of trading from the UK to the EU,” he said on Thursday.
Even if the government clinches an equivalence deal for financial services – where the UK and EU recognise each other’s regulatory standards – it does not provide long-term certainty for firms, since it can be revoked with just 30 days’ notice.
Meanwhile, the EU’s finance chief said on Thursday that Brussels would strive for close cooperation with Britain on financial services but London could not expect “equivalence-based” access to the EU financial market if it diverged widely on rules. “While the issue of equivalence is an area which we will discuss with the United Kingdom progressively, taking into account the UK’s regulatory intentions on a case-by-case basis, there cannot be equivalence and wide divergence,” Mairead McGuinness, the EU financial services commissioner, told an online event."
2021-02-11T15:21:36Z,business,Business,Ikea to expand consumer banking services after deal with Ikano Bank,"Ikea is planning to offer more consumer banking services in-store and online after announcing it is taking a 49% stake in its financial services partner, Ikano Bank. The furniture retailer’s parent company, Ingka Group, said this was “a decisive step into financial services” that would “help make Ikea more affordable, accessible and sustainable”. Ikea’s parent said the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, brought it a step closer to fulfilling its ambition of being a bigger player in financial services. In a statement the firms said the move would “maximise the potential of the existing relationship” and mean that financial products and services could be offered online and in-store. There are already close links between the two companies: the Ikano group was originally part of Ikea but was spun off in 1988 as an independent firm, though it is still owned by the Kamprad family, who founded the retailer. Ikano Bank has been operating in the UK since 1994, and as well as offering its own-branded financial products such as savings accounts direct to the public, it provides some of Ikea’s consumer finance such as its store card, in-store interest-free credit and loans. Ikano Bank also runs store cards for other retailers such as New Look and Oasis. At the moment, PayPal provides Ikea’s online interest-free credit offer in the UK. Based in Luxembourg, Ikano’s UK division is located in Nottingham and claims to have provided finance “to millions of UK customers”. It provides easy-access and fixed-rate savings accounts, and in the past has been a big player in personal loans, though its website said it was not offering new loans. The Ikano Bank UK website claims that “you won’t see us travelling first-class, having big corporate lunches or taking massive bonuses”.
Krister Mattsson, the managing director of Ingka’s investments arm, said: “The significant investment in Ikano Bank is an exciting step … into the banking sector.” Full financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Ingka said it was acquiring the stake through the issue of new shares by Ikano Bank, with the option to acquire the remaining 51% at a later date. Ikano Bank was a member of the Swedish Deposit Insurance Scheme, though since 1 January this year, the savings of UK customers have been protected up to £85,000 per person by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme."

The major European stock markets are also pushing higher, while the FTSE 100 index in London is flat. Bitcoin, the world’s best-known cryptocurrency, jumped more than 8% to a new all-time high of $48,481 after Bank of New York Mellon said that it will begin financing bitcoin and other digital currencies. AstraZeneca expects to double monthly production of its Covid-19 vaccine to 200m by April, from more than 100m now. Its target is to make 3bn doses this year, with India’s Serum Institute manufacturing a big chunk for poorer countries. Unlike some rivals such as Pfizer, AstraZeneca is supplying the vaccine at cost during this pandemic. Britain’s biggest drugmaker and Oxford university want to adapt the vaccine to tackle new Covid-19 strains and hope to have a new jab available by the autumn. The vaccine remains effective against the original virus and at least one variant, first discovered in Kent, England. But preliminary findings in a small-scale trial prompted South Africa to limit its use while it ascertains its efficacy against the variant that emerged there. AstraZeneca also released strong 2020 results, with sales hitting nearly $27bn, boosted by its cancer treatments.
The European Commission said it sees “light at the end of the tunnel” after a tough winter. It is predicting that the euorozone and EU economies will return to their pre-crisis levels of output earlier than expected in the autumn, assuming that the rollout of coronavirus vaccines will allow governments to relax restrictions in the spring. But Brexit will damage the economic recovery, costing the EU 0.5% of economic growth and the UK more than four times as much, 2.25%, by the end of next year, Brussels warned. Royal Mail delivered more parcels than ever during the Christmas quarter of the year amid lockdowns across the UK, but the company apologised for disruptions to service that it blamed on Covid-19 absences.
Shell has vowed to accelerate its plan to become a net-zero carbon energy company by 2050, but will continue to grow its gas business by more than 20% in the next few years.

2021-02-11T09:40:22Z,business,Business,Shell to expand gas business despite pledge to speed up net zero carbon drive,"Shell has set new carbon emissions goals to become a net zero carbon energy company by 2050, but will continue to grow its gas business by more than 20% in the next few years. The Anglo-Dutch oil company’s new climate strategy will include a modest fall in oil production, by selling oilfields or through the natural decline of their reserves, and an increase in gas production and gas exports to the global market. Shell’s goal is to be net zero carbon company within 30 years, including the emissions from burning its fossil fuels. But the plans have raised concerns among green campaigners that Shell may still increase its emissions in the coming decade, which is considered a crucial period to avoid a climate catastrophe. The company said its oil production reached a peak in 2019, and would continue to fall by 1-2%. But it will expand its capacity to export 33.3m tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) a year, by another 7m tonnes a year by the middle of the decade. In contrast, BP has promised to cut its oil and gas production by 40% by 2030. Shell plans to offset its own emissions and those from the fossil fuels it sells through carbon capture projects and “nature-based solutions” such as planting trees or restoring natural habitats. The company is involved in three capture projects, one of which is operational, that will be able to capture 4.5m tonnes of carbon a year. It hopes increase its access to these schemes by more than five-fold so it can capture another 25m tonnes of carbon a year by 2035. The company has also promised to grow its green energy business to help meet its customers demand for low-carbon energy. The plan includes growing its network of electric vehicle charge points from more than 60,000 to 500,000 by 2025. It also promised to invest more in hydrogen, which can be used as a clean-burning gas in industry and transport, and to double its sales of electricity. Ben van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive, said the plan would “drive down carbon emissions” and deliver “value for our shareholders, our customers and wider society” while continuing to use the company’s “established strengths”. Van Beurden assured investors the plan would create “more predictable cashflows” and help to generate higher returns. This would help the company to grow its dividends by 4% a year, and reduce the company’s net debt to $65bn (£47bn). But the plan has attracted criticism from green groups for being vague on Shell’s clean energy aims and unambitious on carbon emissions targets. Shell’s carbon targets for the next 14 years, which will help determine executive pay, will be based on the “carbon intensity” of its energy. This is not the same as the absolute emissions created, and means Shell could lower its carbon intensity by selling more clean energy alternatives without reducing the amount of fossil fuels produced. Shell promised to reduce its net carbon intensity by between 6% to 8% by 2023, compared with 2016, which would widen to 20% by 2030 and 45% in 2035 before reaching an absolute emissions cut of 100% by 2050. Jeanne Martin, a senior campaign manager at Shareaction, said the plan raised “a lot of red flags”. “It continues to rely on weak intensity targets, targeting just 20% reduction in intensity by 2030, not absolute emissions, and is essentially kicking the difficult decisions into the long grass,” she said.
Greenpeace described Shell’s decision to avoid tough oil production cuts by allowing its reserves to dwindle as “grotesque”. Mel Evans, a senior Greenpeace campaigner, said: “Without commitments to reduce absolute emissions by making actual oil production cuts, this new strategy can’t succeed nor can it be taken seriously.” The consensus among equity market analysts was that Shell’s investment and fossil fuel production plans were broadly in line with its existing strategy. Analysts at Jefferies said the strategy did not introduce significant changes in Shell’s energy transition strategy and that the company’s emissions targets remained “partially unclear, based on the limited low-carbon growth targets provided”."
2021-02-11T08:42:11Z,business,Business,AstraZeneca says vaccine against new Covid variants may take six months,"AstraZeneca has said it could take between six and nine months to produce Covid-19 vaccines that are effective against new variants of the coronavirus, and begin administering them to the public. The company’s vaccine, developed jointly with scientists at the University of Oxford, remains effective against the original virus and at least one variant, first discovered in Kent, England. But preliminary findings in a small-scale trial prompted South Africa to limit its use while it ascertains its efficacy against the variant that emerged there. A six-month turnaround for an updated vaccine would represent a vast improvement over traditional vaccine development timelines. “Work on the variants hasn’t started today, it started weeks and months ago, as soon as those new variants were identified and … we are aiming to be in the clinic in the spring, with next generation vaccines for the new variants,” said Sir Mene Pangalos, executive vice-president, BioPharmaceuticals R&D at AstraZeneca. Pangalos added that the jabs could be available to the public by the autumn, assuming the regulatory bodies are satisfied with using studies into the body’s immune response to the vaccine as the route to approval. A number of Covid vaccines have shown lower efficacy in trials where the South Africa variant predominates: earlier this week preliminary trials revealed the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab provided little protection against mild to moderate infection, although it is still expected to protect against severe disease and death. It has recently emerged that some cases of the Kent variant have a mutation also found in the South African variant, a development that scientists have cautioned needs to be taken seriously, not least since the mutation – known as E484K – has been linked to the ability for the South African variant to evade protection offered by some current Covid vaccines. Panaglos said tests need to be carried out on the Kent variant with the E484K mutation.
“It is quite possible that the vaccines we have today will still be protecting against all of the variants, for severe disease, hospitalisations and death,” he said, adding: “My assumption is that if we want to protect against mild disease as well, then vaccines that are targeting these new variants are likely to be more effective in the milder cases of the disease.” The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is particularly important for poorer countries, because the company – unlike some of its rivals such as Pfizer – has pledged to sell it at cost price. The vaccine also does not require very low temperatures during transport, making it cheaper to deliver. However the jab has been at the centre of a row over supplies, with the EU facing a shortfall of doses. Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca’s chief executive, defended the company’s record of delivering vaccines to the EU. “Within a month with our supply we are going to double the amount of vaccinations in Europe. If that’s not an achievement, what is?,” he said, referring to the 17m doses that are due to be delivered to the EU over the coming weeks. The team noted that 100m doses a month were currently being produced globally, and that this is expected to rise to 200m doses a month globally by April, with 336m doses expected to be available to 145 countries in the first half of the year through the Covax scheme, a mechanism to distribute Covid-19 doses fairly around the world. The AstraZeneca/Oxford University vaccine has now been approved for use in more than a quarter of countries around the world. Pam Cheng, executive vice-president of global operations & IT at AstraZeneca, said: “We [began] shipping to the EU last Friday and are on track to deliver the target doses in February, March and beyond.” Cheng added that a new partnership with IDT Biologika in Germany will further strengthen Europe’s vaccine supply capability for the longer term. Announcing its financial results for 2020 on Thursday, AstraZeneca said: “In collaboration with the University of Oxford, AstraZeneca is focused on adapting C19VAZ [its vaccine] to new disease strains if required and hopes to reduce the time needed to reach production at scale to between six to nine months, by utilising existing clinical data and optimising its established supply chain.” AstraZeneca will not incorporate revenues from the vaccine into its financial results, but it said 2020 performance in its main profit-making business remained strong.
Revenues for the final quarter of the year rose by 11% to $7.4bn (£5.3bn), and in 2020 overall revenues increased by 9% to $26.6bn, thanks in part to a 23% increase in sales of its cancer drugs. Covid-19 vaccine sales were just $2m. AstraZeneca made profit before tax of $3.9bn for 2020. Soriot said: “The performance last year marked a significant step forward for AstraZeneca. Despite the significant impact from the pandemic, we delivered double-digit revenue growth to leverage improved profitability and cash generation. “The consistent achievements in the pipeline, the accelerating performance of our business and the progress of the Covid-19 vaccine demonstrated what we can achieve.”"
2021-02-11T06:01:03Z,business,Business,Retailers call for more Covid help after £22bn loss in non-food sales,"Retailers are calling for more financial support from the government after the UK’s Covid lockdowns in 2020 cost £22bn in lost non-food sales. The high street was hit by its biggest fall in sales for non-food stores on record – down 24% – as footfall decreased by two-fifths, according to data from the trade body the British Retail Consortium (BRC). While many retailers continued to sell online, that did not make up for sales lost from shops. Profits were also affected by the cost of setting up and operating home delivery systems. Central London has been one of the hardest hit parts of the country; the loss of tourists and many commuters contributing to a surge in closures of shops and other high street businesses. The number of empty units in the City of London increased by 47% last year as the number of workers and visitors slumped, according to figures from analysts at Local Data Company. Takeaway food outlets, bars, pubs and coffee shops were among the most badly affected in the City, as well as specialist shirtmakers. However, the steep rise in empty high street outlets in the Square Mile still left it better off than the rest of England, Wales and Scotland, with 11.4% units vacant compared with 13.7%. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said: “After 2020 proved to be the worst year on record, it is essential that the chancellor uses the spring budget to support those businesses hardest hit by the pandemic. Vital support in the form of an extension to the business rates relief and moratorium on debt enforcement, as well as removing state aid caps on Covid business grants, would relieve struggling businesses of bills they cannot currently pay and allow them to trade their way to recovery.” Retailers have benefited from a rates holiday since last April, but are worried about the planned resumption of the tax this April. A moratorium on commercial evictions, which has protected struggling retailers, pubs and other high street businesses from being thrown out of premises if they are unable to pay rent, is also due to end next month. Dickinson said additional government financial assistance was needed to support the jobs of hundreds of thousands of retail workers.
The BRC’s latest call for action comes after business leaders, including those of Tesco, B&Q and Waterstones told the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, that the business rates burden on shops was putting thousands of high street jobs at risk and that online retailers should pay their fair share of tax. In a letter sent before next month’s budget, retailers and landlords said the current system was “not sustainable in the long term and without reform, shops at the heart of communities will be at risk”. Last year, the government launched a review of the business property tax, and is due to report back in the spring. The review is considering a variety of options including shifting the balance between online and physical shops by introducing a web sales tax."
2021-02-11T00:01:29Z,business,Business,"Half of UK exporters to EU are having Brexit difficulties, survey finds","Half of British exporters to the EU are facing difficulties with mounting Brexit red tape and border disruption after a month of the new rules, according to one of the most comprehensive business surveys since leaving the bloc. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said that 49% of UK-based exporters in a survey of 470 firms had suffered problems with post-Brexit arrangements since the start of the year, as companies struggled to adapt and faced higher costs due to extra border checks and paperwork. Little more than a month into the UK’s new relationship with Brussels, the leading business lobby group warned that urgent action from both the British government and the EU was necessary to solve severe issues with cross-border trade. It said UK companies were facing extra costs, delays in shipments to and from the continent, mountains of new paperwork and were often confused about whether particular rules applied to them or not. The findings came as pressure mounted on the government amid difficulties at the borders, with warnings that increasing trade volumes later in the year are likely to expose further problems with the system. Trade flows between the UK and the EU dropped below usual levels in January amid Brexit and Covid disruption, as well as after firms rushed to stockpile goods in December to beat the end of the transition period on 31 December. Boris Johnson has acknowledged there are “teething problems” a month into the new rules. However, business leaders said there would be a permanently higher cost of doing business even after initial complications subside. The BCC said about a third of companies in a survey of 1,000 firms conducted in late January had found difficulties adapting to changes to moving or trading goods in the first month of the year. As few as 10% said Brexit changes were easy to accommodate, while 45% said cross-border trade was not applicable to their business, and 16% said it was too early to say. However, among firms directly involved in exporting goods, half reported issues. As many as 51% of manufacturers also reported problems. Post-Brexit trading problems are hurting the business of AEV Group, a Merseyside-based specialist manufacturer of electrical insulating varnishes and resins, which has a plant in Hungary. Jonathan Kemp, managing director of the company, said the firm could be forced to reduce its operations in the UK and invest in the EU instead to avoid additional paperwork and costs. “We export to every continent in the world and have done for a period of time, therefore we have employees who are experienced in dealing with exports. The issue with the EU-UK situation is the lack of clarity and preparedness in all areas,” he said. The BCC said the situation could get worse within months if the UK goes ahead with implementing sanitary and phytosanitary checks on food from April and full customs controls on imports from July, at a time when businesses remain under pressure due to Covid-19. Adam Marshall, director general of the BCC, said these timescales need to change, and the support available for businesses significantly increased. “For some firms these concerns are existential, and go well beyond mere ‘teething problems’. It should not be the case that companies simply have to give up on selling their goods and services into the EU. Ministers must do everything they can to fix the problems that are within the UK’s own control, and increase their outreach to EU counterparts to solve the knotty issues that are stifling trade in both directions,” he said."
2021-02-10T20:18:25Z,business,Business,KPMG chair steps aside after telling staff to 'stop moaning' about pandemic,"KPMG has confirmed that its chairman is stepping aside after the accounting giant launched an investigation into controversial comments he made to staff in a virtual meeting this week. Bill Michael, who took over as chairman in 2017, told staff on Monday to “stop moaning” about the pandemic and the impact of lockdown on people’s lives, adding that they should stop “playing the victim card”. The online meeting was attended by around a third of the financial services consulting team’s 1,500 staff. Michael, who was in hospital with Covid-19 in March last year, later rejoined the call and apologised to staff who had criticised his choice of words in the comment section of the app used to run the event, according to the Financial Times which first reported the story. He also apologised in a separate email to all members of the consulting team. The chairman also reportedly told staff he was still holding client meetings despite Covid lockdown restrictions, and claimed unconscious bias was “complete crap”. The big four accounting firm has now launched an investigation into Michael’s comments, prompting him to step aside – at least temporarily – until KPMG completes its inquiry. A KPMG UK spokesperson said: “Following the meeting on 8 February, the firm initiated an independent investigation into the alleged comments in accordance with its usual procedures. “Mr Michael has decided to step aside from his duties as chair while the investigation is under way. We take this matter very seriously and will not comment further while the investigation is ongoing.” KPMG has asked one of its board members, Bina Mehta, to step in as chairman in the interim. In a statement released on Tuesday, before he stepped aside, Michael said: “I am sorry for the words I used, which did not reflect what I believe in, and I have apologised to my colleagues. Looking after the wellbeing of our people and creating a culture where everyone can thrive is of critical importance to me and is at the heart of everything we do as a firm.” KPMG declined to comment on whether Michael would continue being paid throughout the investigation. Michael was paid £1.7m last year, according to KPMG UK’s full-year results. That was despite taking a 14% pay cut after the firm suffered weaker demand for consulting and advisory services at the start of the pandemic. He earned nearly £2m in 2019. KPMG’s 582 partners – who account for its most senior staff – took an 11% pay cut in 2020 but still earned an average of £572,000 each."
2021-02-10T20:03:05Z,business,Business,Bank of England governor warns EU demands for City are ‘unrealistic’,"The governor of the Bank of England has called EU demands for City banks to comply with Brussels regulations unacceptable, in a combative speech backing the government’s hardline stance in the next round of Brexit talks. Andrew Bailey said the UK should refuse to allow Brussels to restrict how the UK industry develops and look instead to global financial regulators as the main rule makers. Calling the EU insistence on an equivalence regime out of line with all other deals signed by Brussels, the central bank head lined up with Boris Johnson as the UK embarks on what are expected to be difficult talks over the next few months. Speaking online at the annual Mansion House dinner to finance industry executives, Bailey said the EU had granted equivalence status – a mutual recognition of each side’s regulatory standards – to Canada, the US, Australia, Hong Kong and Brazil based on their adherence to international regulations, but was insisting that London also track the twists and turns of EU rules. “The EU has argued it must better understand how the UK intends to amend or alter the rules going forwards,” he said. “This is a standard that the EU holds no other country to and would, I suspect, not agree to be held to itself. It is hard to see beyond one of two ways of interpreting this statement, neither of which stands up to much scrutiny.” Bailey said the first interpretation was that the EU thought rules should never change, something that the governor said was “unrealistic, dangerous” and inconsistent with how the EU operated. Instead, he favoured the interpretation that the EU would only grant equivalence status if the UK agreed to change its rules whenever the EU did. “But that is rule-taking, pure and simple. It is not acceptable when UK rules govern a system 10 times the size of the UK GDP and is not the test up to now to assess equivalence.” During last year’s Brexit negotiations, the EU granted the UK’s financial services industry a six-month extension to the transition deal, which ended on 31 December. City bosses are braced for ministers to reject a deal should the EU maintain its demand that the UK should not change its rules independently. Bailey’s comments will bolster Johnson’s position in talks to seal a longer-term agreement, when the prime minister is expected to argue that Brussels is behaving unreasonably when it demands a commitment to amend City regulations in line with changes to EU rules. Bailey said the UK should take a more global view of the City’s future and seek to be involved in global regulatory bodies. He said the central bank already provided the chairs for two of the four main regulatory bodies and this put the UK in a strong position to influence industry rules. There was a message in Bailey’s speech for Brexiters who would prefer the UK to go it alone, with the governor warning that there would always need to be compromises to create a level playing field. “It requires us to give up some control over our standards and rules, because the alternative of narrow domestic control is illusory – it would jeopardise achieving the very things we want, safe open markets, and likewise open economies. Above all, these bodies enable us to build the trust that enable our financial systems to stay open,” he said. “But, we do not for a moment believe that we can maintain the arrangements we have without change. As the world around us changes, so too do we have to adapt how we achieve these public goods. “Also, we do not participate in these global institutions with the intention to water them down, misguidedly because we think this would preserve some notion of our competitiveness as a nation. The UK could not be a global financial centre for long if we did.” Bailey’s speech came as he found himself under pressure following a dispute over his handling of the London Capital & Finance (LC&F) collapse in his previous job as the main City regulator. Evidence he gave to MPs on Monday was questioned publicly the next day by the judge who headed an inquiry into LC&F, Dame Elizabeth Gloster."
2021-02-10T20:02:29Z,business,Business,The BoE governor makes sense about the EU but are politicians listening?,"Andrew Bailey, taking a day off from quarrelling with Dame Elizabeth Gloster over London Capital & Finance, gave a long list of reasons on Wednesday for why, in a rational world, it would be straightforward for the UK and the European Union to cooperate on financial services. This is important territory. Arrangements on financial services, which were excluded from last December’s Brexit trade deal, could dictate the future of the City for a decade. First, said the Bank of England governor in his speech at Mansion House, regional disagreements don’t make sense in a financial world that increasingly runs on global rules overseen by global bodies. Second, the UK’s standards already look more equivalent to the EU’s than those of Canada, the US, Australia, Hong Kong and Brazil, countries that have been awarded “equivalence” gold stars by Brussels. Third, it’s nonsense to expect equivalent to mean identical. The UK’s rules must govern a financial system 10 times the size of UK GDP, so local differences are to be expected – indeed, are essential. Fourth, the UK isn’t interested in creating “a low regulation, high risk, anything goes” financial system, so the EU shouldn’t worry about importing instability. They’re all fine arguments and Brussels clearly implicitly accepts a few. Temporary equivalence was granted last year in some areas for reasons of financial safety. If a deal – or even the memorandum of understanding due next month – was solely in the hands of financial technocrats, the temporary might become permanent. The problem, of course, is that politicians will decide. The big unknown is the EU’s appetite for cutting the City down to size, which is mostly about the ambitions of Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam. Bailey’s logic was impeccable. But, if the EU wants to insist that euro-denominated financial deals are cleared within the eurozone, that is now its call. No, a £40m CEO bonus isn’t OK Now we know: a £40m bonus for the chief executive of a FTSE 250 company is fine, or so most big shareholders in Future, the publishing house behind PC Gamer, Real Homes and Horse & Hound, believe. The contentious proposal to crank up potential rewards met a 36% rebellion, but a majority is a majority. Future’s plea that it is a special case worked. The company’s argument was that Zillah Byng-Thorne, the chief executive who will receive the splendid sum if five-year targets are achieved, has already overseen Future’s transformation from stock market straggler to £2bn operation. The company also congratulated itself that the rest of workforce, unusually, will be offered mini-jackpots. Fine, but almost every company can plead its position is exceptional in some way. The Restaurant Group, owner of Wagamama, thought its executives needed new incentives after the trading whack from lockdowns. At Cineworld, the cinema chain, it was a case of a show of force: the two brothers in charge were backed by a 20% family holding. Future’s proposal is less objectionable in the sense that the company is not starting with a battered share price, as conceded here last week. But Byng-Thorne’s package still equates to £8m a year at the maximum, a sum one used only to associate with companies halfway up the FTSE 100 ladder. This is boardroom pay inflation in action. And the timing – in the middle of an income-destroying (for some) pandemic – looks terrible. At least Chuka Umunna isn’t still an MP now he’s a banker Chuka Umunna will lead JP Morgan’s environmental, social and governance work in Europe, which sounds like a proper job, as opposed to the advisory gigs the Wall Street bank has handed out to Sajid Javid and Tony Blair. All the same, the appointment represents yet another trip down the well-travelled road between Westminster and the City. The regularity of such journeys feels unhealthy. Banking is a political business. A decade ago, the state was bailing out banks and introducing regulatory reforms. Soon the issue will be how hard lenders should chase the repayment of Covid loans – those underwritten by taxpayers and those where the banks are on the hook. In an ideal world, there’d be an unbridgeable career gap between lawmakers and banks. In practice, it’s probably impossible to place limits on where former politicians can work once they’ve left Westminster – and, at the age of 42, Umunna has to do something. Rather, the appointment that should have created a stink is Javid’s, since the former chancellor is still an MP. That arrangement ought to be strictly off-limits."
2021-02-10T18:22:10Z,business,Business,World's top 15 hedge fund managers made $23.2bn in total last year,"The year 2020 will go down in the record books as one of the worst in global history. Nearly 2 million people died from coronavirus , tens of millions more lost their jobs and countless others faced unprecedented disruption to their daily lives. However, it was a very profitable year for the elite few financial executives betting on the health of the global economy. The world’s top 15 hedge fund managers collectively made $23.2bn (£16.9bn) last year. That is the equivalent of more than six Marks & Spencers or more than the gross domestic product of Iceland or Zambia (population: 18 million). The best performing hedge fund manager, Chase Coleman III, the founder of Tiger Global Management (TGM), made $3bn in performance management fees and gains on his personal investment in the fund, according to a Bloomberg analysis of regulatory filings. Coleman’s personal pay last year was more than the GDP of dozens of countries including Gambia, Bhutan and Eritrea, according to the International Monetary Fund. It is thought to be the biggest single year’s pay for anyone since another hedge fund manager, John Paulson, made $5bn in 2010 betting on the recovery of the economy after the financial crisis. Coleman’s $3bn adds to the $4.5bn fortune he had already amassed, according to estimates by Forbes magazine, which had him ranked as the 458th richest person in the world. Coleman and his TGM fund made a lot of money from investing heavily in tech stocks including PayPal, Google-owner Alphabet, the fitness bike company Peloton and the remote-working winners Zoom and Slack. He was also an early investor in Facebook, which made his fund nearly $1bn. Coleman, 45, has been described by New York Magazine as having “the unique distinction of being both old and new money rich”. He is a descendant of Peter Stuyvestant — the last Dutch governor of New York and the person who ordered the building of the wall that Wall Street is named after. The name on his birth certificate is Charles Payson Coleman III. He got his start in hedge funds at 24 when Julian Robertson, the founder of Tiger Management, gave him $25m seed money to start Tiger Global. Coleman attracted Robertson’s attention as he was good friends with Robertson’s son Spencer, growing up in the wealthy Glen Head community on Long Island. In 2005 Coleman, who is a major donor to the Republican party, married Stephanie Ercklentz, the daughter of banker and industrialist Enno Ercklentz. She featured in the 2003 documentary film Born Rich, in which she said she gave up working for a living because it required “too many hours”. The couple, who have several homes, mostly live in a two-level whole floor apartment near Central Park in New York thought to be worth more than $100m. In 2018 they held a party during which the apartment was trashed ahead of a makeover, including spray painting the French plastered walls, according to New York Post gossip column Page Six. All of the 15 hedge fund managers on the 2020 high pay list are men. The second-highest paid was Jim Simons, the founder of Renaissance Technologies, who made $2.6bn. Third was Israel Englander of Millennium Management.
Also on the list is Bill Ackman, the founder and chief executive of Pershing Square Capital Management. Ackman, who according to the list made $1.3bn, made billions for his fund by betting that stock markets would collapse early on in the pandemic. Luke Hilyard, the executive director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, said: “The research shows the extraordinary riches accruing to a tiny number of individuals for speculative financial activities of dubious value to wider society. “It ought to be completely clear that this is a really terrible way for wealth to be distributed, in the midst of a global pandemic with families losing jobs and homes, businesses going under and public services under immense strain.”"

2021-02-10T17:29:01Z,business,Business,Future to introduce CEO bonus scheme despite shareholder revolt,"Future, the UK’s biggest magazine publisher, home to titles from Country Life and Total Guitar, is to introduce a controversial bonus scheme that could award its chief executive £40m, after a bruising shareholder vote in which almost 40% of investors failed to approve the plan. The board of Future, which in November struck a £594m deal to buy the comparison site GoCompare, weathered the shareholder revolt at its annual general meeting on Wednesday after a number of influential advisory services recommended investors voted to reject the new scheme. Almost 40% of shareholders voted against or withheld their vote, while the same proportion failed to back Future’s remuneration report for last year, which awarded the chief executive, Zillah Byng-Thorne, a £3.7m overall package and a 21% pay rise to £575,000. The new scheme proposes that all 2,300 employees will share in an annual pot of shares capped at £95m for three years as long as Future’s share price rises at least 10% a year from September 2020 to September 2025. The previous scheme only benefited the 50 most senior directors.
Byng-Thorne, who over the last six years has transformed Future from a business facing collapse to one with a market value of £1.8bn, is entitled to 14.3% of the pot up to an annual maximum of £13.6m. Almost 40% of Future shareholders also failed to back a new “value creation” plan, which is built on building synergies between its publishing business and GoCompare. Many of its titles, such as T3, make significant income when readers click-through to buy an item from a retailer partner after reading a review. The company’s board acknowledged the investor revolt but said the new share bonus policy and value creation plan recognised “the key role that all Future’s colleagues play in delivering our ambitious strategy”. “The value creation plan is directly aligned to shareholder interests by incentivising and rewarding exceptional performance and the sustained delivery of further significant increases in shareholder value,” the company said."
2021-02-10T17:06:04Z,business,Business,AstraZeneca to build new Covid-19 vaccine facility in Germany ,"AstraZeneca has unveiled plans to build a new Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing facility in partnership with IDT Biologika at the German firm’s Dessau site, in a move aiming to speed up production and defuse a row with the EU over supplies. IDT Biologika, one of AstraZeneca’s manufacturing partners, provides glass vials and injects the liquid vaccine – which is made at other European sites – into the vials, before capping and boxing them. The two companies said they were exploring options to speed up this process in the second quarter to help ramp up Europe’s vaccine rollout after a slow start to vaccination campaigns in EU countries amid supply shortages. They also plan to build up to five 2,000-litre bioreactors capable of making tens of millions of doses a month of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine. However, the new facility will not be up and running until the end of next year. The factory could also manufacture other vaccines that have a similar manufacturing process. Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca’s chief executive, said: “This agreement will greatly help Europe build an independent vaccine manufacturing capability that will allow it to meet the challenges of the current pandemic and create strategic supply capacity for the future.” The announcement came after European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, told MEPs that the EU was not where it wanted to be with its immunisation programme. Her remarks followed mounting criticism of the bloc’s slow deployment of the jabs.
The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker also revealed that it had begun delivering millions of doses of the vaccine it developed with University of Oxford to EU countries last Friday, as part of the initial 17m that are due to be delivered over the new few weeks, with more planned in March. Last month, the EU threatened to block exports of coronavirus vaccines to countries outside the bloc such as Britain after AstraZeneca said it could only deliver less than half as many doses as planned in the first quarter of 2021 because of problems at one of its European factories. The company then rowed back and increased future supplies, as well as bringing deliveries forward by one week. AstraZeneca received another boost on Wednesday as scientists advising the World Health Organization recommended the use of its vaccine in adults of all ages. There had been confusion over its effectiveness in people over 65."
2021-02-10T16:30:48Z,business,Business,Australia's climate policy is a mix of delusion and denial. We need to get real | Greg Jericho,"Right now the government is utterly hamstrung on the issue of climate change. After more than a decade of obstruction and doing the least possible, the rest of the world is changing fast and the debate in Australia needs to get real. As Katharine Murphy put it so well on Tuesday, the government has no real climate change policy to speak of, but they do have a hell of a lot of fighting over pretending that there is. Which is more abysmal – the farcical electric vehicles discussion paper that does not seek to reduce emissions, or the deputy prime minister suggesting agriculture be “carved out” from any net zero target that does not actually exist?
It is all a symptom of treating climate change as an issue that should be put off until later. To be honest, even the ALP is susceptible to this when it remains unwilling to commit to cutting emissions by 2030, out of a (probably correct) belief that any such target will be politically damaging. As I noted last week, pushing things off till later will not only require more drastic cuts, but that we will also quickly reach points where any cuts will not be enough to prevent temperatures from rising above either 1.5C or 2C above pre-industrial levels. And with the EU now exploring a carbon border tax, all those years of refusing to act and obstructing action to notionally protect our economy are about to cause a massive economic shock. Reducing that shock is going to need more than just suggesting we need to switch to wind and solar electric power. In late 2019, I suggested that politicians needed to start being honest about the difficulty of reducing emissions. I got some criticism from people within the ALP that such an approach is a good way to lose elections. And perhaps that is correct. But I am rather unwilling to support something inadequate merely because it is slightly less so than that proposed by the Coalition. Inadequate policy is not what is needed even in the best of times, and climate change right now is fast becoming the worst of times. The cost of climate change clearly and vastly outweighs the costs of reducing emissions, but that doesn’t mean doing so is easy. Alas the debate remains still one where politicians would have us believe we can achieve net zero by just doing the easy things – or that some sectors can be excused. The problem is all we have done thus far are the trouble-free things and have excused far too many.
Consider that if Scott Morrison came out today and said from 2023 onwards (to give the sector a bit of time to prepare) we will target zero electricity emissions by 2045. That would be excellent, but even though electricity is our biggest generator of emissions, reducing only that to zero would still have Australia emitting 388Gt C02 in 2045:

Graph not displaying? Click here Over the past decade, most focus at policy level has been on reducing electricity emissions, and as a result, emissions from other sectors have remained mostly flat or growing:
Graph not displaying? Click here The latest government projections have only electricity emissions falling by 2030, while the stationary energy, transport and agriculture sectors will increase emissions. The transport, agriculture and stationary energy (which is, for example, the emissions produced in manufacturing and construction) sectors are expected to grow from a combined 263Gt C02 in 2020 to 277Gt C02 in 2030 – a 5% increase in the next decade and some 13% above the 2005 levels. In reality, they should be at least 50% below 2005 levels by then. And this is what I mean by getting honest with people. No one notices where your electricity comes from when you switch on a light, but people will notice having to change the way they drive or commute; businesses will notice having to think about the transport of goods via trucks, what they emit when they manufacture products that we all will still want, and farmers will certainly notice having to change what they farm and how they do it. But the changes need to occur across all sectors – not least of because, as Peter Mailler pointed out, the agriculture industry will be the most directly affected by climate change (a fact only the National party seems unaware of) – but also because the longer we wait and the more exemptions we provide the harder the transition will be. If we aim to stay within the carbon budget that limits temperature rises to 2C above pre-industrial levels, our current path means after 2030 we would need to cut the equivalent of 17% of our current emissions each year – something we haven’t been able to do in the 15 years since 2005:
Graph not displaying? Click here Right now climate policy is a mix of delusion and denial – a hope that low-hanging fruit is all that needs to be picked, and that we can put off everything else till later. That needs to end now. Our economy and emissions are more than just electricity – and political parties that care about people’s lives should be doing all they can to help us all make the changes that need to be done."
2021-02-10T16:30:47Z,business,Business,Big-emitting Australian businesses could soon face costly carbon levy in Europe,"Big-emitting Australian businesses that export to Europe could soon face steep carbon levies of more than $70 a tonne unless the federal government imposes emissions reduction policies, according to a new analysis. A research note by climate and energy advisory firm RepuTex said a proposal for a “carbon border adjustment mechanism” by no later than 2023 made it clear companies that imported emissions-intensive industrial goods into the continent would soon need to buy carbon permits. The carbon tariff proposal was endorsed by the European parliament’s environment committee last week and is expected to form the basis for a European Commission policy due in June.
The cost on importers would be equivalent to that on the European carbon market, which is currently trading carbon permits at a record high A$60 a tonne of CO2 – more than twice the maximum price of the abolished Australian carbon scheme. The EU price is forecast to reach A$71 next year and up to $139 by 2030. Data compiled by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says Australia exported $11.7bn worth of goods to EU countries last financial year. Major exports included coal ($2.7bn), gold coin ($689m) and gold ($409m). RepuTex’s executive director, Hugh Grossman, said the EU tariff would initially apply to emissions-intensive products not on this list, such as steel, cement, chemicals and fertilisers, but eventually extend to all commodities covered by the EU carbon market. The objective was to ensure European industrial emitters were on a level playing field with competitors in other countries as the continent introduced more significant measures to address the climate crisis, he said. “It is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when,” Grossman said. “We know the timetable is 2023 and the proposal has support in Europe. The question now is just what Australia does to respond – whether it allows its industry to be exposed to these sorts of prices or takes action to address it.” Grossman said the European proposal would require other countries to have an emissions compliance system similar to its own to avoid the levy. That did not necessarily mean export businesses had to pay the same carbon price at home, but they would have to be part of a system that required emissions reductions and had equivalent climate goals for 2050 and possibly 2030. He said the Morrison government’s “technology, not taxes” approach of subsidies and research and development funding to encourage emissions cuts would not be enough. “An incentive-based framework, in our opinion, is not equivalent to a compliance-based framework,” he said. Tennant Reed, a climate adviser at the Australian Industry Group, agreed there was a strong likelihood carbon tariffs would be introduced. Beyond the EU, Joe Biden has promised a US “carbon adjustment fee against countries that are failing to meet their climate and environmental obligations” and the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, is considering using the G7 presidency this year to try to forge an alliance on carbon border taxes. But Reed disagreed with RepuTex that the EU plan was likely to have a significant short-term impact on Australian businesses as they did not sell steel and cement, the goods Europe was primarily focused on, to the continent.
Reed said the European emissions trading scheme did not currently apply to fugitive methane emissions released in coalmining, which would make it difficult to justify applying a tariff to Australia’s metallurgical coal exports, for use in steelmaking, under the World Trade Organization rules the EU had committed to follow. Agricultural exports, such as meat and wine, were also not likely to be hit. He said any industries charged a carbon tariff would not be disadvantaged against European producers of the same goods as both would face the same cost, but carbon-intensive exporters were likely to face reduced demand for their products. Australia’s metallurgical coal falls into this category. He said its use in the EU was likely to shrink given the continent was aiming to meet ambitious climate targets – including a 55% cut by 2030 compared with 1990 levels – and cleaner alternatives were starting to emerge. Reed said the biggest impact of the EU carbon tariff system on Australia may be to demonstrate where the world was headed. “It may be more relevant to us as a model to use in future rather than a risk we will be whacked by the [carbon tariff] stick,” he said. The push for carbon tariffs has increased as countries consider how to reach the increasingly shared goal of reducing emissions to net zero by 2050. More than 120 countries, including all G7 members, have some form of mid-century zero emissions goal. The Morrison government has resisted setting the target. Official government projections suggest emissions will fall by only 7% over the next decade, a period in which scientists say much more urgent action is needed. The new Australian trade minister, Dan Tehan, has said carbon tariffs were yet to be an issue in negotiations with the EU on a free trade deal, and criticised the idea “as a new form of protectionism”.
Experts have dismissed the idea carbon tariffs are a form of industry protection, saying the rationale is to level the playing field for local businesses acting to cut emissions. The EU emissions trading scheme initially allocated free permits to energy-intensive industrial businesses to protect them against competition from imports, but plans to phase this out as the continent makes deeper cuts to meet its new 2030 target. Its carbon price has increased significantly since 2015, from about A$11 to nearly A$60 a tonne. The EU carbon tariff proposal could require companies in other countries to measure the emissions intensity of their goods, or to use an estimate based on the global average emissions released in creating a product."
2021-02-10T16:29:19Z,business,Business,European office workers don’t expect to return before summer,"European office workers’ expectations about when they will be able to go back to their desks after the pandemic have slipped to the summer, according to a survey, as office return dates have been further delayed. Despite the coronavirus vaccination programme and lockdown restrictions, workers in five European countries including the UK now expect to work from home until June instead of April, according to research by the AlphaWise unit at the US bank Morgan Stanley. The further postponement of a return to the office came as the business software firm Salesforce joined the ranks of big tech companies which will permanently embrace part-time remote working following the pandemic. The UK continued to have the highest numbers of office workers carrying out their roles from home at the end of January, for an average of 3.1 days a week, Morgan Stanley found, compared with employees in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. However, more German workers had switched to remote working in January for an average of 2.5 days a week compared with about a month earlier, as the country extended its lockdown. Morgan Stanley found that employees’ appetite for future home working has faded somewhat since last year, after a year of working in their kitchens, living rooms and bedrooms. Half of office-based staff in the five European nations surveyed said they hoped to work from home for about two days a week in future. Coronavirus has permanently altered working habits for some of the world’s biggest tech firms, with Salesforce the latest to join the likes of Twitter and Facebook in embracing remote working after the pandemic. The San Francisco-based firm has announced that it will let the majority of its 54,000 global employees work from home in future for at least part of the week, including its 2,700 staff in the UK. Salesforce, which has UK offices in the City of London and Staines, Surrey, said it would reopen its offices in line with government guidance and advice of medical experts. It added that it would “continuously evaluate” its global real estate strategy “to best meet the needs across the business to further innovation, collaboration, and our commitment to our employees, customers, partners, and communities”. The delayed return to offices and increased remote working in future, combined with higher unemployment, will continue to keep demand for office space low during 2021 and put pressure on rental values, Morgan Stanley researchers said. They added that this would affect the leisure and retail businesses that depend on passing trade from office staff. US banks with UK offices, including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, were among the first City firms to bring staff back to their headquarters last summer, before the government again changed its advice to recommend home working. The Guardian understands that JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have not yet set a date for a return to work, but hope to open their offices for staff other than critical workers, as government restrictions are eased. Goldman Sachs employees who are working in the firm’s London headquarters for most of the working week have been required since mid-January to take two coronavirus tests a week. These tests are carried out in the existing medical centre inside the bank’s City building."
2021-02-10T13:33:08Z,business,Business,"Too soon to book holiday in UK or abroad, says Grant Shapps","The transport secretary has told people in Britain not to book holidays domestically or abroad, provoking an immediate backlash from the UK’s embattled travel industry. “People shouldn’t be booking holidays right now – not domestically or internationally,” Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. It was too soon, he added. However, the travel industry on Wednesday appeared to contradict Shapps, saying that some package holiday customers could rely on refunds if the Foreign Office banned non-essential travel to holiday destinations. A spokesperson for the Association of British Travel Agents said: “You can book a summer holiday now with confidence by booking a package holiday through an Abta member, and many travel companies are also offering additional flexibility to take into account the uncertainty created by the pandemic.” Domestic and international travel companies have pinned their hopes for recovery on a return to something like normal service over the summer as the coronavirus vaccination programme allows people within the UK to emerge from national lockdowns. Holidays are banned under lockdown rules in England.
Shapps said Boris Johnson would lay out on 22 February how the UK plans to lift lockdown restrictions but said it was not clear that holidays would be included in those plans because of uncertainty over the development of vaccinations and pressures on the health service. International holidaymakers face the added complication of potential quarantines on arrival from some countries, amid concerns about the possibility of vaccine-resistant variants of Covid-19. The government has said that arrivals in the UK who lie about their travel history will be liable for prison sentences of up to 10 years, although the plans have been criticised as being heavy-handed. Easing of restrictions on international holidays would be influenced by “not just the vaccination programme here but the vaccination programme internationally, because people will be going outside of our borders”, Shapps said. Abta said the industry could not afford to lose another summer by waiting for the rollout of vaccinations. The lobby group instead called for the government to consider vaccine certificates, often labelled “vaccine passports”, as well as testing. It also called for more financial support specifically for travel businesses.
Some travel companies have reported increased bookings from customers hoping to secure a deal, and, in many cases, leave the UK for the first time since March 2020 or earlier. Ryanair’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, said on Wednesday that he was “optimistic that people will be allowed to travel from May onwards”. Last week regulators banned an advertising campaign by Ryanair that said customers could “jab and go” this summer. The advertising regulator said it encouraged risk-taking. However, O’Leary said losing another summer could result in travel company bankruptcies. “Many companies will not see their way through next winter if we go through a second summer of no bookings,” he told the BBC. Johan Lundgren, easyJet’s chief executive, said on Wednesday that the UK government must set out its plans on easing restrictions on international travel. The airline said last month that between January and March it planned to fly only 10% of the flights it operated during the same period before the pandemic, a reduction from the 18% of capacity used in the last three months of 2020. “I’m positive for a strong summer if the vaccination programmes are successful, if it works on the variants … then we know that there’s a big urgent need for the government to unwind these restrictions,” Lundgren told an online aviation conference. On Tuesday, the Anglo-German tour operator Tui said it expected a return to international holiday travel this summer. Tui has put on 80% of its 2019 summer holiday programme for 2021, with Greece and Spain the most popular destinations. Those two countries are significantly behind the UK in terms of the proportion of people vaccinated."

2021-02-10T08:48:33Z,business,Business,Housebuilder Persimmon sets aside £75m for cladding removal,"The housebuilder Persimmon has set aside £75m to pay for any work needed to remove cladding on its high-rise buildings after a review of its past developments. The developer is mostly known for constructing family homes but has identified 26 multistorey buildings it constructed that have cladding that may need to be removed. The company’s financial commitment came before an expected government announcement about providing billions of pounds of extra support for the owners of flats in buildings covered with cladding. The Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017 exposed the dangerous defects in thousands of apartment blocks across the UK, many of which were covered in flammable cladding. The subsequent cladding crisis sparked disagreements over who is responsible for paying for its removal, with some homeowners facing huge bills for the work. Conservative MPs have said building firms and cladding manufacturers should be pursued for costs, yet there have been calls for government support as leaseholders have been left with flats that are unsellable, unmortgageable and uninsurable. Persimmon believes its buildings account for less than 1% of all UK high-rise developments. However, it confirmed that some of its multistorey buildings used cladding materials that may now be considered unsafe and may need to be removed, even though they met the fire safety rules and regulations that were in place at the time. Roger Devlin, the chairman of Persimmon, said the concerns around cladding were affecting thousands of homeowners in high-rise buildings. “At Persimmon, we believe we have a clear duty to act to address this issue,” Devlin said. “Where we still own the building we will act. Where we no longer own them we will work with the owners to make sure they meet their legal responsibilities and duty. If the owner does not step up, then we will act to remove uncertainty and anxiety for residents and make the buildings safe. “This is a decision which we believe is not only right for residents but also the right thing for us to do as one of the leading housebuilders in the UK.” The group has identified nine high-rise buildings it developed that are more than 18 metres tall, where cladding may need to be removed, in line with government guidance.
Persimmon no longer owns these buildings but said it would provide technical support to ensure the building was made safe, and will also help to complete the work if the building owner does not accept its responsibilities. In addition, the company has identified 17 buildings below 18 metres that may be fitted with cladding and which require detailed investigation. Persimmon said it would lead the work on the buildings which it still owns and would provide support for the owners in other cases. Persimmon said it was writing to building owners and management companies about its review of its developments and to agree the next steps, and that it intended to act swiftly."
2021-02-10T06:01:27Z,business,Business,British pub beer sales at lowest level since 1920s,"Beer sales in British pubs halved last year to the lowest since the 1920s as they faced some of the toughest and longest-lasting restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, according to industry figures. Overall beer sales in pubs were down 56% in 2020 to about £6.1bn, a loss of £7.8bn in sales compared with 2019, said the British Beer & Pub Association (BBPA) – the lowest volume of beer sold in at least a century. The evidence of a collapse in spending comes as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, faces mounting pressure to take action to prevent a wave of business failures in the hospitality sector that experts say would hold back Britain’s economic recovery after lockdown is relaxed. The Resolution Foundation said more than half of hospitality firms in Britain – including pubs, cafes and restaurants – have fewer than three months’ of cash reserves left due to the financial damage from multiple lockdowns and weaker demand during the pandemic.
Calling for an expansion in government grants for firms in the hardest-hit sectors at the 3 March budget, the thinktank warned that struggling hospitality firms were more likely to shed jobs and close venues over the coming months, undermining the recovery.
Pub beer sales were 77% lower in the last three months of 2020 compared with 2019, as pubs were closed under various tier systems and an English national lockdown in November. Sales in the second quarter of 2020, during the first lockdown, were down 96% year-on-year. The BBPA said a government stimulus package was needed, as well as a timeline for the reopening of pubs at the same time as non-essential retailers when the mass Covid-19 vaccination programme allows the latest lockdown to ease. The Resolution Foundation said across the UK economy total company cash holdings increased by £118bn in 2020, in stark contrast to average declines of about £40bn during each of the last four recessions. But it said firms in the hardest-hit sectors, such as hospitality, were experiencing major difficulties. It said this risked translating into widespread company failures and redundancies unless action is taken. Jack Leslie, an economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “While the path to recovery is now in sight, business still face huge problems ahead. Firms in social sectors like hospitality are running out of cash, and many are likely to shed staff or fold altogether unless further targeted support is provided.” Pubs across the UK have faced restrictions ranging from curfews and bans on household mixing, to requirements to only serve alcohol with “substantial meals”. During the national lockdowns all pubs have been closed, and they have been among the last venues to reopen when restrictions have been relaxed.
Nick Mackenzie, chief executive of Greene King, a pub chain and brewer, said that a return to “complex and unjustified restrictions” would make it unviable for pubs to reopen. He said the sector urgently needed clarification on more support. Great Britain lost almost 6,000 licensed venues during 2020, according to the industry analysts CGA and AlixPartners. The BBPA said thousands more debt-laden pubs would be forced to close unless Sunak extended financial support for the sector, including extending a VAT cut and a business rates holiday. The lobby group also asked for a cut in beer duty. Phil Whitehead, the BBPA’s chair, said the uncertainty over when pubs could reopen was “not sustainable for our sector” as it faced months with zero sales. A Treasury spokesperson said the government had invested more than £280bn during the pandemic to protect millions of jobs and businesses. “At the upcoming budget we’ll outline the next stages of our Plan for Jobs to support businesses and families across the UK. That has been our priority throughout the past year and it will be the priority for the year to come.”"
2021-02-10T06:00:27Z,business,Business,Pharmacists in England considering strike action over Covid debts,"Pharmacists in England are considering strike action unless the Treasury writes off a £370m debt from a support package awarded during the pandemic, which saw many chemists help deliver vaccines. The chair of the National Pharmacy Association urged the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to intervene in the budget on 3 March, saying the industry did not want to stage walkouts but many members were facing closure due to unsustainable debts. Andrew Lane, chairman of the National Pharmacy Association, told the Guardian: “This is a desperate situation for many of our members, so it’s not surprising that you do hear people talking about some form of protest. “But no one wants to let their patients down, so strike action is the last thing any pharmacist would want to do. Instead, we need to continue to make the evidence-based case and appeal to the government to do the right thing by the nation’s heroic pharmacists and the patients they serve.”
High street pharmacies have found themselves on the frontline of primary care during the pandemic as many GP surgeries switched to telephone consultations. Larger pharmacies are operating as coronavirus vaccination hubs, though they must commit to offering 1,000 jabs a week, which many smaller providers cannot meet. The industry, which is said to be close to the chancellor’s heart as his mother was a community pharmacist, was offered £370m in government loans last year to help meet additional costs amid the pandemic. It now wants that debt to be waived. An industry source told the Guardian that Steve Barclay, chief secretary to the Treasury, had ruled out writing off the whole debt in recent meetings with pharmacy leaders, though some extra cash has been offered. It “falls way short”, the source said. The Treasury is said to have suggested the funding gap is met by the NHS. “They are batting this back to the NHS, saying the onus is on them to fund any shortfall,” the source said. “The sector now feels like community pharmacies are in effect subsidising the NHS.” A September report commissioned by the National Pharmacy Association predicted that under current funding, 72% of community pharmacies will be in debt by 2024. Eight out of 10 pharmacies told a parliamentary group that the government loans had not been enough to meet the extra costs of the crisis. The all-party parliamentary group on pharmacies wrote to the government in December asking that the debt be written off against the additional costs of Covid-19. Lane said the sector had not received any bailout cash because pharmacies had to continue to operate throughout the pandemic. “While other sectors get bailouts for being closed, community pharmacies are in debt because we’ve stayed open to save lives,” he said. “People can live without pizzas but they can die without their pills and the healthcare we provide. With each hour we stay open to provide vital services, the more money leaks from our pockets and hastens the demise of this country’s long-cherished pharmacy network. When will ministers finally make good on their commitment to meet the additional costs associated with coronavirus?” Industry insiders said they had had to provide a huge number of additional services, including mass pre-orders of medications and increased medication deliveries and frontline care, while experiencing a drop in footfall and demand for their other products. Pharmacies have also incurred additional costs in making their operations Covid-secure, such as introducing PPE and social distancing measures because of the higher risk of coming into contact with infected customers.
Labour’s shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, has written to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, asking him to help unblock the funding. “Community pharmacies have played a key role in the national response to Covid and should be fully mobilised as part of the vaccination effort, especially with hard-to-reach communities,” Ashworth said. “Now many are facing financial ruin thanks to Rishi Sunak’s attempts to claw back this extra support. Ministers should be doing everything they can to support pharmacies through the Covid crisis.” In his letter this week, Ashworth said mounting costs had been “directly incurred in the battle against Covid-19 … The repayment of this loan threatens the future of thousands of pharmacies, coming on top of several years of reduced funding for the sector.” Ashworth said GPs have had £197.5m in costs reimbursed across 6,800 practices despite not being fully physically open, and NHS dentists have received permanent payments for lost income as a result of coronavirus. “They feel there is not a level playing field between different primary care providers, and that they are being penalised for their hard work and commitment,” he wrote. “They have pointed to considerable ‘buck-passing’ between NHS England, DHSC [Department of Health and Social Care] and the Treasury on where the decision lies to progress this or a similar solution.” Any move towards industrial action would be controversial, and one industry insider said they were doubtful all members would adhere. In 2009, pharmacists in Ireland held a crippling 10-day strike, which caused long queues for medications, over cuts in payments to pharmacists. It was eventually called off over patient safety concerns. The Treasury and Department for Health were approached for comment. • This article was amended on 15 February 2021. A previous version quoted a draft of Jonathan Ashworth’s letter to Matt Hancock that omitted the word “fully” from this passage: “GPs have had £197.5m in costs reimbursed across 6,800 practices despite not being fully physically open.”"
2021-02-09T23:00:18Z,business,Business,"Most Australian aviation workers fear losing their job when jobkeeper ends, survey finds","Almost three-quarters of aviation workers fear they will be unable to support their families when jobkeeper wage subsidies end in March, according to a new union survey. The survey of 560 aviation workers by the Australian Services Union (ASU) paints a dire picture of the threat of job cuts to those in the sector hardest hit by Covid-19, in which 88% of workers have been stood down and 30% are still not getting any hours. The aviation sector has already lost at least 11,000 jobs, with a further 2,500 ground-handling and cleaning jobs outsourced at Qantas.
While the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has boasted that 450,000 businesses and 2 million workers have “graduated” off the jobkeeper wage subsidy – the story is different in the aviation sector because international travel remains banned and domestic travel has been hugely disrupted by periodic border closures. With 80,000 people working in the sector and 78% of those surveyed still receiving jobkeeper, the ASU report points to tens of thousands of jobs at risk when wage subsidies expire at the end of March. Jayne Hrdlicka, the chief executive of Virgin Australia, which has 6,600 employees on jobkeeper after cutting 3,000 jobs, has warned of further cuts if jobkeeper isn’t replaced. The ASU survey found that 82% of aviation workers did not feel their job was secure and 72% were worried about being unable to financially support their family without the jobkeeper payment. Jobkeeper was reduced from $1,500 a fortnight to $1,200 in December and again to $1,000 in the new year. In December, when the survey was taken, 85% of workers said the payment was not enough to live on. The ASU assistant national secretary, Emeline Gaske, said many workers (44%) had accessed their superannuation or depleted savings, meaning they would have “nothing left to fall back on” when jobkeeper ended in March. “I think it’s an absolute catastrophe waiting to happen,” she told Guardian Australia. “People are going to lose their jobs in huge numbers, have no income or be stood down and stood up haphazardly, with a little income one week, and none the next. They won’t be able to put food on the table, pay their mortgage or rent.”
Peter Evans, a full-time load controller at an aviation business based at Melbourne airport, told Guardian Australia that with the number of flights down to 10% of the normal load, he had shifts cut in half to four hours a couple of times a week. “We’re only paid the amount of jobkeeper – the company can only give shifts for the few flights that are there – so heading in to the end of March is a pretty anxious time.” Cuts to jobkeeper “certainly did” have a financial impact, Evans said, preventing he and his wife saving superannuation and for holidays – while “a lot of friends at work are behind on everything”. Evans believes he’s better off because his wife works full-time and the company is likely to try to retain its load controllers, but it “wouldn’t and couldn’t afford to” guarantee work for all disciplines. “There’s going to be shortages of work and cuts to shifts – some people have only been working once a week since the pandemic started.” The union said aviation was the first sector impacted by Covid-19 and would be the last to recover, because it had been affected by government policies restricting travel. “They were good policies but that means the sector is worthy of support,” Gaske said. She said the industry “can’t afford to lose” highly experienced workers with “decades of training, qualifications and experience who keep us safe when we fly”. “This is a group of people that we need to keep connected to their employers now, if we want to have a viable industry [when it reopens after vaccination rollout].” In January the ASU and the Transport Workers Union wrote to the Morrison government calling for an extension of jobkeeper in the sector. The coalition is considering a further bailout for the tourism sector, after lobbying from its own MPs that the sector cannot be left to fail. On Sunday the transport minister, Michael McCormack, suggested the aviation sector would likely be included in a support package, telling Sky News that “planes in the air means jobs on the ground”. “We want to make sure that as many of those people who work in the aviation sector have a job and a career going forward,” he said. “And so that is what we will continue to do.” McCormack pointed to $2.7bn of assistance already provided to the sector and confirmed he had discussed continuing support with Qantas, Virgin and regional operators. “We’ll continue to have those conversations and we’ll continue to provide the right assistance as you would expect a good and responsible government to do.”"

The Ocado co-founder also owns a stake in the company worth close to £600m. The group’s chief operating officer, Mark Richardson; Luke Jensen, who runs its tech business, Ocado Solutions; and Neil Abrams, the company secretary, will also each receive 600,000 shares, worth £16.2m under the so-called “value creation plan”. It is a five-year scheme and shares awarded to executives cannot be sold until 2022 at the earliest. The report, which revealed Steiner earned £7m last year, was published on the same day as annual results which showed the group made a small loss of £44m in the year to 29 November. That compares with a pre-tax loss of £214.5m in 2019. As part of its plan to “retain the right calibre of senior executives” the board of the FTSE 100 company has also upped Steiner’s salary from £720,000 to £738,000 for this year. His 2020 pay packet was a big step down from last year when he earned close to £60m after a previous bonus scheme windfall. Minerva, a shareholder adviser, said the scheme could transfer significant equity value to the chief executive and considering Steiner was already a significant shareholder it was hard to accept it was there to “attract, recruit and retain”. Successive UK lockdowns and the switch to working from home has seen the online grocery market double in size to 14% of the UK total since the start of the pandemic. Retail sales at Ocado, which delivers Marks & Spencer groceries, jumped 35% to £2.2bn. Investors are closely watching the progress being made by Ocado Solutions, which sells its grocery-picking expertise to foreign supermarkets and has been likened to the “Microsoft of retail”. The promise being shown by both sides of the business has propelled the share price from around £12 a year ago, to £27.
The pay gap between the Ocado chief executive and the company’s median employee is already the widest of any company in the FTSE 100, said Luke Hildyard of the High Pay Centre, who suggested the disparity might anger some shoppers. Hildyard added: “The size of these payouts will prompt debate about governance reforms such as profit sharing schemes or worker representation on boards that would enable some of the company’s 17,000 delivery drivers, warehouse operatives and administrative staff to win a share of the tens of millions lavished on directors.” Steiner expects the online grocery market to continue growing even after the pandemic is over and shot down the notion of an online sales tax which is being mooted as part of the reform of business rates. “We already have sales tax in the UK, it is called VAT,” said Steiner, who said there was no outcry when retailers moved from operating in high street locations to cheaper out of town retail parks and malls. “I don’t think it is appropriate to put a sales tax on a retailer because they operate from a different type of premises or are a more efficient operator,” he said. “The growth in online is being driven by the consumer. It is what the consumer wants.”"
2021-02-09T19:43:21Z,business,Business,Ocado may lose out despite its lockdown-aided sales rise,"Ocado is a company that delivers groceries to people’s homes. Off and on for the last year the public have been subject to a form of house arrest. So you don’t need to have studied Adam Smith or John Maynard Keynes to work out why the business is doing well. Covid-19 has taken a trend that has been evident for the past decade or so and accelerated it. The backdrop to Ocado’s 35% sales increase is the massive increase in market penetration of online retailers during the Covid pandemic. The British Retail Consortium has said online shopping accounted for 63% of non-food sales in January, more than double the 31% a year earlier. Ocado is, of course, an online supermarket but even so a 35% jump in revenues is not to be sniffed at. It would have been still higher had the company not run into capacity constraints, a problem now being addressed. What may surprise some Ocado customers is that even in the most benign conditions imaginable the company is still making a loss. That, though, has more to do with investment in the part of the business that involves selling the company’s tech abroad. Investors in Ocado have been a bit like those in Amazon: they have had to learn to be patient and wait for the profits to roll in. There is another sense, too, in which Ocado is like Amazon: neither retailer is at all keen on the idea of a digital sales tax. Tim Steiner, Ocado’s chief executive, said the company’s growth was due to consumer choice and it was not appropriate to penalise a business simply because it operated from different premises or because they were more efficient. In the short term, Steiner has nothing to fear. Rishi Sunak is not about to clobber Ocado and other digital retailers with a pandemic windfall tax in his March budget. Longer term, though, it is likely to be a different story. The Treasury cannot simply write off Britain’s high streets, putting their demise down to creative destruction in action. Pressure to help bricks-and-mortar retailers is sure to intensify. And, whether through a digital sales tax, higher business rates, or some other method, companies such as Ocado will rightly end up paying more.
Andrew Bailey has a memory problem Dame Elizabeth Gloster is a former high court judge who, like all members of the judiciary, chooses her words carefully. So when she says she disagrees with the testimony the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, gave this week to a Treasury committee hearing into the collapse of London Capital & Finance, alarm bells started to clang at the Bank. The issue is not whether the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) – which Bailey ran at the time – made a total mess of LC&F because there is no dispute that it did. Rather, it is whether Bailey sought to have his name taken out of Gloster’s report on the scandal. Gloster said he did; Bailey told MPs he didn’t and there had been a fundamental misunderstanding about what he was trying to do. Gloster has now written to the committee saying she “disagreed” with Bailey that he was merely asking for a distinction to be drawn between personal culpability and responsibility. To rub it in, she said there had been no fundamental misunderstanding. Gloster is not accusing Bailey of lying, but she is saying that his testimony to the committee was – in her view – not entirely accurate. The governor, who would dearly like to get on with doing his day job, is sticking to what he told MPs. The danger, though, is that he will be seen as the man who should have done more to stop small investors getting fleeced and then tried to avoid being personally embarrassed over the FCA’s failings. The Treasury committee will have to decide what and who it believes. Its report, not due out until May, has the potential to cause Bailey serious grief."
2021-02-09T19:28:59Z,business,Business,KPMG UK chair tells staff to 'stop moaning' about Covid work conditions,"The UK chair of accountancy firm KPMG has apologised to staff after telling them to “stop moaning” during a virtual meeting about the pandemic and the impact of lockdown on people’s lives. Bill Michael, an Australian who has headed the company since 2017, was speaking at a town hall meeting on Monday with members of the firm’s financial services consulting team when he made the comments. Around a third of the team’s 1,500 employees took part in the virtual meeting which covered a wide range of topics including life in lockdown, where workers also raised concerns about their potential future pay cuts and changes to their remuneration. Michael told staff from the “Big Four” accountancy firm to “stop moaning” and that they should stop “playing the victim card”, according to the Financial Times. It is understood that employees taking part in the meeting referred to and criticised Michael’s remarks in the comments section of the app used to conduct the event. Michael, who was hospitalised with Covid-19 in March 2020, subsequently rejoined the call and apologised to staff for his choice of words. He explained that he had not intended for his comments to come across as they did, and that he had meant to share with colleagues how he looks after himself during lockdown, by taking walks and ensuring he does not schedule meetings late in the evening. Michael later apologised by email to all members of the financial services consulting team at the accounting giant. Michael said in a statement: “I am sorry for the words I used, which did not reflect what I believe in, and I have apologised to my colleagues. Looking after the wellbeing of our people and creating a culture where everyone can thrive is of critical importance to me and is at the heart of everything we do as a firm.” The apology comes just days after KPMG revealed in its annual results that its partners had received 11% less pay in 2020 than the previous year, resulting in average pay of £572,000 each for its 582 partners. Michael received £1.7m, which was 14% lower than the near-£2m he collected in 2019. The pay cuts at the Big Four firm, which employs 16,000 people across the UK, came as it reported a 6% drop in annual underlying profits, as a result of weaker demand for consulting and advisory services at the start of the pandemic. KPMG said the pay cuts were needed to “protect jobs and support employees”, including the continued hiring of graduates and trainees."
2021-02-09T19:17:19Z,business,Business,Bank of England chief's evidence to MPs questioned by former senior judge ,"A former high court judge has publicly questioned the evidence the governor of the Bank of England has given to MPs over the London Capital & Finance (LC&F) collapse, as a row about a report into the scandal escalated. Dame Elizabeth Gloster, who headed an inquiry into LC&F, said she “must disagree” with some of the evidence that Andrew Bailey presented on Monday, and that she also rejected his suggestion there had been a “fundamental misunderstanding”.
The dispute concerns Gloster’s official 494-page report into the £236m LC&F investment scandal, which contained a damning verdict on the Financial Conduct Authority’s failure to properly supervise and regulate the firm, which collapsed in 2019. Bailey was chief executive of the FCA from July 2016 until March 2020, when he took over as the Bank of England governor. The report, published just before Christmas, disclosed that Bailey had asked investigators “to delete references to ‘responsibility’ resting with specific identified/identifiable individuals” for the FCA’s failures. However, Gloster stuck to her ground and included his name and those of two other individuals. Giving evidence to MPs on the Treasury select committee on 1 February, Gloster said there had been “quite a lot of pushback” to her decision to name Bailey and the other two people, and that it seemed “inappropriate, in quite a serious way” and “a lack of judgment” to try to suggest that their names should not be mentioned. Giving evidence before the same committee on Monday, Bailey did not attempt to disguise his anger about the issue. Asked by MPs if he regretted making representations about being named, he said there had been a “fundamental misunderstanding” on this, adding: “It is not correct to present the points I made in my representations as in any sense an unconditional statement that I didn’t want my name mentioned.” He said that as the former chief executive, he took responsibility for the FCA, but the draft version of Gloster’s report contained “ambiguity” in terms of the distinction between this more general responsibility and “personal culpability” (blame). Bailey added: “The point I was making was not about responsibility … I’m probably sounding quite angry now, and I am.” But Gloster has now hit back at these comments. In a letter to the committee of MPs that was released to the media, she said Bailey’s “primary position” in the representations he had made was that references to him or anyone else having personal responsibility for the FCA’s regulation of LC&F should be deleted. She said: “The distinction between personal culpability and responsibility was merely one argument in support of that position.” Gloster added that, when it came to Bailey’s argument that his representations were limited to merely requesting a distinction between personal culpability and responsibility, “I must disagree”. She added: “I also reject his suggestion that there has been a ‘fundamental misunderstanding’ on this issue.”
In her letter, Gloster included extracts from Bailey’s representations at the time. More than 11,600 people had invested a total of £237m when LC&F collapsed in January 2019. Its “mini-bonds” had promised returns to investors of up to 8% a year. In a statement responding to Gloster’s latest comments, the Bank of England continued to talk about a lack of clarity. “As the governor made clear in parliament yesterday [Monday], his legal representations were made in the context of a draft report which was not clear on the distinction between personal culpability or blame, and responsibility. If that had been made clear in the draft report, the governor would not have needed to make the representations. At no point was his intention to imply he did not take full responsibility. As the governor said yesterday and to Dame Elizabeth, he fully accepts responsibility for everything that occurred during his time at the FCA and welcomed the opportunity yesterday to reiterate that, and his apology to bondholders,” said a Bank spokesman. He added: “As the governor said yesterday, Dame Elizabeth and he disagree on points of process and some of her conclusions, but he fully respects her independence and does not propose to comment further.”"
2021-02-09T18:16:19Z,business,Business,Former Arcadia staff pursue compensation over redundancies,"Hundreds of former Arcadia staff are lining up to claim compensation after being made redundant following the collapse of Sir Philip Green’s fashion empire. Two no-win no-fee legal firms say they have already gathered almost 200 potential claimants who they say may not have been properly consulted before losing their jobs. Aticus Law has at least 150 potential claimants lined up while Simpson Millar has already signed up 10 claimants from across the Arcadia Group, and had enquiries from dozens more. Usdaw, the shopworkers union, said it was consulting with members and would consider seeking compensation for those affected. The union is already backing a similar claim for former Debenhams workers. Up to 12,000 people are set to lose their jobs at Arcadia after its main brands, Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge, Wallis, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, were sold off to online specialists Asos and Boohoo who have not taken on the group’s hundreds of stores. There is a legal duty to consult collectively with staff in shops or other locations where more than 20 redundancies are made. Workers who were not properly consulted are entitled to a “protective award” of up to 90 days’ wages, capped at £4,353 each, if an employment tribunal finds that a company has not conducted a proper consultation process with them ahead of their dismissal. Damian Kelly, head of employment law at Simpson Millar, said: “While some companies are struggling because of the pandemic, they still have a duty under current employment law legislation to carry out a proper consultation with staff at risk of redundancies. Where that does not happen, employees can bring a claim for a protective award.”
Deloitte, which is handling the administration of Arcadia, said: “It would be inappropriate for us to comment on the employee consultation process. However, we absolutely recognise it is a very difficult time for all those impacted by the administration of the group.” Lawyers have previously won protective claims for workers at BHS, which collapsed in 2016, and electrical goods chain Comet, which collapsed in 2012 as well as numerous other collapsed firms. The complex claims, which begin with an application to conciliation before Acas before usually going to tribunal, can take up to two years to reach conclusion. The claims against collapsed businesses are usually met by the government-backed Redundancy Payments Service, part of the Insolvency Service, rather than the companies themselves."
2021-02-09T16:20:09Z,business,Business,German sandal maker Birkenstock in €4bn takeover battle,"German sandal maker Birkenstock is at the centre of a €4bn (£3.5bn) takeover battle as the trend for casual footwear steps up during the pandemic. Private equity firm CVC Capital Partners, the owner of dozens of companies from motorway services firm Moto to luxury watchmaker Breitling, is vying to buy a majority stake in Birkenstock with L Catterton, a private equity firm part-owned by Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior owner LVMH. L Catterton already owns fashion brands including Ganni, Seafolly and Pepe Jeans. Founded in 1774 in Langen-Bergheim by cobbler Johann Adam Birkenstock, the company set up its first factory in 1925. It is still owned by descendants of its founder – brothers Alex and Christian Birkenstock – and continues to make all its footwear in Germany.
The Birkenstock brothers began to look for new investment late last year as they try to drive expansion in newer markets including China and India. L Catterton is understood to be the favoured bidder, because of its expertise in taking brands to Asia and knowledge of the fashion market, but the company has yet to finalise its offer. Interest in brands that mix comfort and heritage has soared during the pandemic, helping bootmaker Dr Martens’ launch on the London stock market with a valuation of £3.7bn last month. The firm already has a market valuation of more than £5bn. Birkenstock sales surged 11% to €721.5m in 2019, when nearly 24m pairs of sandals were sold worldwide. Even more of the blocky footwear is thought to have sold in 2020 as Birkenstock’s comfy sandals and clogs became a lockdown hit in many countries, including the UK. Nicla di Palma, an analyst at Brewin Dolphin, said brands such as Dr Martens and Birkenstock were riding on the back of a trend towards comfort and durability over style, both at work and at home. “This was happening well before covid but the pandemic has accelerated the trend as has happened with many other [trends],” she said. Lorna Hall, director of fashion intelligence at consumer trends forecaster WGSN, said interest in Dr Martens and Birkenstock was high because there were few brands with the same genuine heritage. “They have authentic heritage at a mid price and are associated with the drivers of fashionability at the moment – comfort and health,” Hall said, adding that Birkenstock was also linked to sustainability, which is fast becoming an important factor for consumers.
Comfortable footwear is hot property because of an increasing acceptance of casual dressing in society, while younger shoppers’ are no longer wedded to high heels and delicate footwear. “Traditional ideas of femininity have completely changed. Those archetypes still exist but for a certain job or going on a particular night out,” Hall said. Hall added that Birkenstock and Dr Martens regularly reinvented themselves for new audiences by mimicking the luxury brands’ tactic of collaborating with designers or other brands to bring in fresh ideas. Birkenstock, in particular, has brought in new shoe shapes on a regular basis to create trends within its own brand. “They have not sat on their laurels and that has driven volumes,” Hall said."

2021-02-09T14:47:07Z,business,Business,Autonomy co-founder's lawyers attack 'overweening' US extradition effort,"Lawyers acting for Mike Lynch, the British tech multimillionaire facing extradition on fraud charges, accused the US in a London court on Monday of exerting itself as “an overweening international police force”. Lynch, charged with 14 counts of conspiracy and fraud linked to the $11.6bn (£8.6bn) sale of his former company Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard (HP) a decade ago, was beginning a legal fight against extradition to the US at Westminster magistrates court. Lawyers for Lynch told the court the executive, who denies the charges, should face trial in the UK. Alex Bailin QC, representing Lynch, said the US Department of Justice is “not the global marshal of the corporate world” and that as the alleged crimes took place in the UK he should face the allegations here. “We say this case belongs here in Britain. It concerns events, the overwhelming majority of which occurred in the United Kingdom,” Bailin told the court. The US is seeking to extradite Lynch to stand trial in the US because it alleges that he fraudulently inflated the value of Autonomy before its sale to HP in 2011. HP wrote down the value of Autonomy by $8.8bn just one year after the sale, after allegedly discovering $5bn of “accounting improprieties, disclosure failures and outright misrepresentations”. HP is also suing Lynch for $5bn in a civil case in which judgment is expected in the the next few months. Bailin said: “A decision in this court [against extradition] would not be an automatic ‘get out of jail free’ card. The SFO [Serious Fraud Office] might decide to prosecute him. And, of course, he would vigorously contest that trial on British soil.” Bailin alleged that the US planned to call upon Sushovan Hussain, Autonomy’s former chief financial officer, to give evidence against his former boss. Hussain, also a British citizen, was in 2019 convicted in the US on 16 counts of fraud and sentenced to five years in jail and handed a $4m fine. “There was a desire to convict Mr Hussain first and try to get him to cooperate and get him to testify against Mr Lynch,” Bailin said “‘Flipping the witness’ as it’s called in the vernacular, I believe.” A lawyer for the US government told the court Lynch was “the leader of a corporate conspiracy” based on “cooked books”. Marks Summers QC said: “This case is straightforward … This was an English company, cooking its books in England, making it appear what it wasn’t, and then persuading an American company to grossly overpay for it, based on those cooked books. “The only unusual feature of this case was the titanic scale of the money involved.” He suggested that even “the most basic school child maths” suggested HP had been tricked into paying at least $1.7bn too much. Lynch personally made about $800m from the sale of Autonomy, which he founded in Cambridge in 1996, and had retained a large stake. The case is being closely followed politically, as several ministers have raised concerns about Lynch’s extradition and also long-running suggestions that the UK-US extradition treaty is lopsided in favour of the US.
Boris Johnson called the treaty “imbalanced” when speaking about the US decision to refuse an extradition request for Anne Sacoolas, the suspect charged with causing the death by reckless driving of Harry Dunn. Five former British cabinet ministers last month signed a letter to the Times arguing that Lynch must not be extradited. “The government cannot stand by as another Briton risks being delivered like this to the US justice system,” the letter said. In 2013, judges were granted new powers known as the “forum bar”, which can be used to block extraditions if a large part of the alleged criminal activity took place in the UK. The judge, Michael Snow, said he would wait for the outcome of the civil trial before making a ruling on the extradition case. The hearing continues."
2021-02-09T12:45:48Z,business,Business,Summer holidays: what financial risks do UK travellers face?,"News that an increasing number of Tui customers have been booking summer holidays may be something of a surprise, given that ministers have repeatedly warned that travel abroad this summer is very much in the balance. Yesterday Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said it was too early to say whether the public should be making holiday bookings. “I can’t give people a proper answer at this point because we don’t yet have the data,” he said. If you are desperate to get a trip in the diary, what do you need to consider?
Package or self-book holiday? Over the past decade package holidays have been falling out of favour as travellers opted to book their own flights and accommodation separately using the likes of Airbnb or Booking.com. This year, however, a package holiday could be the way to go – for one simple reason. If the tour operator is forced to cancel because travel restrictions are still in place, travellers are entitled to a full refund via the package tour regulations. If the company goes bust before you head off to the airport, you are similarly protected. Book your own trip, and it’s a very different story. While plenty of hotel reservations are 100% refundable, Airbnb bookings are subject to cancellation charges that can be as high as 50%. If the airline’s flight runs but you can’t be on it, you will face a struggle to get your money back. Those with European train bookings in 2020 struggled to get refunds. Ferry passengers were mostly offered vouchers. The cost of all the tests could be more than the holiday This is one of the biggest risks of booking a trip now. Currently those heading to Europe on business are required to have a PCR test 72 hours before departure which costs £100-£180. They also have to take a fast, 30-minute Covid-19 test which costs a further £50-£75 at the airport – before they have left the country. If they face the same on the way back, the trip becomes massively expensive. And, on Tuesday, the government said it would expect travellers returning to the UK to have two further tests once they return home. If passengers were forced to pay for those as well, it could easily double of the cost of the holiday. Vaccine passports The thing that could save this summer – a passport that would enable passengers to show they had had the jab. Several European countries have indicated these could be the way forward. However, the UK government has, so far, been very cool on their implementation on the basis that they would discriminate against those unable or unwilling to be vaccinated. However, faced with the bill to keep the travel industry going in the event that travel bans have to stay in place for a further year, ministers might overcome their objection. The travel industry is unlikely to survive another year like 2020. If I don’t book now, will there be any holidays left? A good question: possibly not. Many of those who had trips cancelled last year were shunted on a year, meaning that a lot of capacity is already taken up. There’s a lot of pent-up demand to get abroad, and if travel does go ahead, it is unlikely that everyone will get their first choice of holiday, and prices may be significantly higher. Those who booked in January could be sitting on a bargain, but don’t bet on it."
2021-02-09T10:00:09Z,business,Business,‘I thought buying things would make me feel better. It didn’t’: The rise of emotional spending,"In the past fortnight, I have bought the following items online: a hideous cat tree that takes up most of my living room, a lavender pillow spray, two scarves, a pair of gloves, two candles, a sheet mask, a pair of fleece-lined jogging bottoms (so comfy!), a card-holder and an under-eye brightening cream. None of these purchases were essential. Many I haven’t even taken out of the packaging, leaving them in a pile by the front door. Ten months into the pandemic, I know the rhythms of the courier networks better than I know my menstrual cycle. Royal Mail in the morning; DPD and Hermes in the afternoon. Amazon comes any time, including late at night. DPD couriers insist on taking a photo of you with the package, mortifyingly. I wonder where these photos go: me in a food-stained tracksuit, dirty-haired, holding an armful of packages I can’t remember ordering with an abashed smile. I pray they never see the light of day. When Covid hit, I decided: no more frivolous purchases. Journalism is a precarious industry at the best of times. But the pandemic just wouldn’t stop. March dragged into June then into January. My days were flabby and formless. I was bored. So I started buying things online, for the small thrill of hitting “check out” and having them arrive a few days later, a treat to break up the monotony of yet another day. I am not alone. The pandemic has prompted a frenzy of online spending. Mintel’s January 2021 consumer behaviour tracker shows that 53% of adults are shopping more online now than at the start of the pandemic. Data from Barclaycard, published in July, found that Britons spent £40.6bn online on non-essential items during lockdown – about £770 a person. Takeaway food and drink were the most popular purchases, followed by clothes and plants. Courier networks and Royal Mail have struggled to cope, citing exceptional demand for their services. The volume of parcels being sent means there is a cardboard shortage. Asos, whose profits fell 68% in 2019, added 3 million customers last year and increased profits by 329%. The company’s chief executive said this was partly due to fewer customers returning parcels than usual – possibly because they were unwilling to go to the post office during the pandemic.
The pandemic has been financially devastating for many people, particularly for the 3 million people excluded from government support. But, for some, the last 11 months have proved unexpectedly lucrative. Research from the Bank of England, published in August, found that 65% of households had not experienced a change to their income from pre-pandemic levels. “People have had such different lockdown experiences,” says Laura Whateley, the author of Money: A User’s Guide. “A huge number of people have lost their jobs and are struggling. But many other people have kept their jobs and aren’t going out, or commuting, so they’re feeling much more flush than normal and are spending their money online.” Most of this shopping is due to boredom. “I have all this time,” says Jonathan O’Neill, 44, a furloughed retail worker from western Cornwall. For want of something to do, O’Neill has become what he terms an “investigative shopper”: he fills his days hunting for bargains online. “I never used to be like this,” he says. O’Neill groans when I ask him about his purchases. “It’s all the cliched man things,” he says. “In the first lockdown, I bought a road bike – classic! I didn’t need a bike. I already had three. But it was on offer.” He has also recently bought a new TV – there was nothing wrong with the old one – and a £95 Carhartt sweatshirt, also on offer. O’Neill lives at the end of a small lane and delivery drivers often get lost dropping off parcels, meaning his neighbour collects them for him. “My neighbour leans out of the house and goes: ‘What’s in today’s box?’” he says. This type of shopping, says Emilie Bellet, the founder of the women’s investment community Vestpod, is called emotional spending. “It is guided by how you feel in a certain moment,” says Bellet. “When you buy something, you get a little rush of dopamine. It gives us a sense of control or a happy feeling.” She is not surprised that people are spending more on discretionary purchases during the pandemic. “It’s a distraction,” she says. “There’s a little package, containing a book or item of clothing, and perhaps it’s the only thing that happens during your day.”
Emotional spending can also be triggered by work pressures. “When I’m stressed or I’ve got loads of deadlines at work, buying things online is a nice release,” says Emrana Khatun, a 26-year-old PR executive from London. Khatun’s purchases fall into three categories: cute outfits to wear when the world reopens (she recently bought seven dresses in the Reformation sale); items for a fitness kick she plans to embark on (a NutriBullet, cycling equipment); and things to make her home nicer (house plants, an LED alarm clock). “Most of the stuff is piled up on a chair in my bedroom,” she says. “I haven’t even tried the clothes on.” Khatun has struggled with her mood during the most recent lockdown. This is driving her spending. “There’s hardly any sunlight,” she says. “I wake up and it’s dark, and I sit at my desk all day, and it’s so cold you don’t want to go outside. It’s pretty miserable.” Buying something online “creates a small moment of joy, but it never lasts long”. Because after the high of a frivolous purchase comes the guilt. “You realise there’s nothing you really needed,” she says. “You just got sucked into the moment and the high.” For parents trying to juggle work with the pressures of homeschooling young children, emotional spending can also be a way to mitigate guilt. “If it wasn’t for Covid, we’d be going out with the kids,” says Alex Wiseman, 40, an insurance worker from Ipswich. “But we can’t do that any more.” Wiseman keeps buying toys and clothes for his children, in addition to about 60 books for himself – which he has no time to read, given the demands of work and homeschooling. “You end up buying these bits for them because they’re plonked in front of the TV more than they would be usually,” he says. Because O’Neill is working from home, he is not “buying lunch out, or commuting, or paying for car parking”. But this can be a dangerous justification for future spending. “You tell yourself that you’re not in debt or anything like that, so it’s not out of control,” says Wiseman. Virtually all emotional spending is fuelled by social media. “I bought a paint-by-numbers kit,” laughs Sarah Kane, a 26-year-old HR worker from Surrey. “I can’t even paint! I don’t have the attention span for it. But I looked on Instagram and saw that everyone else was buying it and I did the same thing.” During the first lockdown, Kane’s emotional purchases spiralled out of control. “My flatmate joked that there was a parcel every day,” says Kane. “We lived on the third floor, so you’d have to spring downstairs every time the doorbell rang.”
Much emotional spending is fuelled by quick and easy-to-access credit. Kane has personal debt – she prefers not to say how much. “I never had financial education in school and would go into overdrafts and use credit cards without thinking anything of it,” she says. Before Covid hit, Kane had read Alex Holder’s Open Up: The Power of Talking About Money and decided to get on top of her debt, repaying a good chunk of the money she owed. “I was so happy,” she says. But her emotional spending during the first lockdown, along with dinners and drinks during the summer, pushed Kane back into the red. “I finished 2020 with the debts I started with,” she sighs. Most emotional shoppers do not think about their purchases in a meaningful way. “It’s so easy,” says Kane. “It’s one click. You see it on Instagram, click on it and express checkout with PayPal.” Amazon and eBay offer one-click purchasing, while seamless PayPal integration into most online shopping sites means you never even have to get your card out. Add to that buy-now-pay-later schemes such as Klarna and Clearpay and purchases don’t even show up on your bank balance or credit card statements. This is exactly how brands want you to spend: quickly and impulsively. “Everything about e-commerce is designed to remove friction,” says Clare Seal, the founder of the personal finance platform My Frugal Year. “Reducing load times and the number of clicks to purchase, encouraging people to save their card details – it is all removing the amount of time a shopper has to make an informed decision.” Half the time, consumers can’t even remember what they have purchased. “Every day a new parcel arrives and I don’t know what I’ve ordered,” says Khatun. I have experienced this fugue-like state, usually when I am brushing my teeth, perched on the side of my bath, clicking “add to cart” in the final moments before I go to bed. It turns out that companies know when I am weak – and this is when they target me. “Companies will know what kind of content you engage with at different times during the day,” says PK Kannan, a marketing expert at the University of Maryland. Marketers even analyse the circadian rhythms of their users and schedule their content at times when they are particularly receptive to buying things online. Banner ads that follow consumers across devices trap us in a “sales funnel”. “It’s scary when you look for something online and it pops up everywhere,” says Wiseman. “It’s relentless.” The only way to exit the funnel is by purchasing the item. “These are highly specialised techniques that use behaviour retargeting on consumers,” says Kannan. “You’ve shown interest, so I will follow you wherever you go with this same ad.” Khatun is being stalked by a Chloé handbag. “It follows me everywhere,” she says. “It’s very tempting. I tell myself I will be good, but I probably will cave.” The reason we are buying so many items online is simple: we are online more than ever. “It’s like sitting in a pub all day when you’re trying not to drink,” says Whateley. “People are tempted to buy more because we’re online all day long and social media is full of things to buy.” In April, Britons spent an average of four hours and two minutes online – up from three and a half hours in September 2019. It is a straightforward equation: more time online means more time to shop. (This is surely one reason for Google’s heavy investment in driverless cars – you can’t buy things when you are driving.) There are ways to resist the machiavellian machinations of our social media overlords. Kannan advises clearing the cookies on your computer and using the search engine DuckDuckGo, which protects your privacy. Unsubscribe from email marketing letters and unfollow accounts that tempt you to spend mindlessly. Reintroduce the friction into online shopping by deleting your card details from your favourite sites. “After I took my credit card off Amazon, my purchases went way down,” says Kane. Whateley says some banks will block card transactions to merchants if you ask them to. “Start spending in a way that feels purposeful,” says Bellet. “When you adopt an intentional approach to spending, you become more aware of your needs versus your wants.” Make a budget, determine the amount of money you will allocate to discretionary spending – and stick to it. “Spend it on whatever makes you happy,” says Bellet. Practise delayed gratification when purchasing items online. “Sleep on all purchases for at least a day, but ideally a week,” she says. Kane keeps a list on her phone of all the things she would like to buy. If she stays within her spending budget this month, she may buy one item – but it will be a conscious purchase, not an impulsive one. “I thought buying all these things would make me feel better, but they didn’t. What makes me feel better is going for a walk, or doing pilates, or having a bath … I feel 100% happier now,” she says of her new approach to spending. “There’s no guilty feeling any more.”"
2021-02-09T08:37:10Z,business,Business,Tui says it expects Covid vaccine will restart summer travel,"Tui said it expected a return to foreign holidays this summer, thanks to the UK’s vaccination programme and rapid tests in other countries. The world’s biggest travel operator said it had received 2.8m bookings for summer breaks, just more than half of 2019 levels, as customers splashed out on more expensive holidays. The German-based company is offering 80% of holidays compared with 2019 and said more than half of bookings were made by UK-based customers, partly because the British booking season starts earlier. Greece and Spain were the most popular destinations, with breaks in Morocco also sought after; bookings for Turkey have been slower. About half the bookings were made with vouchers issued after holiday cancellations due to Covid-19 last year.
Average holiday prices were up 20%, Tui said, as holidaymakers are spending more and booking five-star packages in greater numbers. Its daily bookings in January were 70% higher compared with December, and the company expects the peak booking period is still to come. The Tui chief executive, Fritz Joussen, said there was a lot of pent-up demand. “People are sitting on their suitcases and are waiting for what opens first. We just fly wherever is open.” He added: “A look at the historically high savings rate in the EU also underlines that the scope for consumer spending is high. The significant increase in spending on booked travel reflects this very clearly. Holidaymakers are catching up and are willing to pay more for their holidays. People are trading up and booking longer and more luxurious holidays.” He expressed hope that the UK would lead a recovery in travel thanks to its rapid vaccine rollout, and that other European countries would accelerate their programmes after a slower start. Tui expects three-quarters of the UK population to be vaccinated by mid-July, with the government aiming to give all over-50s a first jab by May. Joussen said: “The English market has a special significance for our company. We see an impressive pace and ambitious targets for vaccinations there. Vaccinations and rapid tests make an end to the standstill in tourism possible. I am hopeful that after a slow start, more energy is now being put on vaccination and the availability of rapid tests in other countries.”
Tui’s revenues were €486m (£426m) in the three months to December, down from €3.85bn a year earlier, as coronavirus lockdowns and travel restrictions took their toll. The Canary Islands were one of few holiday destinations that were open. The company agreed a third financing package with shareholders, banks and Germany’s economic stabilisation fund to get it through the pandemic. The €2.8bn package, including a €500m rights issue, was completed in late January. Tui’s share price closed down 4% at 318p on Tuesday. Julie Palmer, a partner at the restructuring firm Begbies Traynor, said: “Tui has been forced to cancel its holidays until March and Joussen will be waiting with bated breath for government announcements on the easing of Covid-19 restrictions in the near future. As vaccinations begin to roll out globally and discussions of ‘vaccine passports’ for travellers continue, hopes are building that a recovery can begin in the summer with the pent-up demand from the past year.”"
2021-02-09T00:01:57Z,business,Business,BA plans transatlantic flights partially fuelled by recycled waste in 2022,"British Airways says it will operate transatlantic flights partially powered by sustainable fuels as early as next year. BA will invest in a new US plant to be built in Georgia by LanzaJet producing commercial-scale volumes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), made from ethanol derived from agricultural and other waste. The airline said the fuel would create 70% less carbon emissions than conventional jet fuel. However, it is likely to only provide a tiny fraction of BA’s overall fuel needs at first. SAF can be used to substitute for up to 50% of conventional jet fuel but so far demonstration flights – such as one conducted in 2018 by Virgin Atlantic with LanzaTech (from which LanzaJet was spun off) – have blended only about 5% of the greener fuel. BA’s owner, IAG, which has pledged to invest almost £300m in SAF as part of its pledge to decarbonise by 2050, said it would investigate building a refinery with LanzaTech in the UK, as well as a waste-to-fuel plant in partnership with Velocys. The announcement came as the Dutch airline KLM claimed a world first in using sustainable synthetic kerosene on a commercial flight from Amsterdam to Madrid. Shell made 500 litres – just over 5% of the flight’s overall fuel burn – synthesised from CO2 and water using renewable energy sources. Pieter Elbers, the chief executive of KLM, said: “The transition from fossil fuel to sustainable alternatives is one of the largest challenges in aviation. This first flight on synthetic kerosene shows that it is possible in practice and that we can move forward.” BA said it expects the LanzaJet fuel to “be available to power a number of its flights by the end of 2022”. Its chief executive, Sean Doyle, said: “Following the successful startup of the Georgia plant, we hope to then deploy the technology and SAF production capacity in the UK.” But he added: “We need government support to drive decarbonisation and accelerate the realisation of this vision.” BA and LanzaTech are part of the Jet Zero Council, launched to some fanfare by Boris Johnson last year with an ambitious – if technically unfeasible – challenge to built a zero-emission long-haul jet.
The government has been forced into an embarrassing climbdown after the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, last week rebuffed accusations of inaction, telling the Commons that the council had met twice already. Shapps has now admitted it only met once, on the day it was launched last July. Mike Kane, the shadow aviation minister, said: “The transport secretary claimed the government’s Jet Zero Council was a ‘huge step forward in making change’, so it’s disappointing to say the least that he doesn’t know the most basic details of its work. “If ministers are serious about achieving sustainability in aviation and tackling the climate crisis, they need to focus on making real progress, not just paying lip service.”"
2021-02-09T00:01:11Z,business,Business,UK lockdown reduces consumer spending to lowest levels since last spring,"Britain’s tough new lockdown measures have dented consumer confidence and reduced spending to levels not seen since last spring, according to two separate surveys. Both the British Retail Consortium and Barclaycard said spending in January was at its weakest since May as booming online activity failed to compensate fully for the closure of stores. One of Britain’s leading thinktanks, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), added on Monday that after the UK’s sluggish start to 2021 it had cut its forecast for growth this year and put back the start of the recovery. Barclaycard said consumer spending last month was down by more than 16% year-on-year, while the monthly BRC/KPMP retail sales monitor showed that 63% of all non-food shopping took place online in January – a doubling from the 31% seen a year previously. Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive, said: “January saw retail sales growth decline to its lowest level since May of last year. The current lockdown has hit non-essential retailers harder than in November, with the new variant hampering consumer confidence and leading customers to hold back on spending – especially on clothing and footwear.” Raheel Ahmed, Barclaycard’s head of consumer products, said: “As the impact of the latest lockdown start to takes its toll, we’ve seen particular sectors struggle, as physical premises across the UK were forced to close. Last month’s glimmer of hope for the travel sector also seems to have stalled as tougher border controls saw bookings drop.” In its quarterly update, the NIESR said it now expected the economy to grow by 3.4% in 2021 compared with the 5.9% it had been expecting in November. The NIESR said the UK would be one of the weakest advanced economies in the first three months of 2021. It believes unemployment will rise sharply after the government’s furlough scheme ends in April and will reach 2.5m – or 7.5% of the workforce – by the end of the year. “To prevent a rise in unemployment of the magnitude of the forecast, and to limit the economic and social ‘scarring’ from the public health crisis, the chancellor should soon announce policies to support the labour market beyond April,” it said. The thinktank was less optimistic than the Bank of England about the time it would take for the economy to recover fully from the pandemic, predicting that it would take until late 2023 before output was back to the level reached in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Last week, Threadneedle Street said it envisaged a return to pre-Covid 19 levels by the start of 2022 but the NIESR said uncertainty about future variants of the coronavirus, continued physical distancing, more trade barriers with the EU as a result of Brexit and the weakness of productivity in the years before the pandemic would mean only a gradual recovery. Hande Küçük, a NIESR deputy director, said it would take time to make up the lost ground, just as it had after the global financial crisis of 2008-09 when it took five years to return to the pre-recession peak."
2021-02-08T20:23:13Z,business,Business,Bank governor takes responsibility for regulatory failings over LC&F scandal,"The governor of the Bank of England has told MPs that he takes responsibility for regulatory failings over the £237m London Capital & Finance investment scandal, and that he wished he could have spared the “suffering” of those who lost money. Andrew Bailey, who was formerly the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), also revealed that he did not know about LC&F “until pretty much the point it was closed down” by the City regulator. Bailey, who took over as th Bank governor in March 2020, was being questioned by MPs a week after the head of an independent inquiry into the matter said the Treasury needed to consider whether Bailey should face “consequences” over the FCA’s failure to properly regulate the firm before it went under. More than 11,600 people had invested a total of £237m when LC&F collapsed in January 2019. Its “mini-bonds” had promised returns to investors of up to 8% a year. Just before Christmas an inquiry led by Dame Elizabeth Gloster, a former high court judge, concluded that the FCA failed to properly supervise and regulate LC&F. During the second in a series of evidence sessions on the LC&F scandal, MPs on the Treasury select committee put it to Bailey that Gloster’s findings about the FCA were “very damning”, and asked which failings he took personal responsibility for. Bailey replied: “I actually take responsibility for all of the FCA, for the entirety of the FCA – there’s no question about that … So I don’t want to in any sense suggest I’m not responsible for everything that happened at the FCA. I am.” He added: “There are a lot of lessons for all of us.” Bailey was later asked about “one thing that you could have done differently”. He replied: “Straightforwardly, I would have wished that we could have saved the bondholders the suffering that they have had. There’s no question of that – it’s why I structured my apology as I did.” Bailey was the chief executive of the FCA from July 2016 until March 2020. He told the MPs: “I didn’t know about LC&F as a firm until pretty much the point it was closed down by the FCA. So my personal involvement didn’t begin until then.” Bailey also highlighted problems relating to the regulator’s call centre, which received just over 600 calls about LC&F, some pointing to “suspected fraud”. These included 15 from one individual voicing detailed concerns. However, the call centre was receiving about 200,000 calls a year, he said. “The red flags were buried in the 200,000 calls … There was no proper system for extracting that information.” Bailey said that there “should have been a mechanism to alert supervision and enforcement” to those.
The call centre problems were exacerbated by “very high” staff turnover and quite high staff sickness rates. Bailey said one of the reasons for this was “the abuse that staff were taking”. He added: “They put together a tape for us … that tape is highly disturbing, and it was happening with some frequency. The tape had in it racial abuse, antisemitic abuse, homophobic abuse.” Bailey said: “I have to hold my hand up – I wish I’d known about it sooner. I have to be honest with you, yes, I wish I’d known about it sooner because … I would have jumped in and got on it sooner.” The government-backed Gloster investigation’s report identified “significant gaps and weaknesses” in the regulator’s policies and practices, and stated that “responsibility for the failure in respect of the FCA’s approach to its perimeter rests with ExCo [the FCA’s executive committee] and Mr Bailey”."
2021-02-08T19:46:30Z,business,Business,Tesla should stick to what it's good at – and that isn't bitcoin | Nils Pratley,"Tweeting excitedly about bitcoin is one thing; spending $1.5bn (£1.1bn) of shareholders’ funds on the cryptocurrency is another. If Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive and 20% owner, can’t resist the urge to speculate, shouldn’t he be using his own money rather than shareholders’? Tesla’s audit committee has approved the “investment” as a way to “further diversify and maximise returns on our cash”, which is a heroically breezy way to describe the difference in the profile of risks. Accumulating a large hoard of bitcoins for your treasury operation is not like, say, authorising diversification into Swiss francs. As Tesla’s statement had to concede: “The prices of digital assets have been in the past and may continue to be highly volatile.” Nor, from a risk-management perspective, does it matter that Tesla plans to accept payment in bitcoins. You still don’t have to place roughly 10% of your cash balances in a cryptocurrency prone to wild swings in value. If punters choose to buy their electric cars with bitcoins, that’s their choice. The prudent approach for Tesla would be to convert such payments immediately into dollars or other currencies in which it incurs costs. The move, then, looks like pure speculation. It’s worked fine so far, since Tesla will be sitting on a tidy paper profit as a result of its purchases of bitcoin. And, Musk’s crew might argue, $1.5bn is not much in the context of a company worth $800bn. Come on, though – this adventure looks to be mostly about Musk’s taste for disruption and publicity. The winners are the promoters of bitcoin, who can say cryptocurrencies are reaching the mainstream of the financial system. But it’s not obvious what Tesla gets out of it, other than a small but still significant financial risk. The company should stick to what it’s good at – electric cars, energy-storing batteries and so on. Leave punting on bitcoin to the devotees. BP pays price for delay BP – finally – is in the UK offshore wind business, but the prices it is paying for two leases in the Irish Sea won’t lessen shareholders’ worry that latecomers to the renewables game must pay a premium to gain entry. The option rights amount to £231m a year per 1.5 gigawatt lease for BP and its joint venture partner, Energie Baden-Wüerttemberg of Germany, sums far higher than the ones the crown estate achieved for windy acreages of equivalent size over in the North Sea. BP could argue that its patches are more attractive because the waters are particularly shallow, making construction a breeze (ho ho) for a specialist in deep-water drilling. Well, maybe, but Ørsted, the Danish leader in windfarms, warned of “unsustainably high front-end costs” in the auction, which is not what BP’s investors wanted to hear. The real test is whether the projects deliver the 8%-10% returns on capital that the BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, has promised. The company is confident, but the more BP can say about its financial assumptions, the better. This is the company’s second big deal in offshore wind – the other was with Equinor in the US – and there will be more to come as the push for renewables accelerates. But BP hasn’t obviously bagged a bargain yet. Bailey bruised but unbroken Andrew Bailey did a decent job of painting the Financial Conduct Authority, circa 2016, as a snoozy regulator that wouldn’t recognise a financial scandal happening under its own nose. Try this detail from Monday’s session at the Treasury select committee, where the current governor of the Bank of England tried to explain how the FCA, when he was in charge, missed the £236m London Capital & Finance disaster for so long. There was, said Bailey, no mechanism for extracting information coming into the FCA’s call centres. Thus the many “red flag” warnings about LC&F were ignored. It’s astonishing: a call centre that takes calls but doesn’t act on them. This characterisation, though, chimes with Dame Elizabeth Gloster’s description of the FCA as “a broken machine” at the time Bailey was appointed. He sounded approving. What he didn’t like was Gloster’s more important point that top executives at the regulator – Bailey included – should have moved faster to fix the defects. Since it took until late 2018 for the FCA to realise that LC&F was, in fact, a disaster, Gloster’s criticism feels wholly legitimate: leadership is about choosing priorities. But do not be surprised if this affair now fizzles away. The select committee found no new information. Bailey, one suspects, will emerge bruised but still the governor."
2021-02-08T18:19:42Z,business,Business,Mike Ashley's Frasers Group sells stake in French Connection,"Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group has offloaded its 25% stake in French Connection to a Newcastle-based property investor after the fashion retailer’s share price shot up on hopes of a takeover. Frasers sold its 24.1m shares for up to £3.8m on Thursday, when French Connection’s shares surged by more than a third at one point.
The unusual stock movement forced the company to announce it had received approaches from two interested parties on Friday. Shares in the company then rose by a further 90% that day, so Frasers missed out on about £3.4m in additional gains. John Stevenson, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said French Connection was another example of an Ashley stock market investment that had “not gone brilliantly”, with the fashion group’s share price lower than it was five years ago, when he first built up the stake. Frasers, formerly known as Sports Direct, lost £150m when Debenhams went into administration in 2019, while another investment, Goals Soccer Centre, was forced to delist after an accounting scandal. “With hindsight, I’m sure [Ashley] would have liked to have sold at a higher price, but it is not a game-changer,” Stevenson said. “French Connection fitted quite well with [Frasers] brands, but you couldn’t see it being relinquished, so there was nowhere to go.” French Connection formally sought a buyer in 2019 but the process was not successful, as Ashley and other interested parties were unable to secure a deal with Stephen Marks, the founder, chairman and chief executive of French Connection. Marks remains key to its future as he still owns a near-42% stake. The Frasers Group stake was bought by the Newcastle-based businessman Apinder Singh Ghura. It is understood that Ghura, who spent years in the clothing industry before shifting into other investments including property and care homes, is not linked to either party announced as interested in buying French Connection last week. He says he does not plan to launch a bid but is leaving his options open. He said: “We used to supply the high street but we can’t be doing that now. I like to invest in things I understand and clothing is something I have been doing for a long time. To me this is a good investment and a good brand.” Ghura, who will already have made a paper profit of millions of pounds on the share buy, will now be key to any deal alongside Marks.
French Connection confirmed it had been approached by Spotlight Brands, with backing from the restructuring and investment firm Gordon Brothers. Spotlight has backed British brands including the fitness-focused Sweaty Betty, while Gordon Brothers acquired the Laura Ashley brand last year following its administration. Spotlight Brands is vying against the brand investment platform Go Global Retail, which is in partnership with HMJ International Services. Ashley’s group had been expected to take control of French Connection after beginning to build a significant stake. The retailer, which Marks founded in 1972, also owns the Great Plains brand and operates 68 stores and concessions in the UK as well as many overseas outlets. It employs about 780 staff. The company recorded a £7.3m pre-tax loss in its last annual results on the back of at least five further years of losses."
2021-02-08T16:30:48Z,business,Business,Australia's spending habits reveal just how weak the economy was in 2020 | Greg Jericho,"The final retail trade figures for 2020 show that despite some big monthly surges in spending, 2020 was a horror year. Retail trade has been truly bizarre since the pandemic hit. In a normal recession, people have less to spend and thus retail spending takes a hit. And yet last year total retail spending went up more strongly than it has for well over a decade. In December we spent 9.6% more in the shops than we did in December 2019. Before the pandemic, the last time we saw such growth was way back in 2004:
Graph not displaying? Click here It looks like a bonanza! What recession?! Consider that even the restaurant, cafe and takeaway sector, which was absolutely smashed by the pandemic and lockdowns, had turnover in December just 2.1% below that of December 2019. Now yes, that is bad, but not unprecedented. It was that bad back in 2011 – and much better than the 50% fall we saw in April last year.
And yet this is where we get beguiled by the monthly figures, and forget that that is not how life operates. If you run a restaurant or cafe, sure, it was good that December was not as bad as April, but that doesn’t mean the loss of income from April is no longer there:
Graph not displaying? Click here This is where looking at the total turnover throughout the whole year gives us a much more interesting and realistic picture of what happened last year. For while turnover for cafes and restaurants in December 2020 was just 2.1% below that of December 2019, the entire amount of turnover in 2020 was 15% below that recorded in 2019:
Graph not displaying? Click here Similarly, spending on clothing and personal accessories was down 8.5% in 2020 compared with 2019 – the worst annual fall ever recorded. Household goods and furniture went gangbusters – up a stunning 17% – but department stores, which were much more affected by lockdowns, saw no increase at all. And while that huge increase in spending on household goods had a large impact on overall spending, it was dwarfed by the impact of our increased spending on food items. Of the $20.3bn more we spent in 2020 on retail than in 2019, $15.7bn of it was in grocery stores:
Graph not displaying? Click here As we all know, the pandemic brought on an absolute stampede to grocery stores – and it continued throughout the year whenever any fears of a lockdown occurred, and even during the lockdowns as we were limited on where we could go to spend. What we saw in 2020 was a massive reallocation of our spending habits – away from non-retail items (because, for example, we were unable to spend on holidays) – and towards groceries and household goods. Last year we spent a larger share of our retail spending in grocery stores than ever before. Over the past decade we normally spend about 41% of our retail spending on groceries – last year that went up to 43.2%:
Graph not displaying? Click here We spent a greater share on household goods than we had since 2008, but less on clothing than ever before and the least on eating out than any year since 2002. The thing is, spending money on groceries, while certainly helpful for the economy, is not a very good indicator of economic health. We need food and groceries such as toilet paper – that we are spending more on necessities than luxuries does not suggest a thriving economy. And so it is more useful to look at the growth of total non-food spending in 2020 to get a better picture of things. Normally there is little difference between the growth of total retail and total “non-food” retail spending, because the growth of how much we spend on groceries is much less erratic than other items:
Graph not displaying? Click here But in 2020 the abnormal increase in spending on groceries, and the drop of spending on clothing and eating out, meant that there was a large difference between the growth of total retail and total non-food retail spending:
Graph not displaying? Click here We only spent 2.4% more in 2020 on non-food retail than we did in 2019 – a pretty weak increase. But while the amount of dollars spent is important, when we’re looking at the strength of the economy overall – such as GDP growth – we care more about the volume of things we bought. And when we look at the volume of non-food items bought we see the real weakness of the economy in 2020. While the volume of total retail bought in 2020 was 2.5% above the level of 2019 – a fairly unspectacular if decent level of growth – when we exclude food items, that growth falls to just 0.5% – the worst result since 1991:
Graph not displaying? Click here So yes, the impact of jobkeeper and jobseeker bonuses did keep retail businesses afloat in circumstances which normally would have led to massive falls. But we should not be beguiled by monthly surges. Spending overall, outside grocery stores, in 2020 was terrible and reflected the very weak economy."

2021-02-08T14:58:08Z,business,Business,HSBC urged to unfreeze accounts of Hong Kong activist,"An international group of senior politicians have written to the chairman of HSBC, Mark Tucker, urging him unfreeze bank accounts linked to a high-profile pro-democracy activist from Hong Kong. More than 50 members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China – including representatives from the UK, Canada, Australia, France, Germany and Switzerland – are calling for the immediate release of funds belonging to Ted Hui and his family, and a formal explanation of HSBC’s decision to freeze their accounts. The letter, which was first reported in the Times on Monday and is signed by politicians from 16 countries, including the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, asks HSBC to publicly commit to protecting the accounts of customers who are facing “politically motivated charges issued by the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities”. It heaps pressure on HSBC, which has come under fire for backing China’s controversial security law in Hong Kong, and subsequently freezing the accounts of pro-democracy protesters such as Hui who critics say are the real target of China’s crackdown. Hui – a veteran activist and former member of the Hong Kong legislative council – fled to Britain late last year. HSBC froze his accounts in early December, shortly after Hong Kong police accused him of misappropriating funds and money laundering. Despite a brief reversal, HSBC accounts held by Hui and his family are still frozen. The letter said the freezing of the accounts was “detrimental not only to Hui and his family’s wellbeing but also gravely tarnish HSBC’s reputation as a socially responsible enterprise operating under the rule of law. These actions undermine the open societies and free economies that underpin HSBC’s success.” HSBC refused to comment on Hui’s case, but emphasised that it was not in a position to question requests from local police. “Like every bank, we have to operate within the law and legal frameworks of all the countries in which we operate,” it said. “When we get a specific legal instruction by police authorities in Hong Kong, or anywhere else, to freeze the accounts of somebody under formal investigation, we have no choice but to comply. Disobeying such an order would be a criminal offence.”"
2021-02-08T14:42:15Z,business,Business,Queen's property manager and Treasury to get windfarm windfall of nearly £9bn,"The Queen and the Treasury could receive an offshore windfarm windfall of up to £9bn over the next decade, after an auction of seabed plots attracted runaway bids from energy companies including the oil company BP. The crown estate’s first auction of its seabed licences in a decade will earn the Queen’s property manager £879m a year, for up to 10 years, and clear the way for six new offshore windfarms and enough clean electricity generation for more than 7m homes. Under current rules, the crown estate hands its profits to the Treasury before 25% is returned to the royal household in the form of the sovereign grant – a funding formula that is due to be reviewed next year. The existing arrangements would more than double the profits made by the Queen and the Treasury from the crown estate, which reported profits of £345m for the last financial year. The Treasury would be in line for up to £659m a year from offshore wind after handing the Queen a share worth close to £220m a year to run the official royal household and pay for repairs to Buckingham Palace. The sum payable to the royal household would be well above the £86m grant in the current financial year – and lead to payments of up to £2bn over 10 years – unless the Treasury decides to adjust the rules next year. The sovereign grant was increased in 2017, from its previous level of 15%, to pay for extensive renovations at Buckingham Palace which are likely to run until 2027. It will stay at 25% at least until the next five-year review in 2021-22.
The crown estate’s windfall comes after it received record-breaking bids from energy companies, including big oil and gas producers, hoping to build offshore windfarms off the coast of England and Wales. Oil company BP and its partner, the Germany utility EnBW, will pay £462m a year for the option to develop two offshore windfarms in the Irish Sea, capable of powering more than 3.4m UK households with clean electricity. BP claims it will avoid paying the option fee for the maximum 10-year term by making a final investment decision on the project within four years, and generating electricity from its turbines after seven. At this point the “rent” due to the crown estate would fall to 2% of the windfarm’s annual turnover. Dev Sanyal, the head of BP’s renewable energy business, said he was very confident the company would be able to use its experience delivering multibillion-pound offshore projects to make returns of 8% to 10% on its investment, despite the high upfront cost to the crown estate.
The size of the crown estate’s windfall has reignited calls for the profits of the offshore wind industry to be channelled into a “green sovereign wealth fund” that could invest in more green energy projects or local communities. The Green party co-leader, Jonathan Bartley, said the initial capital from a renewable windfall could be invested “for future generations, similar to what we’ve seen the likes of Alaska and Norway do in the past with their oil wealth”. “The boom in value of the right to develop offshore wind is so welcome – a signal that the transition away from fossil fuels is happening at speed. But we need to ensure that the value of this national resource is shared fairly and invested for all our futures,” he said.
The crown estate had hoped to avoid a “runaway” auction by overhauling the auction rules in 2019, but industry players that lost out in the recent bidding round claim the changes did not go far enough and allowed for “bonkers” prices that could inflate the cost of the UK meeting its climate targets. The renewable energy arm of Germany’s RWE won the option to develop two offshore windfarms in the Dogger Bank area off the coast of North Yorkshire at a cost of £248m a year, and a joint venture between the French oil company Total and the Green Investment Group won the option to develop a windfarm at a cost of £125m a year. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the energy minister, said the crown estate’s latest leasing round would help power 7m homes and assist the UK in eliminating its contribution to carbon emissions by 2050 while “creating thousands of new jobs and ensuring Britain builds back greener”."
2021-02-08T08:13:05Z,business,Business,"Boohoo buys Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Wallis for £25m","The online fashion retailer Boohoo has bought Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton for £25m, completing the breakup of Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group. The deal to buy the three remaining fashion brands out of administration does not include any of their 214 UK stores, which will permanently close and put about 2,450 jobs at risk. Nor does it include the group’s Outfit chain, which sold products from all Arcadia brands from its 65 stores. These stores will permanently close, with the loss of hundreds more jobs. Boohoo said on Monday that it had agreed to buy “the e-commerce and digital assets and associated intellectual property rights, including customer data, related business information and inventory of the Burton, Dorothy Perkins and Wallis brands”. Only 260 head office roles – involved in design, buying, merchandising and digital operations – will be transferred to Boohoo under the deal. The shop workers union Usdaw said the sale of Arcadia’s remaining brands to an online specialist was “another devastating blow for our high streets”. It called for a joined-up plan, involving unions, employers and government, to help the struggling retail sector, and backed calls for increased taxes on online retailers. Dave Gill, Usdaw’s national officer, said: “Retail is crucial to our town and city centres; it employs around three million people across the UK. The government must take this seriously; we need a recovery plan to get the industry back on its feet.” The Manchester-based company said the takeover would be completed by Tuesday and that all three brands would be fully integrated by May this year. The deal comes only weeks after Boohoo bought the Debenhams brand in a £55m deal that also excluded its high street sites, leading to the likely loss of up to 12,000 jobs. Boohoo revealed in January it was in exclusive talks to buy Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton, as administrators at Deloitte sought buyers for the remaining brands in the Arcadia empire, which went into administration last year. The online retailer Asos bought the Arcadia brands Topshop, Topman and Miss Selfridge last week for £330m. The brands-only deal did not include any of the stores or warehouses. At least 2,500 high street shop workers are at risk of losing their jobs as a result of that deal. Arcadia’s plus-size clothing brand, Evans, was sold to the Australian retailer City Chic Collective for £23m in December.
So far, administrators have raised more than £500m from selling Arcadia’s assets, which will be distributed to the company’s creditors. A report by the administrators, seen by the Guardian, suggested Green’s family was likely to receive £50m from the sale of Topshop, relating to an interest-free loan it made to the group in 2019 at the time of an emergency restructure which is secured against the group’s Daventry warehouse. However, more than 1,000 suppliers and landlords to the high street fashion chain are expected to get less than 1% of the money owed to them. Boohoo shares closed down almost 5% at 347p. Boohoo also confirmed on Monday that it was ordering its Leicester-based suppliers to stop using outside labour and subcontractors and bring all clothes-making in house by 5 March."
2021-02-08T06:01:32Z,business,Business,"Reform business rates or risk a high street collapse, say firms","The leaders of household names including Tesco, B&Q and Waterstones have warned the chancellor that the business rates burden on shops is putting thousands of high street jobs at risk, and called for online retailers to pay their “fair share” of tax. In a letter to Rishi Sunak before next month’s budget, the chief executives of 18 retail and property organisations, representing more than a million employees and tens of thousands of shops, say failing to overhaul the commercial equivalent of council tax will hamper the ability of high streets and town centres to recover from the pandemic. The letter, which is also signed by the bosses of Asda and Morrisons as well as major shopping centre operator Hammerson, says the current system is “not sustainable in the long term and without reform, shops at the heart of communities will be at risk”. “We urge you to use the upcoming budget to commit to fundamental reform of business rates focused on reducing the burden on retailers and levelling the playing field between bricks and mortar and online businesses,” they say. The letter comes as the Treasury explores options for an online sales tax in response to the explosion in internet shopping since the pandemic to help stem the collapse of the high street. Tesco – which is one of the biggest payers of the property-based tax – is calling for a 1% online sales tax to be imposed, alongside business rates reform. “We believe strongly that there should be a level playing field for all retailers, online or physical, which is why we propose a 1% online sales levy for businesses with annual revenues over £1m, in addition to a 20% reduction in business rates,” a Tesco spokesperson said. “Now is the opportunity to reform business rates and create a system that is fair and sustainable for all.” Tesco has previously suggested the government impose a 2% online sales tax to help pay for a cut in business rates for shops. Other retail executives have proposed a “business rate levy” on retailers based on their sales. The government launched a fundamental review of the property tax last year and is due to report back in the spring. A Treasury spokesman said: “We want to see thriving high streets, which is why we’ve spent tens of billions of pounds supporting shops throughout the pandemic and are supporting town centres through the changes online shopping brings. “Our business rates review calls for evidence including questions on whether we should shift the balance between online and physical shops by introducing an online sales tax. We’re considering responses now.” Business rates raise about £30bn for the Treasury each year, of which £8bn is paid by retailers. Since April, retailers have benefited from a 12-month rates holiday during the pandemic, but are worried about the resumption this year of a system that “penalised physical shops”. Supermarkets and discounters reluctantly relinquished the emergency tax break after their stores stayed open during lockdowns.
The CEO of Waterstones, James Daunt, says business rates on shops are “a perverse tax, perversely applied”. “It is starkly evident that they result in the loss of jobs and the degradation of communities most in need of support. They are indefensible in their present form, with the immediate consequence of failure to reform the certain loss of tens of thousands of valuable jobs,” Daunt said. While sales at online retailers such as Amazon have boomed during the pandemic lockdowns have accelerated the hollowing out of high streets and town centres. The recent rescue deals brokered for Topshop owner Arcadia and Debenhams will result in the permanent closure of more than 500 stores and the loss of more than 20,000 high street jobs.
Business rates are calculated by multiplying a property’s rental value by the multiplier (the number of pence-per-pound of rateable value you need to pay in tax). Bills have risen steeply in recent years partly because the 2015 revaluation of property values was delayed until 2017. The multiplier has also risen from 34.8p in the pound in 1990 to more than 50p for stores paying more than £51,000 in rent. The letter proposes that the multiplier is reduced to its original level. The retail executives argue that online retailers pay a lower proportion of rates per sale than bricks and mortar retailers and the government should rebalance the “system to ensure online retailers pay a fair share of tax”. This would not affect the tax take and “provide a vital boost to bricks and mortar retailers”, they argue. An Amazon spokesperson said: “We’ve invested more than £23bn in jobs and infrastructure in the UK since 2010. Last year we created 10,000 new jobs and last week we announced 1,000 new apprenticeships. This continued investment helped contribute to a total tax contribution of £1.1bn during 2019 – £293m in direct taxes and £854m in indirect taxes.”"
2021-02-08T06:01:31Z,business,Business,Debt levels soar for business as UK economy struggles to recover from Covid,"Britain’s economy is facing a lengthy recovery from the third coronavirus lockdown amid soaring levels of business debt after almost a year of economic turmoil caused by the pandemic. Figures from the accountancy firm EY show British businesses took on debt at more than twice the normal average growth rate since the crisis began and are on course to have borrowed £61bn in total by the end of 2021. Faced with prolonged lockdown restrictions at the start of the year as persistently high Covid infections delay a return to normal, EY forecast a £26bn rise in borrowing from banks this year – as much as £17bn more than in 2019. The government announced last week that businesses struggling during the pandemic would be given more time to make repayments on state-backed loans. The new offer includes the option of paying sums back over 10 years rather than six, and allowing firms to choose to pay only the 2.5% interest. However, the scale of new debts taken on by firms could hold back Britain’s economic recovery, and lead to weaker investment if firms prioritise bringing down debt levels. Anna Anthony, UK financial services managing partner at EY, said the “colossal amount” of borrowing was mainly being used to help companies survive, rather than to fund growth. “The prospect of some, if not many firms, not being able make the required repayments is concerning for all involved,” she said. The warning comes as economic activity plunged in January by the most since the first wave of the pandemic. Business surveys from NatWest and the accountancy firm BDO show that tougher lockdown measures at the start of the year triggered a broad-based contraction in business activity. Although companies remained optimistic about the outlook, reflecting progress in administering the Covid vaccine, and amid hopes for looser restrictions in the months ahead, demand for goods and services fell across the UK. NatWest said the biggest fall was recorded in Scotland, while employment levels also fell in all 12 regions of the UK monitored by the bank. The BDO Output Index, which measures data from the UK’s main business surveys, fell to 70.44 in January, the lowest level in seven months on a scale where figures above 95 indicate economic growth. The gauge averaged 73.62 in 2020, well below the previous low of 83.28 recorded in 2009. The government is drawing up plans for easing coronavirus restrictions in the spring that are expected to be unveiled before the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, uses the 3 March budget to announce support measures designed to kickstart the economic recovery. However, manufacturers are preparing for a long-haul recovery, with half of firms in a survey by MakeUK expecting it would take until at least 2022 for them to return to full production capacity.
The lobby group said British industry needed support equivalent to the Marshall plan – aid paid by the US to western governments to help the economies of Europe after the second world war. The survey of 186 industrial companies showed more than a quarter believed it would take a year or longer to return to normal trading. Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of MakeUK, said support measures at the budget and a plan for a longer-term strategic vision was needed. Calling for the extension of the Treasury’s furlough scheme until at least September, as well as tax cuts to support business investment, he said: “We need an industrial strategy and vision on a scale not seen since the Marshall plan, which identifies new technologies and market openings that will benefit from enterprise-friendly policies on taxation, research and development, infrastructure and regional investment.”"
2021-02-07T18:24:32Z,business,Business,Rolls-Royce proposes short summer shutdown of jet-engine plants,"Rolls-Royce is proposing to temporarily close its jet-engine factories for two weeks this summer as it manages costs due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The aero-engine maker has begun talks with unions on the shutdown and cost cutting at its civil aerospace unit. “As we continue to manage our cost base in response to the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the whole commercial aviation sector, we are proposing a two-week operational shutdown of civil aerospace over the summer,” it said in an emailed statement.
Rolls-Royce’s finances have been hit by the Covid crisis as its airline customers have grounded planes. It warned last month that travel would be even more constrained than expected this year, leading to increased cash outflow. Rolls is expected to save tens of millions of pounds in wages, plus energy and other running costs. Staff have been told the two weeks’ pay they will lose will be spread across the year to minimise the impact on their income, according to the Sunday Telegraph which first reported the two-week summer shutdown. The move is expected to affect all 19,000 staff in Rolls’ international civil aerospace division, including 12,500 in the UK, who make jet engines for airliners. The emergence of more contagious variants of the Covid-19 virus have hit the travel industry’s hopes of a strong rebound in sales in 2021. Last month, Rolls-Royce flagged that these “more contagious variants of the virus were creating additional uncertainty”, as it cut its forecast for engine flying hours this year to about 55%, compared with pre-Covid levels in 2019.
“Enhanced restrictions are delaying the recovery of long-haul travel over the coming months compared to our prior expectations, placing further financial pressure on our customers and the wider aviation industry, all of which are impacting our own cashflows in 2021,” the company warned on 26 January. The UK government is aiming to have offered all UK adults aged 50 and older a first coronavirus vaccination by early May. But senior MPs warned last week that summer holidays abroad may not be possible unless other countries make better progress on vaccination. Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs select committee, said it was vital that Britain’s immunisation programme was protected. “The vaccine programme is immensely important and we need to make sure it’s protected against any threat from new variants, and there may be others as we go forward,” she said.
UK tour operators had reported that many customers are setting their sights on an October trip overseas, rather than summer holiday deals, suggesting that many Britons are planning to holiday within the UK this summer. Thomas Cook said 40% of its recent holiday bookings are for October onwards – compared with about 10% at the start of January, while Brittany Ferries reported that new bookings for summer 2021 are already 50% down on pre-Covid years, with some customers who have booked in advance starting to cancel. Reuters contributed to this report."
2021-02-07T15:59:26Z,business,Business,Online sales tax aims to 'shift balance' as UK high streets struggle,"The UK Treasury is exploring options for an online sales tax in response to an explosion in internet shopping, as the Covid-19 pandemic accelerates the closure of high street shops across the country. Officials said the Treasury was weighing changes to “shift the balance” between spending online and in physical shops, amid concerns in government over the impact for communities as more shops pull down their shutters for the last time. Record number of shops are disappearing from high streets as repeated lockdowns and a rapid growth in online sales hammer the retail sector, threatening to permanently alter the landscape of towns and cities after Covid restrictions have been relaxed. Ministers believe an online sales tax, which would involve a new levy on internet shopping, could help stem the collapse of the high street. Business groups including the British Retail Consortium have vocally opposed the measure, which they argue would hit high street retailers with online operations and result in higher costs for shoppers at a time of severe weakness in the British economy. However, several big retailers, including Tesco, have previously backed the launch of an online sales tax to redress the balance. According to the Sunday Times, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is supportive of such a move, but would probably wait until the autumn to launch a raid on internet firms such as Amazon, Asos and Ocado, rather than using the 3 March budget. The development comes as the Treasury considers evidence from retailers as part of a fundamental review of business rates – the system of taxing companies based on the physical premises they occupy – that is scheduled to conclude this spring. An online sales tax is being weighed as part of this work, officials said. A Treasury spokesman said: “We want to see thriving high streets, which is why we’ve spent tens of billions of pounds supporting shops throughout the pandemic and are supporting town centres through the changes online shopping brings. Our business rates review call for evidence included questions on whether we should shift the balance between online and physical shops by introducing an online sales tax. We’re considering responses now.” With many shops forced into temporary closure during lockdown and as shoppers stay away from high streets during the pandemic, official figures show the amount spent online increased by 46% in 2020 compared with a year earlier. Online spending now accounts for about 30% of overall retail sales in Britain, up from about 20% a year ago. In a further sign of the trend, Amazon’s UK sales rose by 51% last year to a reach $26.5bn (£19.4bn) as people staying at home during lockdown turned to the retailing giant to buy goods unavailable in the closed high streets. Analysts believe a permanently higher levels of online spending could be a lasting legacy of the pandemic.
Robert Hayton, UK president of property tax at the consultancy firm Altus Group, said the pandemic meant there was a need to “address the disparity” in taxes paid by retail firms with physical shops and those operating mainly online. He said Amazon had a “tax to turnover ratio” – the amount of tax as a proportion of revenue – of just 0.37%, compared with about 2.3% for traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers. An Amazon spokesperson said: “We’ve invested more than £23bn in jobs and infrastructure in the UK since 2010. Last year we created 10,000 new jobs and last week we announced 1,000 new apprenticeships. This continued investment helped contribute to a total tax contribution of £1.1 billion during 2019 – £293m in direct taxes and £854m in indirect taxes.”"
2021-02-07T12:21:48Z,business,Business,How to turn the UK's 'generation rent' into 'generation buy' | Larry Elliott,"Property is Britain’s obsession. As soon as the first lockdown ended there was a burst of activity in the housing market that only now seems to be tailing off. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, says if the only economic statistic available was the one for mortgage approvals you would never know there had been a pandemic raging in 2020. There was certainly a disparity between the strongest demand for home loans since 2007 and what was going on in the rest of the economy. Even after modest falls in January, prices are still rising at an annual rate of 5.4% according to the Halifax, and 6.4% according to Nationwide.
Prices are high because there is a structural imbalance between supply and demand. Every government arrives in office pledging to boost the number of new homes being built but the facts speak for themselves: in the 30 years from 1958 to 1988 around 7.5m homes were built in England. In the subsequent three decades the number more than halved to around 3.1m. The supply of homes is affected by tough green belt regulations, local planning rules and by the lack of a land value tax to deter hoarding. The UK is also a relatively small country with a growing population, so demand for homes is high, and there is a tendency for house prices to rise by more than the overall inflation rate. But last year, there were additional factors. Official interest rates were cut to record lows. Money pumped into the economy through the Bank of England’s quantitative easing programme boosted mortgage lending. Rishi Sunak decided that the property market needed a temporary cut in stamp duty. The lockdown made people yearn for a home with a garden. Finally, the government’s furlough scheme removed the one thing that would have prompted a house price crash: a big rise in unemployment. The big losers from this, as ever, are the young people trying to buy their first home. For them, the long-suffering members of generation rent, there is nothing to cheer about when prices spiral upwards, because it means they have to save for even longer to put down a deposit. Most people under 30 would see a big drop in house prices as a blessing not a curse. That possibility shouldn’t be ruled out entirely. The market is already softening because the stamp duty holiday had the effect of pulling forward to 2020 moves that would have taken place in 2021. Moreover, if Sunak seeks to withdraw stimulus too fast or there is another wave of infections, it is entirely feasible that there will be a tsunami of redundancies this spring and summer. More likely though, prices will either go up a bit or down a bit with big variations according to region and house type. Interest rates are not going to be raised any time soon and the supply-demand mismatch will continue. All of which means that the “Bank of Mum and Dad” is going to remain open for those fortunate enough to have an account there, and there will be pressure on the government to come up with schemes such as help to buy which provide subsidised loans for first-time buyers. A new help to buy scheme could be in next month’s Budget. But the Bank of Mum and Dad and help to buy both have the same effect: they drive up house prices and make life more difficult for those people without well-off parents or who can’t access state support. In this context, a new paper on how to address the challenges of the housing market and turning “generation rent” into “generation buy” written by the economist Gerard Lyons for the centre-right thinktank Policy Exchange merits attention. That’s not just because ministers often use Policy Exchange to float ideas. It is also because Lyons worked closely with Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London. It is clear he has been well briefed.
The paper says action is needed on both sides of the supply-demand equation. On the supply side, it calls for a housebuilding boom to provide affordable properties on “a massive scale”. On the demand side, it says that if more homes are to be built, then people need to be able to afford them and that means having access to finance. The problem, Lyons says, is not that generation rent can’t afford to keep up their mortgage payments – they have shown they can by paying rent to landlords. Rather, the issue is that they can’t raise the deposit needed to satisfy the tough requirements insisted upon by lenders. His solution is a form of blended mortgage product that would deliver 95% loan-to-value home loans but be provided by three different financial institutions. The riskiest part of the mortgage – the bit between 85% and 95% of the homes value – would be provided by investment banks; the middle chunk would be provided by retail banks and building societies, while the last part would be delivered by long-term investors such as pension funds. The paper supports the idea of a land value tax, and says the stamp duty holiday should become permanent, with no levy on lower-priced homes. Levels of owner-occupation fell from a peak of 71% in the early years of this century to 64% less than a decade and a half later and have remained there ever since. One of the (many) reasons why the Conservative party polls poorly among young people is that its policies have been tailored to suit the interests of older voters. Lyons says this needs to change. That, though, requires some difficult choices, because sorting out Britain’s housing mess is not just a technical matter: it is massively political."
2021-02-07T10:03:03Z,business,Business,"Britons set for a post-Covid spending binge, says Bank chief","The Bank of England is braced for the possibility that a mood of national depression that engulfed Britain as it plunged into a third national lockdown will end with a spending spree when restrictions are lifted. In an interview with the Observer, the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, said there was a chance after being cooped up for so long people would “go for it” once the vaccine programme allowed the economy to reopen. Bailey said that while the crisis of the past 12 months had accelerated the shift to online shopping and would change working patterns, the long-term structural impact on the economy would be less pronounced than the shift from manufacturing to services in the 1980s and 1990s. “It won’t be as fundamental as that”, he added. The governor added that the current lockdown – unanticipated by the Bank three months ago – had delayed progress on a new climate-change initiative, but insisted that Threadneedle Street was serious about tackling global heating. The Bank’s priority over the past few weeks had been to assess the impact of the tough measures announced by Boris Johnson at the turn of the year to control the rapid spread of the new variant of Covid-19. Bailey said the Bank’s monitoring of its own staff, almost all of whom are now, like him, working from home, had given him a feeling that the country had become markedly more downbeat at the turn of the year. “I could sense it from our institution. Hopes were raised by news on the vaccine, but then of course we had another lockdown and a big resurgence in Covid. The whole mood was pretty down, although it is alleviating now,” he said. The Bank believes the success of the vaccine programme will allow the economy to bounce back strongly after contracting by more than 4% in the first three months of 2021. Bailey said the hit was much smaller than in the first lockdown last spring because people had learned how to adapt. High Street banks and building societies have been given six months to prepare themselves for the possibility that Threadneedle Street will turn to negative interest rates to stimulate the economy, but the City is likely to see Bailey’s comments as an indication that such a radical step is a long way off, and may never happen. Interest rates were cut to a record low of 0.1% last March. Threadneedle Street is monitoring what households do with an estimated £125bn in extra savings they have accumulated since the start of the pandemic. The Bank expects only 5% of the total to be spent, but Bailey said it could be more. “The risk is on the upside – that after you lock people up for this long they go for it.” He added: “One interesting question is how much that desire to spend comes up against a supply side that doesn’t recover immediately.” As well as cutting interest rates, the Bank has sought to boost the economy through quantitative easing, under which financial institutions sell bonds to Threadneedle Street in return for money. Bailey said QE helped the economy by making lending cheaper and by generating increases in asset prices, which made people who owned houses and shares wealthier. While there was evidence of a growing gap between younger and older generations, he said: “It [QE] is working in the sense that the level of employment is higher than it otherwise would be and incomes are higher than they otherwise would be.” QE had been vital in stabilising financial markets during the first weeks of the crisis, the governor added. Last month, the Bank was criticised by the Commons environmental audit committee for its failure to make sure its purchases of corporate bonds under the QE scheme dovetailed with the Government’s commitment to a green recovery from the Covid crisis.
Bailey said the Bank would soon announce plans under which its bond-buying programme would incentivise companies to go green. Asked whether this might mean moving away from buying bonds issued by fossil fuel companies, the governor replied: “Yes, it could. We are serious about this issue and we are actively working on it now. We’ve got to turn words into actions.” He added: “The other good news is that we are seeing a very big shift of gears in the US and that will internationally increase the push for change.” With Britain chairing the G7 group of industrialised countries and the UN climate change talks this year, Bailey said he was “pretty optimistic” that progress would be made. While the Bank had predicted the outcome of Brexit trade talks, Bailey said it would take time to resolve differences over the treatment of financial services and the access of UK firms to the EU. “This is unfinished business,” he said."
2021-02-07T07:00:05Z,business,Business,Massive losses should be a warning to big oil that its bonanza is over,"The final months of 2020 were a tough end to a tough year, according to BP’s chief executive. But Bernard Looney’s verdict on the worst financial year in the industry’s history is a devastating understatement. It was a period marked by thousands of job cuts, battered dividend policies and record multibillion-dollar losses. BP revealed a full-year loss of $18bn, its first since the Deepwater Horizon disaster more than a decade ago, while US oil giant ExxonMobil reported an annual loss of $22.4bn – its first ever. Shell capped a year in which it slashed its dividend for the first time since the second world war with a debit of almost $20bn. The crushing decline of the oil industry during the Covid-19 pandemic may be unprecedented, but it is also a foreseeable outcome for fossil fuel producers in the years ahead. The race to create clean-burning biofuels and hydrogen to propel aircraft and seaborne tankers is gaining pace. At the same time, electric vehicles are accelerating into the mainstream. A green transport future is arriving faster than even the most optimistic environmentalists had hoped, and fossil fuel executives had feared.
Managers have a choice: they can view the 2020 collapse as an unprecedented event in the history of the industry, or a grim foreshadowing of its value in a world that no longer needs fossil fuels. Both are valid viewpoints, of course. But unless oil companies prepare today for a greener future, they face an indefinite number of dire financial years. There are some signs that the warning of 2020 has been heeded by the world’s biggest producers: companies including BP, Shell and Norway’s oil giant Equinor are taking an aggressive position within the offshore wind market, Shell is accelerating its move into electric vehicle charging, and all seem enamoured by the potential for a hydrogen economy. But the real trick to guarding against the risky future for fossil fuel production is to stop producing fossil fuels. None of the major oil companies seem ready to make that leap. They may want to hurry. For further proof, if it were needed, that the low-carbon race is advancing apace, turn your attention to the US comedy star Will Ferrell. The actor has – temporarily – traded in his big-screen gags for a General Motors television advert in which he vows to help the US beat Norway’s dominance in electric vehicles. The ad, which is due to run in the US during the Super Bowl, is perhaps the clearest sign that forgoing fossil fuels is no longer the niche pursuit of the eco-conscious. If the star of Anchorman is using the phrase “Norway is out EV-ing us” in one of the most-watched US television slots of the year, we can safely assume that electric vehicles have arrived in the hearts and minds of middle America. There will be Big Oil naysayers who insist that the road towards green transport will be more of a long and winding path than a motorway. That is to be expected: it comes from the same playbook used by the fossil-fuel industry when renewable energy began to emerge. Energy from the sun and the wind was once dismissed as being too expensive, too difficult to store, and technically incapable of playing a major role in the energy system. In a matter of years, renewable energy developers have quietly proved these theories wrong. Oil company bosses who believe there is one last hurrah for fossil fuels before the green renaissance takes hold may be proved wrong yet again, and this time there will be no excuses. Many warning shots have been fired in the green revolution, but none so loudly as in 2020. It’s time to bite the bullet. The economy is being boosted by the vaccine, but held back by Brexit lSince the UK mass vaccination programme began, the value of sterling has crept steadily higher against the euro. From a low of €1.09 on 11 December, the pound has risen to edge above €1.14. If the relative value of currencies are any guide to the future, it seems clear investors are betting on the UK having a brighter 2021 than the eurozone. The European Central Bank is likely to confirm this outlook when it meets next month, by downgrading the outlook for growth this year for the 19-member currency bloc from around 4% to nearer 3%. It will blame the delays in vaccination procurement for holding back what was at one stage predicted to be a robust recovery. Meanwhile, the Bank of England says a strong bounceback beckons in the second half of the year, resulting in 5% growth overall in 2021. But while a faster vaccination programme is significant, it is not the only issue affecting growth. When the figures are tallied, the UK will almost certainly have suffered a 10% contraction in 2020, much worse than the eurozone average of 6.8%. This means Britain starts 2021 from a weaker position than its neighbours. Government spending, and not just on health, also matters. At the moment, the Conservative party is heading towards setting a budget in March that will be dominated by talk of bringing down the public spending deficit as much as ways to boost the economy. The EU has no such concerns when much of its €750bn (£670bn) stimulus package has yet to be spent and its manufacturing base is motoring along, while the UK’s suffers an overload of Brexit trade bureaucracy. That means there are plenty of trip hazards ahead for both British and EU forecasters. Their predictions may be modified many times before the year is out. We need seek a seabed dividend As oil revenues plunge, the drilling giants are getting set for a switch to renewables. An auction of seabed plots for windfarms off the coasts of England and Wales has attracted record bids as new companies pile into the sector, with predictions that it will raise more than £4bn in licensing fees over the next decade. With Boris Johnson calling for every home in the UK to be powered by renewables by 2030, the seabed looks set to remain a major source of revenue for the British state. So the time has come for a debate on what the nation should do with this green windfall. As things stand, a quarter of the cash will go to the Queen. The other three-quarters will flow to the Treasury. A first step would be to reduce the monarch’s share of revenues from the Crown Estate, which manages all her property, including her rights to the seabed. At present she is entitled to 25% of Crown Estate income. The sum was increased from 15% in 2017 in order to help pay for repairs to Buckingham Palace. That decision should now be reversed – even a smaller share will be more than enough to pay for the rewiring. The bigger question is how the Treasury should manage its portion. Some, including the Green party, want the money invested for future generations. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund is a source of envy around the world, perhaps nowhere more so than in Britain. One of the largest state-owned nest eggs in the world, the oil fund – or Oljefondets – was created in 1990 from North Sea oil revenues and is now worth more than £700bn. The investment income is helping to pay for the pandemic. Margaret Thatcher’s government spent the takings from Britain’s 1980s oil boom by recycling them into cuts in taxes and welfare benefits. Had the money been put into a fund, the IPPR calculated a couple of years ago, it would be worth some £500bn today. The UK must make the most of this new opportunity."
2021-02-07T07:00:04Z,business,Business,The red wall should hear Hammond’s hard truths about Brexit | William Keegan,"I sincerely hope that it is only the lunatic fringe of Brexiters who do not accept that, having made the disastrous mistake of leaving the EU, this country should now try to align itself as closely as possible with the trading arrangements we have crassly abandoned. The chaos surrounding the “protocol” which is supposed to answer the latest manifestation of the Irish Question is the most extreme example of the damage caused by the rest of the UK leaving the single market. But for the past five weeks the obstacles arising from trying to unscramble the egg of our relationship with the rest of the European economy have been widely publicised, the reductio ad absurdum being the way in which businesses – in order to stay in business! – are finding it necessary to relocate some or all of their operations to continental Europe – in other words, within the single market. The European leaders whom Boris Johnson is happy to call “our friends and partners” – rich from a prime minister who has severed a historic partnership – made friendly overtures to the UK last weekend, notwithstanding the way this government stretched their patience to the limits during the Brexit negotiations. Unfortunately, and to the delight of the Brexiters, their overtures were drowned by the vaccine furore. The European commission’s plan to put an embargo on vaccine shipments from the EU to the UK was plain stupid: shortsighted and, mercifully, short-lived. But it has given rise to all sorts of nonsense about the putative “dividends” of Brexit. Which brings me to a most interesting interview given shortly before Christmas by the former chancellor Philip Hammond to the thinktank Britain in a Changing Europe. This was one of a series of interviews for the historical record with people who were close to government discussions over Brexit. In 2006, my old friend Sir Howard Davies, then director of the London School of Economics, had the bright idea of inviting former chancellors to reminisce in tranquillity about their time in office, in a series called – echoes of Chaucer – The Chancellors’ Tales. I see Hammond’s interview as a worthy continuation – not least because it has prompted a savage riposte from one Nick Timothy, who was Theresa May’s chief of staff, and, like May, does not emerge well from Hammond’s account. In Chaucerian terms, Timothy hardly counts as a “parfit gentil knight”. I shall spare you the intemperate language he uses.
Not to put too fine a point on it, both Hammond and his officials concluded that May and Timothy had precious little clue about the economic and trading dangers of Brexit, and were obsessed by immigration from the rest of the EU – immigration, by the way, that produced economic benefits, a flow that has now been reversed, with deleterious consequences reported by many businesses. Hammond explains that he was not a Remainer for the kind of cultural reasons – as well as economic – that influenced people such as his predecessor Ken Clarke, and, for that matter, yours truly. No, he became a strong Remainer during his time as foreign secretary, when he saw how much influence for good the UK exerted in Brussels. In one important passage he notes that the then cabinet secretary, Jeremy Heywood, told May “of the extent to which the British economy, for better or worse, had become utterly dependent on its European supply chains and its European customs base, almost without us noticing.” (My italics.) Well, everyone is noticing now. And, in addition to the businesses that are suffering, Hammond predicts “the cost … will be pretty much 100% absorbed by exactly the demographic profile that voted Leave, then voted for Boris Johnson, having never voted Tory before.” A theme of Hammond’s story is how, throughout the Cameron-May-Johnson premierships, the tail – the extreme Brexit lot who call themselves the European Research Group – wagged the prime ministerial dog. We are seeing something similar now in the way that the Labour leadership seems obsessed by the need to pacify the so-called “red wall” voters referred to by Hammond. Keir Starmer has been on the case of the many disastrous decisions made, or not made, by Johnson before the apparent success of the vaccine came to No 10’s political rescue. But Starmer was right all along about the absurdity of Brexit and should be hammering this home. One way or another we need proper access to the single market. Among others, our musicians realise this. Perhaps the pro-European cause needs the kind of help that the footballer Marcus Rashford brought to the issue of school meals. Elton John and Sting have made a start. Let’s have more!"
2021-02-07T06:39:34Z,business,Business,Travel website Lastminute.com  ‘failed over its refund pledge’,"The travel booking website Lastminute.com has broken the promise it made to the regulator to repay all outstanding refunds to holidaymakers, a Which? investigation has revealed. After months of breaking the law on cancelled holiday refunds, the online travel agent was investigated by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in December. By then, its customers were owed more than £7m in refunds. Lastminute.com then promised the regulator it would refund all package holidays that were cancelled on or before 2 December 2020 by the end of January 2021. But despite this commitment, Which?, the consumer magazine, has found evidence some customers still had not received refunds by the January deadline, with several receiving only partial reimbursements – often, for hotel stays, but not flights. “The CMA was right to intervene to demand action from the online travel agent, but after failing some of its customers again, tougher measures need to be taken,” said Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel. “The CMA should uncover how many customers were not refunded in time and take action.” Under the package travel and linked travel arrangements regulations 2018, if a package holiday is cancelled by the provider, the customer is entitled to a full refund within 14 days. A package holiday is defined as a combination of at least two types of travel booked together with one provider. A spokesperson for Lastminute.com said the refund process has been “very complex and difficult” due to the pandemic and frequent changes in travel advice rules. “We’ve been working hard to get the money back through the system and into our customer’s pockets as quickly as possible.” A CMA spokesperson said Lastminute.com must now report to the regulator how it is complying with the commitments it signed up to and the deadlines agreed: “Should it become clear that they have breached these undertakings we will consider further action.”"
2021-02-07T05:00:01Z,business,Business,Two tax credits in the Covid stimulus could save your business thousands | Gene Marks,"While a lot of attention has been given to the recent renewal of the paycheck protection program, there are two tax credits included in last December’s Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act that may actually be more valuable for many small businesses. Why?
Because the PPP is a forgivable loan that’s only available to certain businesses, whereas the employee retention tax credit and the work opportunity tax credit are both potential cash payments that are available to a greater number of small businesses. Interested? You should be. Because if your business is still in operation but has been at least partially affected by Covid, then you’re probably eligible. To be eligible for the employee retention tax credit in the first or second quarter of 2021 you must first show that your business had fewer than 500 full-time-equivalent employees and was either partially or fully shut down due to Covid restrictions. Even if you don’t match the shutdown requirements you can still qualify by demonstrating that your revenues (defined as total sales, net of returns and allowances) declined in either quarter by more than 20% compared with the same quarter in 2019 (employers that did not exist in 2019 can use the corresponding quarter in 2020 to measure the decline in their gross receipts). That threshold is lower than what is required to access PPP funds, which requires showing a 25% reduction in revenues. Assuming you qualify, you may be surprised at just how much money you’ll save. So here’s how you will figure that out. The first step will be to calculate the payroll taxes owed – like you usually do – for the quarter on your federal quarterly reporting form 941. You take 70% of each of your employees’ wages – whether they were working or furloughed and this includes health benefits – paid up to $10,000 that quarter. So the maximum credit for the first two quarters of 2021 is $7,000 per employee per quarter.
Now, go back to your form 941 and deduct – or credit – that amount against the Fica (the 6.2% social security tax) liability your company owes. Because this is a “refundable” tax credit if you owe less money than the amount of the credit you can get the money returned to you in cash. This is not a loan. There is no forgiveness. There’s no additional paperwork other than completing the federal form 941 which you, your payroll company or your accountant already does. Can you still claim the credit and participate in the paycheck protection program? Sure. As long as the wages you’re using in the credit calculation are separate from the wages you’re using to calculate the PPP loan and its forgiveness. In other words, no double dipping. The employee retention tax credit isn’t new. It began with the March 2020 Cares Act and employers can still go back and retroactively claim a credit for that year. But the bar to qualify is higher for 2020 and the amount of the credit is less. Thanks to the more recent stimulus bill, the requirements for the first two quarters have been loosened so it’s become easier and more lucrative. Pretty great, right? Well, that’s not all. There’s another lucrative tax credit that every small business owner should know about. It’s called the work opportunity tax credit. This is also a refundable credit and was extended through 2025. This credit is completely separate from the employee retention tax credit. That credit was for retaining employees. The work opportunity tax credit encourages you to hire employees. But not just any kind of employee. This credit is for small businesses who hire certain veterans, people off of welfare or out of prison and rehab and – most importantly – those that have been “long-term” unemployed. Long-term is defined as more than six months and we all know that this recession has created a lot of those kinds of workers. If you hire someone that fits those criteria then you can get a refundable credit of anywhere between $1,200 and $9,600 (yes, $9,600) against the income taxes you owe this year. This credit is per employee so the amount may be even higher if you bring on additional people that qualify. If an employee is included for the work opportunity tax credit, their wages are not allowed to also be included for purposes of calculating the employee retention tax credit. Again, no double dipping. Combined, both the employee retention and work opportunity tax credits can result in a big cash incentive for many small businesses, particularly for those that may not even qualify for another round of PPP. The only caveat I have is that calculating both credits isn’t easy or intuitive because, well, it’s the IRS, isn’t it? So you probably want to engage a professional accountant to help. But your returns for doing this should well exceed your costs – particularly the costs of leaving money on the table in a year when every dollar counts."
2021-02-07T00:05:55Z,business,Business,AstraZeneca set to weather Covid in better health than rivals,"Before the pandemic, AstraZeneca was highly regarded in the business and pharmaceutical world – seen as one of the UK’s best companies. Now, thanks to Britain’s successful vaccine programme, it is a household name. The Anglo-Swedish firm, which publishes annual results on Thursday, has sprung to prominence as maker of one of the world’s first Covid-19 vaccines, approved for use in the UK, EU and India. Inevitably, headlines have followed. AstraZeneca has been the focal point of the vaccine supply wars between the UK and the EU and has, as part of that row, faced questions over the effectiveness of the jab in the over-65s. Last week brought some respite when analysis of fresh data from three trials found that a single dose of its vaccine conferred an average 76% protection against Covid-19 for at least three months and cut transmission of the virus by 67%.
The last time AstraZeneca was in the news this much was in 2014, when it fended off an unwelcome £70bn takeover approach from US rival Pfizer, pricing its shares at £55. Six years later, in July 2020, AstraZeneca’s share price hit a record high of £93.20, after a successful transformation under chief executive Pascal Soriot. Picking the right research bets – in particular cancer drugs such as Tagrisso and Lynparza – has given AstraZeneca a strong oncology portfolio, while UK rival GSK is still trying to build one. AstraZeneca’s collaboration with Oxford University on the Covid-19 vaccine boosted its reputation and drove its share price higher. The drugmaker overtook Royal Dutch Shell and Unilever in May to become, for a couple of months, the biggest FTSE 100 company.
But unlike Pfizer, which expects to rake in $15bn (£11bn) in sales this year from its Covid-19 vaccine developed with Germany’s BioNTech, AstraZeneca says it will not make a profit from its vaccine and is providing it at cost price during this pandemic, at between $3 and $5 a dose. Any profits would come in future years, although the firm will face competition from other vaccines. Its antibody cocktail AZD7442 – which uses artificially generated antibodies to imitate the body’s natural immune response – is being tested as a preventative Covid treatment for those who cannot be vaccinated, and as a therapy for those ill with the virus. Other firms, including Eli Lilly, GSK and Regeneron, are also developing such antibody treatments, and though scientists have raised doubts over their effectiveness against the new Covid variants, this could become a competitive market. So, AstraZeneca’s main growth engine is its cancer drugs, such as Enhertu for breast, gastric and other cancers, developed with Japanese company Daiichi Sankyo, and Calquence, for the aggressive mantle cell lymphoma. Other potential blockbusters, with annual revenues of at least $1bn, include the asthma medicine Fasenra, which can spare patients the use of steroids. The company has had a good run lately: for example, its diabetes drug Farxiga has just been approved to treat heart failure in China and could become a mega-blockbuster, with Barclays forecasting peak sales of $3.8bn in 2025. The Cambridge firm has fared somewhat better in the pandemic than GSK, which it supplanted in 2019 as Britain’s biggest pharmaceutical company by market value, although its sales are below those of GSK. Analysts are expecting AstraZeneca to have made $26.4bn of revenues in 2020, compared with $24.4bn the previous year. It remains to be seen whether its recent $39bn acquisition of rare diseases specialist Alexion, its biggest-ever deal, will pay off. Analysts fear AstraZeneca may have paid too much but the company plans to take some of Alexion’s medicines into China, where it has opened five new regional headquarters in the past two years, and generates a fifth of its revenues. In any event, AstraZeneca is a lot stronger, and better known, than it was in 2014."
2021-02-07T00:01:56Z,business,Business,MPs to investigate LV= takeover bid amid fears members could lose out,"MPs are to investigate the £530m potential sale of the pensions and life insurance mutual LV= to the private equity firm Bain Capital amid fears that policyholders and members could lose out. The takeover of one of Britain’s biggest financial mutuals, founded in 1843 and trading for most of its life as Liverpool Victoria, has proved controversial as members and policyholders have yet to be given full details of any benefits they might receive or why Bain’s offer was selected over a number of others. Sources say the group’s board considered a similar bid from mutual Royal London and received offers from other mutuals, and yet opted to approve the offer from Bain, which is better known for investing in healthcare and education. The deal will require approval from 75% of members who vote but LV= wants to override a rule under which at least half of all members must approve demutualisation. An online meeting last week was attended by 220 of the group’s 1.1 million members, but the media were barred from attending. Gareth Thomas, the MP for Harrow West and chair of the all-party parliamentary group for mutuals, said: “Members of the parliamentary group are concerned at what impact the sale will have on LV= members, the insurance industry and competition and choice in financial services. We are also interested in whether the LV= decision reflects weaknesses in the government and regulators’ views and support of mutuals.” The group is inviting the LV= chairman, Alan Cook, and chief executive, Mark Hartigan, to give evidence, as well as mutual sector experts and financial analysts. MPs also want to hear from individuals and organisations with an interest in LV=. The deadline for the submission of written evidence is 5 March and oral evidence sessions will be heard over the next two months. The inquiry will consider whether LV=’s proposals are good for policyholders, for competition and for the business. It will also look at regulation of mutuals and friendly societies, including barriers to raising capital and protection from demutualisation. One source close to the parliamentary group said: “No demutualisation has resulted in increased long-term benefits for members beyond the initial payout while almost every executive team has ended up seeing their pay and benefits enhanced. You look at the past and wonder if that’s what is on the agenda this time.” Hartigan said: “We welcome the opportunity to more formally explain why Bain was singular in offering not only an excellent financial outcome for our members but also an unrivalled and long-term commitment to LV=’s future prospects, business and people.”
A spokesperson for LV said the mutual had sought a takeover bid because of restrictions on mutual insurance companies raising investment funds in the wider market. Announcing the deal in December, Alan Cook said it was the “culmination of an extremely thorough and robust strategic review.” • This article was amended on 8 February 2021 to clarify that the part of LV= to be sold to Bain is the pensions and life insurance business, not the general insurance business, which deals with products such as car, home and pet insurance"
2021-02-06T21:31:24Z,business,Business,"Philip Lowe is right. Raising jobseeker is not just about good economics, it's about fairness | Greg Jericho","This week fairness and economics were mentioned together by the head of the Reserve Bank, and not surprisingly it annoyed the government. Given the current base rate of jobseeker, they should be embarrassed, not annoyed. The case for raising the base rate of jobseeker is both obvious and already made – the government made it last year when it added the Covid bonus to the jobseeker payment. If the base rate of $576.50 a fortnight was enough there would have been no reason to raise it. The government raised it because the rate was not enough to act as an automatic stabiliser in a period of increased unemployment. And it also knew large numbers of those who would be newly unemployed would stop voting for the Coalition if they were forced to live on it.
And so it added a $250 bonus, which was later reduced to $150. In April the bonus will be removed and people will be back to getting by on $41 a day. Last year the Australian Council of Social Service found the rate was some 33% below the poverty line – down from about 5% below in the early 1990s.
Graph not displaying correctly? Click here In the early 90s, the dole was about 23% of average full-time earnings. Now it is down to 17%. Adding the bonus kept millions of out of poverty and also helped sustain the economy such that retail spending has surged even in the face of a deep recession. Even the Business Council of Australia supports a call for the rate to be raised. So it was no shock that this week when the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, told the National Press Club: “There is a wide consensus in the community that the previous level should be increased permanently and I’ve said on previous occasions that I would join that consensus.” And yet that answer was enough for government backbencher Tim Wilson, who chairs the House economic committee, to say on ABC24 later that afternoon that he thought Lowe had “exceeded his mandate in offering this view” and that the governor “probably should have kept his opinion to himself”. Given that it is the RBA’s duty “to contribute to the stability of the currency, full employment, and the economic prosperity and welfare of the Australian people” it is a fair stretch to say he was speaking beyond his remit. But it was even more weird that Wilson would suggest such a thing when all the governor did was reiterate what he has said previously. In fact he said it just six months ago at a hearing of the House economic committee of which Wilson is the chair. In August Lowe told the committee: “There is, I think, a fairly broad consensus across society that some increase in the level of the old Newstart is appropriate. I would join that consensus.” I note that at the time Wilson did not suggest Lowe was speaking out of turn. Perhaps he wasn’t paying attention? Or perhaps the aspect that got under Wilson’s skin so much this week was that the governor also said the issue was really not about economics but fairness. He told the gathering that for him it was “not a macroeconomic management issue, it is a fairness issue, and what is the appropriate level of support we should provide to people who are unemployed”. The economic aspect was not, he said, “the first order issue”. Rather it was a question of “as a society what level of support we want to provide to people who don’t have a job”. In 2000 Newstart was 20% of average full-time earnings. If jobseeker was raised to that level it would be about $715 a fortnight – the rate it currently is when including the Covid bonus payment. Raising the rate is not radical, nor would it create an unprecedented situation. All it would do is answer Lowe’s question by realising that right now fairness is utterly lacking in the government’s approach to economic policy, and that needs to change."
2021-02-06T16:00:46Z,business,Business,US billionaires vie to make space the next business frontier,"Later this year Jeff Bezos, the first person to have led a business from nothing to a trillion-dollar valuation, will step down from his job as head of Amazon. But as you’d expect from a tech multibillionaire, his eyes are on a potentially bigger prize: outer space. Bezos will be dedicating more time to a space race between entrepreneur rivals that hopes to push the frontiers of society – and commerce – beyond planet Earth. Having completed its 14th mission last month – successfully carrying a dummy, “Mannequin Skywalker”, into space – Bezos’s space company, Blue Origin, believes relatively cheap travel for humans is not far off. That would finally deliver a return on the $1bn (£730m) of Amazon stock Bezos has to sell annually to fund it. Blue Origin was one of four projects flagged by the Amazon boss as likely recipients of his attention now, alongside the Washington Post newspaper, his Day One charitable fund and the environmental Earth Fund. “I’ve never had more energy, and this isn’t about retiring. I’m super passionate about the impact I think these organisations can have,” said Bezos, who is becoming executive chairman at Amazon. But competition in the stratosphere will be as tough as in retail. Rival billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX is arguably ahead of Blue Origin. Despite an uncrewed test flight last week ending in a fiery crash, SpaceX is already able to reuse its Falcon 9 rockets. Musk (no stranger to making and sometimes breaking bold promises) aims to fly to Mars as soon as 2024.
There had already been a private-sector revolution in the space industry, as US government enthusiasm for huge spending waned. Commercial companies now account for about 80% of the $424bn global space industry, according to Professor Loizos Heracleous of Warwick Business School, who has written extensively on the business of space. Most of the industry is focused on IT, but experts believe the billionaires’ efforts are about to usher in a new era, with the start of space tourism, manufacturing and more. Google co-founder Larry Page has backed Planetary Resources, a startup hoping to mine asteroids. It will be overdue in the eyes of many. Sir Richard Branson predicted that Virgin Galactic, the space tourism company he founded, would first fly in space in 2009. Nonetheless, despite false starts and a fatal crash in 2014, analysts at UBS say Virgin Galactic will in 2021 offer “the only way for consumers to gain entry into the [roughly] 560-member astronaut club in the next five years”. Cheaper technology – such as “cubesats” the size of a loaf of bread – mean more players can turn their eyes skywards. A global wave of investors looking for returns has loosed a wave of easy money, much of it through special purpose acquisition companies (Spacs) – “blank-cheque” vehicles that raise money on stock exchanges before boldly going to look for investments.
Spacs have made some investors nervous about too-easy money, but they are delivering funding. Astra, a California-based rocket company founded by a former Nasa chief technology officer, last week announced it would use a merger with a Spac to list on the Nasdaq exchange, with a valuation of $2.1bn. Momentus, a company aiming for “last-mile” transportation in space, announced last October that it, too, would take the Spac route, for a billion-dollar valuation. The total space industry could grow by $1tn in the next decade, according to Ron Epstein, aerospace analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He sees a turning point as technology improvements and capital combine, making space tourism and in-space manufacturing – of space stations, or even pharmaceuticals – increasingly viable. Deep-pocketed investors were playing a role similar to that of predecessors who had helped aerospace grow into a global industry, he said.
Heracleous agreed: “Accidents for SpaceX and other commercial players show that space-faring is unpredictable and dangerous. But this is the price for solving challenges and pushing the frontiers of technology and, ultimately, humanity.” However, it is still an inherently risky business. Alok Sharma, the then business secretary, last year had to override written warnings from his top civil servant that the UK government could lose everything when it invested £400m in OneWeb, a bankrupt but potentially promising satellite company. Governments are still involved. A mission to land the first woman on the moon by 2024 appears to be one of Donald Trump’s few legacies. Joe Biden’s administration said last week that it would continue the programme. SpaceX and Blue Origin are already working on moon-lander designs under contracts awarded last year by Nasa for almost $1bn, alongside Dynetics, a subsidiary of defence contractor Leidos. Those contracts covered only 10 months of work: Nasa is due to evaluate each company’s efforts this month, before a test mission with just one of them. Taking people to the moon and beyond is a key part of both Musk’s and Bezos’s visions, which can verge on the apocalyptic. Bezos talked in 2019 of a trillion humans populating the solar system, far beyond the resources of Earth; Musk has made clear his belief that a Mars colony could save humanity. That view is heavily criticised by some environmentalists, who argue we should focus on respecting the bounds of the planet we already inhabit. Yet the hope for the space industry is that, by lowering the cost of space access, this billionaire race may have as-yet-unknown benefits for the world, even as the existential threat from the climate crisis looms. Jim Cantrell, who worked with Musk at SpaceX in its early days, sourcing rockets, said the company’s success had made it easier for other space projects to get off the ground. These include his latest company, Phantom Space, which aims to drive down launch costs by mass-producing small rockets. Cantrell said cheaper access to space had started something like the “New World economy” that followed the discovery of America: “It’s just beyond imagination how big it is.”
Space cadets Jeff Bezos Blue Origin will be one of Bezos’s priorities in life beyond Amazon, alongside the Washington Post newspaper and his charities. Sir Richard Branson Virgin Galactic could have paying passengers in space this year. An early focus on space tourism could eventually give way to supersonic travel using similar technology. Elon Musk Musk’s shareholding in Tesla meant he overtook Bezos as the world’s richest man this year. His schedule also includes Neuralink, a brain-to-computer interface, alongside SpaceX’s Mars ambitions. Larry Page The Google co-founder has backed Planetary Resources, an asteroid mining company, although analysts believe successful resource extraction could be decades away. Marc Benioff The Salesforce founder was a backer of Astra, a rocket startup that will raise as much as $500m through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. Mark Zuckerberg The Facebook founder has expressed ambivalence about space tourism, but he did back Breakthrough Starshot, a project to send out small laser-powered “lightsail” spacecraft to collect imagery and scientific data."
2021-02-06T12:00:40Z,business,Business,Will Ikea’s recycling scheme really make it greener?,"If spending more time at home has made you consider a furniture update, do not sling out that Billy bookcase just yet. Instead of taking it to the tip, you may be able to raise some cash through Ikea’s new buyback service. The scheme, which it announced last autumn, allows customers to take their furniture back to the store to be refunded and receive a voucher worth up to half of the item’s original value. It will then be resold to a new home, giving it “a second chance at life”. The furniture retailer says the service will reduce waste and increase sustainability, and is part of its efforts to go greener. Last week it told the FT it was also looking at offering a wider range of spare parts to help people repair its products. But does it need to do more to improve its green image? It has long come under fire for its environmental impact, consuming vast amounts of resources to mass-produce furniture that is not known for its durability. Will other businesses take the lead? Ikea’s success has been built on two factors: design and price. “Before Ikea came about, people used to inherit furniture or they would have to buy something really expensive,” says David Grimshaw, a programme leader in postgraduate product design at the Manchester School of Art. “Young people didn’t want houses that looked like their parents’, with highly decorative furniture, but they also didn’t have a huge amount of money.” Grimshaw says brands such as Habitat and Heal’s took on a more contemporary, functional design, but they had high prices. “Ikea came in with an affordability that really made it stand out,” he says. “Ikea allowed you to say: ‘We’re not going to live like our parents.’” The minimal designs Ikea offered were not purely cooked up for style. To drive down the price, the company had to mass-produce its products, so needed to maximise the audience it could sell them to. The minimal design provided the answer, making its products suitable for a wide range of homes.
The flatpack model reduced production costs, and so, too, did the huge out-of-town stores. Consumers paid for their own transport and construction costs, enabling Ikea to undercut its competitors on price. But low prices can lead to a feeling that an item is disposable and we can move on from it without too much thought. Lucie Middlemiss, a co-director of the Sustainability Research Institute at the University of Leeds, says: “We’re unlikely to be wearing the same clothes in 10 years, or driving the same car. There’s a faster turnover of stuff, and that’s where we have a problem.” Middlemiss says that while Ikea’s buyback initiative is a step in the right direction, it risks “ending up being a tokenistic gesture”. A greater environmental impact, she says, would come if the retailer offered repairs, veneers to update the appearances of tired furniture or, as it is considering, small parts for fixes. “I think there is a role for businesses to take the lead,” she says. “Because they don’t have much competition, Ikea might have the flexibility to raise prices a little bit to green its processes in some way. Often the green option is unaffordable, so it would be great if Ikea could crack it at a reasonably low price point.” For businesses, there is a potential downside to producing more durable products, says Dr Francesco Nava, a professor of economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science. “With more durable products, it becomes tricky to sustain profit margins because, in the end, everyone has the products.” He says Ikea offers good quality for the prices it charges and is unlikely to be toppled soon by a firm with a more sustainable approach. “It’s hard to have a green furniture process at a smaller price bracket for consumers, so, at the moment, I don’t see big global players in the furniture market that could buy customers away,” he says.
‘A cheap product I can leave behind’ One of those customers is Alexa Downie Ngini, a 22-year-old auditor living in London in rental accommodation. For her, the attraction of Ikea is its price and convenience. “I’m renting and moving flats every year,” she says. “For me, what I need is a cheap product that I can buy that I don’t care about leaving behind when I move. I don’t mind moving smaller items, like mirrors, with me when I go but not something large like a desk. I don’t have a car, nor do many people renting in London.” The lack of transport also turns Ngini off secondhand products, which often require collection. “When I shop at Ikea, we go and do it all in a day. If I get secondhand stuff, I have to drive all around London getting it,” she says. “It is so inconvenient for me to try to buy more expensive items, or secondhand items, and then transport them, that I’d take the environmental cost.” While secondhand might remain in second place for now, Grimshaw suggests that local initiatives could provide the best competition for the furniture retailer. With a rise in the popularity of digital cutting machines, furniture plans can be found online and built by local manufacturers using local materials. The machines are more adaptable than those found in mass production, meaning that furniture can be made bespoke – offering an alternative to “ubiquitous” Ikea. “Here, you’re transporting data around the world, not raw materials, which drops the level of emissions,” he says. “I think that could be a threat to Ikea.” ‘Climate positive by 2030’ Hege Sæbjørnsen, the country sustainability manager of Ikea UK and Ireland, says it is “committed to becoming fully circular and climate positive by 2030”, with all products being made from renewable, recyclable or recycled materials.
“They will be designed to be reused, refurbished, remanufactured or recycled,” she says. “We’ve signed up to science-based targets, with goals that span over our entire value chain – from the extraction and processing of raw materials, to our zero-waste-to-landfill policy, from the stores and touchpoints where we meet our customers, to the use and end-of life of our products.” According to Sæbjørnsen, 97% of the firm’s wood came from “more sustainable sources” last year, and it uses a recovery department, which repacks returned products to avoid them going to waste, and offers spare parts to enable customers to fix existing products. “Low price does not mean low quality or unsustainable products, just as high price does not mean high quality and sustainable products. We strongly believe that sustainability cannot be a luxury for the few,” she says. Beyond Billy bookcase
According to Ikea, one Billy bookcase is sold every five seconds – probably because buyers can bag one for £35. But what more sustainable options are out there? For a model of the same dimensions at Unto This Last, an independent furniture maker that uses a digital cutting machine to produce its own flatpack furniture, buyers would face a £190 bill. Etsy boasts an array of independent sellers, with bookshelves made from recycled materials generally costing between £100 and £200. Buying secondhand has long been a solution to the sustainability question. With the rise of Facebook Marketplace and local “free stuff” groups, this is only getting easier. Or you can use charity shops – Oxfam and the British Heart Foundation are among those running standalone furniture outlets. There has also been a rise in the popularity of upgrading and personalising Ikea products. IKEAhackers.net offers suggestions for modifying your old Ikea furniture from upcycling fans around the world – from updating tired products to repurposing the parts to use for something new. How the buyback scheme works Ikea’s buyback scheme was due to launch in November but has been put on hold because of the Covid-19 restrictions. It is expected to launch sometime this year. If you return a white Billy bookcase that cost £35 to buy and now has minor scratches, you will get about £14 back, or £17 if the product is as good as new. The oak-effect Kallax shelving unit, £55 new, will fetch you £16 if it is well used, or £27 if you return it in good condition. You can find an estimated price for your product online but the final amount will be decided by an Ikea employee when you bring your it into the store. If you decide to go ahead with the scheme, Ikea will take back your assembled item and resell it at a reduced price, and you will get the value on a gift card."
2021-02-06T08:00:35Z,business,Business,Is big tech now just too big to stomach?,"The coronavirus pandemic has wrought economic disruption on a global scale, but one sector has marched on throughout the chaos: big tech. Further evidence of the industry’s relentless progress has come in recent weeks with the news that Apple and Amazon both raked in sales of $100bn (£72bn) over the past three months – 25% more than Tesco brings in over a full year. Amazon also revealed that its founder, Jeff Bezos, is to step down as chief executive. It was a big moment for the company founded in Seattle 26 years ago. But the shares barely stuttered, and few expect the company to, either. The relentless rise of the big six tech firms - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google owner Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft, now known as the Fangam stocks – powered US markets last year. The S&P index – the barometer of corporate America – ended the year up more than 18%, an extraordinary outcome given the market crash of March. But two-thirds of that gain was entirely down to the increases in value registered by the six Fangam stocks. The gains are eye-watering. Amazon’s share price is up 62% over the past year, valuing the business at $1.7tn, $650m more than a year ago. Apple stock is up 70% over the same period, an increase which has taken its valuation up by more than $1tn, to $2.3tn. Results published so far in 2021 show no sign that the gains will let up. Apple in January reported its most profitable quarter ever, and Facebook also said the pandemic had helped it grow. Amazon recorded sales of more than $100bn for the first time in the last quarter of 2020 – allowing Bezos to sound a positive note as he changed roles to focus on his ambitions in space, his Earth Fund and his ownership of the Washington Post – and Alphabet posted record revenues for the second successive quarter. The eye-catching performance of big tech has prompted increased political scrutiny and the threat of heightened regulation from Washington, especially now that the Democrats have won control of the Senate. There is now a real possibility that President Biden will take on tech companies over issues such as privacy, liability and market dominance. And such is the collective scale of the US tech titans, it will be difficult for them to hide. How big is big tech? Apple became the world’s first trillion-dollar company in August 2018 (barring a few state-owned oil companies whose true valuations remain murky). Just over two years later – in the midst of the pandemic in August 2020 – Apple notched up the $2tn (£1.5tn) milestone.
The extraordinary size of these companies can be difficult to comprehend. Alphabet’s $162bn of revenues outweighed the size of Hungary’s economy in 2019. Apple’s $67bn earnings before tax from its last financial year would pay for the UK government’s combined spending on defence and transport. Amazon’s army of workers worldwide now numbers 1.2 million and it is rated the third biggest employer in the world, after Walmart and the China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation. A late (and perhaps debatable) entrant to the big tech ranks is Tesla. Investors appear to be valuing the US electric car manufacturer more like a tech platform, in the hope it will use its brand and nascent autonomous driving software to dominate transportation in the future. That logic has propelled it into the ranks of the world’s most valuable companies (and has recently made its chief executive, Elon Musk, the world’s richest man). Its shares have rocketed from $86 at the start of 2020 to $845 now, with some investors fearing it is in the throes of an investment bubble.
So, how did big tech get so big? One common complaint about the stock market is that it is disconnected from economic reality, with booming growth in share prices even as economies suffer historic recessions. The flip side is the argument that these companies are more connected to our new reality than ever before: in fact, between them the big tech companies are involved in a huge proportion of human interactions with digital tech every day, from mobile phones for locked down families to the computers used in businesses all over the world. The electric car technology pioneered by Tesla will play a key role in fighting the climate crisis – and investors have belatedly got on board. But big tech’s fate has become disconnected from the rest of the corporate world. As Jeremy Grantham, a high-profile investor, pointed out last month, Tesla’s stock market value is equal to about $1.25m for every car it sells over a year. At rival carmaker General Motors, the company is valued at $9,000 per car. Tech’s rise has meant the concentration of market value in the five biggest companies has returned to levels last seen in the early 1970s. Back then the stock market was dominated by the old industrial economy: photographic film company Eastman Kodak, ExxonMobil predecessor Standard Oil, and General Motors were in the top five, along with IBM and AT&T. Big tech has completely displaced older industries in the top five.
Who benefits from the share price surge? The rise of big tech has created the biggest personal fortunes ever seen, and a new class of hyper-rich: the centibillionaires. Almost all of that wealth comes from shares retained by founders of the business. During the pandemic that wealth has increased at a phenomenal rate: in 2020 both Bezos and Musk gained more than $100bn apiece – or about $3,000 per second.
But there are other beneficiaries. Among the biggest shareholders in all of them are Wall Street and City investment companies such as BlackRock, Vanguard and Legal & General. While those asset managers earn juicy fees by charging clients such as pension funds a percentage of stock market gains from the growth of big tech, their growth also benefits the ultimate owners – including the pension funds providing for hundreds of millions of people saving for retirement. UK fund manager Baillie Gifford’s investments in Tesla have made an extraordinary $29bn (£21bn) for investors including pension funds, foundations and charities, according to figures released to the Guardian. Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, which is managed by Baillie Gifford, began buying Tesla heavily in 2013 when the shares were changing hands at about $6 each, compared with today’s $840. That soaring share price led Scottish Mortgage to be admitted into the FTSE 100 index of the UK’s biggest listed companies in 2017 and last year the price rise made Scottish Mortgage the best-performing company in the FTSE 100. Why is size a problem? With size comes power. A simple change in an algorithm can wipe out smaller companies reliant on tech companies’ platforms or even nascent industries. Changes to Facebook’s algorithm in 2018 hit some viral publishers’ revenues hard, while the complexities of negotiating Amazon’s search rankings have spawned an advisory industry. And the companies have also sought increasingly to influence politics. Google overtook Goldman Sachs as the biggest spender on political donations for the first time in 2014. The six tech companies’ total spend on lobbying in the US had risen to $64m in 2019, according to the US Center for Responsive Politics. While that amount is tiny compared with the companies’ profits, its rapid rise represents big tech’s increasing attempts to influence policy directly.
Big tech’s increasing size gives it another big advantage: the bigger it becomes, the harder it is to challenge. This has always been a problem with dominant companies, who are able to use their scale to win better deals and lower prices. But with the tech platforms such as social networks or Amazon’s retail network, the more users they have, the faster their value grows. It is what economists call the network effect. Where could big tech fall foul of regulators? Some of the big tech companies have been able to avoid any major competition enquiries in part because they offer consumers cheaper services than ever before. However, there is increasing scrutiny of monopolistic practices. One area of focus has been their willingness to pay what seemed like very high prices for fast-growing competitors. Emails unearthed by US Congress showed that Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook should buy Instagram in part to neutralise its threat. Facebook has – contravening previous pledges – started to slowly combine Instagram’s messaging technology with its other social network, Whatsapp. Google faces intense antitrust scrutiny in the US over its dominance of internet search, which the EU in 2017 found it had abused by boosting results for its own services. Apple is facing a growing backlash by companies trying to sell services to iPhone users. Epic Games, the maker of the wildly popular Fortnite franchise, and music streaming platform Spotify have both launched legal complaints against Apple’s insistence that it takes a 30% cut of all sales made through the app store – including music streaming subscriptions that Spotify and many other third-party app developers have long complained is an unfair “tax”. And tax? How much do they pay? One controversy is common to all of the US tech companies (although by no means confined to them): tax avoidance techniques that critics see as aggressive and unfair to smaller competitors. All of the big tech companies use subsidiaries in low-tax countries such as Luxembourg, Bermuda and Ireland to sell services to end markets such as the UK. Fair Tax Mark, a non-governmental organisation, last year singled out Amazon in particular for its opaque tax structures and low amounts of tax paid relative to profits. Globally, Fair Tax Mark calculated, the six big tech companies had paid $100bn less cash in taxes over a decade than they had provided for in their accounts, primarily by shifting profits to tax havens and using creative accounting techniques that are legal, but are usually unavailable to smaller companies. The companies paid $155bn less than might be expected under headline tax rates – money that could have been used to fund public services and infrastructure around the world.
Complex legal structures make it impossible to work out precisely how much profit the big tech companies shift out of individual countries, but Tax Watch UK, a campaign group, estimated that Google, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft, as well as network tech company Cisco, avoided £5bn in UK corporation tax between 2012 and 2017. None of the companies have confirmed such data, although all have said their tax structures follow the law.
Can they be forced to pay more? World leaders are acutely aware of tax issues in particular, and there has been some progress on moving towards a global tax regime to reduce profit shifting from country to country. The US government has up until now looked askance at efforts coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to allow other countries to tax American tech champions more. However, a Biden administration may make a limited deal more likely. Individual countries have tried to target big tech, including the UK with its digital services tax. But Amazon’s revelation that it will not itself pay the levy – but will pass it on to other sellers which use its platform – shows how difficult it is for one country to strike out on its own.
Could big tech be broken up? The most likely challenges to the big tech companies are likely to come from policymakers in their two biggest markets: the US and the EU. The EU has won some notable victories against the tech companies, but has also some painful defeats – such as a court ruling last year that Apple did not have to pay a €13bn (£11.4bn) Irish tax bill. More onerous regulations in the second biggest market could be costly for tech companies. In the US, businesses have been forcibly broken up in the past. Most famously, in 1911, the Sherman Act of 1890 was used to force Standard Oil to split into 34 separate companies. It was used again to force the breakup of the AT&T telephone company in 1984 and against Microsoft in 1998, though an order to split that company into two was later overturned on appeal. More recently in the US Congress a committee report found big tech has “too much power”, and Google and Facebook face significant if limited antitrust actions by US regulators and prosecutors. In October last year, the US Department of Justice filed an antitrust case against Google and said it was “again enforcing the Sherman Act to restore the role of competition”. However, these complex cases could last years, and it is likely that the authorities would settle for remedies short of a complete breakup. There is growing consensus on both sides of the bitter political divide that some of the big tech companies need more oversight, although finding consensus on solutions will be much more difficult. Kamala Harris, then a US senator, said in 2019 that there needed to be more regulation. Whether that attitude is picked up by Joe Biden’s White House now Harris is the vice-president is the biggest question facing big tech over the next four years.

2021-02-05T17:50:44Z,business,Business,Was GameStop really a case of the little guys beating Wall Street? Maybe not,"The Reddit rebellion against Wall Street – a battle that appeared to pitch small investors against the financial titans – may not have been quite what it seemed, according to an analysis by JP Morgan.
After shares of the ailing video games retailer GameStop hit record highs last month, small investors who had piled into the stock claimed victory over hedge funds that had bet the price would collapse. But JP Morgan researchers found GameStop’s shares were not even in the top 10 of most traded stocks by small investors, and suggested institutional investors rather than an army of meme-toting Redditors may have been behind the dramatic rise in the share price. “Although retail buying was portrayed as the main driver of the extreme price rally experienced by some stocks, the actual picture may be much more nuanced,” JP Morgan global quantitative and derivatives strategy analyst Peng Cheng told clients in a note. The analysis of public data from exchanges found GameStop was No 15 on the firm’s retail buying list for January. Other companies that benefited from a Reddit bounce, including the cinema chain AMC, were popular buys for small investors. But GameStop’s absence will complicate the picture as US authorities investigate exactly what happened. “Maybe it’s not as much of just the little guy versus the big guy,” JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan told CNBC. “I think that it’s reasonable to say that institutional investors were also very active in those stocks last week because there are institutional investors that participate in names that have elevated volume. I think most likely that was also expressed in some of the options activity last week as well.”"
2021-02-05T16:54:29Z,business,Business,Queen's property manager banks huge windfarm bonanza,"The Queen and the Treasury are in line for a multibillion-pound bonanza from renewable energy, after a major auction of seabed plots for windfarms off the coasts of England and Wales attracted runaway bids. The crown estate, which manages the monarch’s property portfolio, holds exclusive rights to lease the seabed around the British Isles. With its first auction of windfarm licences in a decade understood to have reached record highs, the Queen’s income is expected to leap by at least £100m a year, while the takings will generate over £300m a year for the Treasury. Two windfarm sites within the Irish Sea have reportedly attracted the most frenzied bidding, with energy firms offering to pay as much as £200m for each – a total revenue of £400m a year. Awards for another three areas have yet to be decided. The licences are for 10 years, meaning the auction will raise at least £4bn over a decade.
The vast sums involved have prompted calls for the revenues from Britain’s renewable resources to be kept by the public in a “green sovereign wealth fund” that could be used to invest in tackling the climate crisis. “Rather than being squirrelled away in Treasury coffers, how much better would it be to use this renewable windfall as initial capital for a sovereign wealth fund that could then be invested for future generations, similar to what we’ve seen the likes of Alaska and Norway do in the past with their oil wealth,” said the Green party co-leader, Jonathan Bartley. The crown estate declined to comment on the confidential process which requires all participants to sign ironclad non-disclosure contracts to prevent leaking commercially sensitive details about the process before it has concluded.
The identity of the winning bidder is not known, but market sources told the industry journal ReNews that it was likely to be a large oil producer. Companies including BP, Shell and Norwegian oil producer Equinor have all taken an interest in offshore wind as oil revenues decline and pressure rises to pursue green energy portfolios. The crown estate’s profits from the multibillion-pound windfall would more than double the property manager’s £345m earnings in the last financial year. The money is handed to the Treasury before 25% is returned to the royal household in the form of the sovereign grant. The sovereign grant was increased in 2017, from its previous level of 15%, to pay for extensive renovations at Buckingham Palace. It will stay at 25% at least until the next five-year review in 2021-2022, meaning the royal household should benefit directly from the money raised from the new windfarm leases. The crown estate was given the renewable energy exploitation rights to the seabeds around Britain in 2004, under an Energy Act passed while Tony Blair was prime minister. MPs voting through the legislation at the time are unlikely to have predicted the sea change in energy provision now leading forecasters to predict wind will become the dominant energy source in the UK. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has set a target for every home in the UK to be powered by offshore wind by 2030.
An industry journal reported this week that windfarm developers were left dismayed at the runaway auction which will lead to “bonkers” revenues for the Queen’s property manager. The initial auction rounds held earlier this week revealed a winning bid of around £150,000 per megawatt a year for two separate 1.5GW windfarms in the Irish Sea, according to ReNews, or five times higher than the top bids expected in the early rounds. The winners of the Irish Sea sites will be required to pay the crown estate about £200m a year in “rent” for each licence area, while building the offshore windfarm, or a total of £2bn for each windfarm site over the 10 years it usually takes to develop these projects. In total, the auction will award leases from 7GW worth of offshore wind power capacity in areas around the English and Welsh coastlines, with the potential to deliver clean electricity for more than 6m homes.
Traditional renewable energy developers are understood to be unhappy about the aggressive auction bids, claiming that the process risks distorting the UK’s green energy market by inflating costs which could ultimately be shouldered by energy billpayers. The crown estate was forced to overhaul its proposed auction process in 2019 after the industry warned that calling for “closed envelope” bids would lead to excessive prices. Instead, it promised to use daily bidding cycles to make the process more transparent. However, the first round of the auction was still “closed”, leading to an aggressive start. The auction is ongoing, and the results will be confirmed only once it has closed."
2021-02-05T16:05:21Z,business,Business,"UK  consumers likely to hold off spending on socialising, senior Bank official predicts","Concerns about mutant strains of Covid-19 could depress some types of consumer spending after lockdown eases, one of the Bank of England’s most senior officials has said. Ben Broadbent, deputy governor for monetary policy, said lingering fears about coronavirus variants could deter people from making some spending decisions later this year after restrictions have been relaxed. He told CNBC that sectors of the economy where people interacted socially could face weaker levels of demand for goods and services. “One hopes that we now have pretty good data on infection rates including identification of any new variants, but those fears could well linger,” he said. “I can certainly see why people might be fearful to spend on particular things, things that expose them to the risk of infection. And as you say, some of those fears may linger even after vaccination.” Despite his note of caution, Broadbent said he anticipated a strong recovery in consumer spending this summer as Covid restrictions were eased, helping the UK recover economically from the pandemic.
Highlighting a boom in activity after the relaxation of lockdown last summer, he said: “Overall spending does come back pretty strongly when you remove these caps, at least initially. So we have certainly allowed for some lingering concerns. But that doesn’t mean that consumption overall won’t recover quite strongly, at least initially, once you start loosening the restrictions. That was exactly the experience we had last year.” Hospitality, leisure and international travel, where social interaction is important, have suffered most in the pandemic. However, Broadbent said consumers had reallocated spending to areas where the risks of infection were lower, helping to offset the damage to the economy at large. Online sales, as well as spending on DIY, home furnishings, bicycles and hobbies have surged during the past year. Threadneedle Street is forecasting a 4.25% plunge in GDP in the first quarter, followed by a resurgence of economic activity as vaccinations allow the economy to return to brisk growth. The Bank said on Thursday that it expected high street lenders to prepare for potential negative rates by July, in case there was a fresh downturn and it needed to cut the official rate below zero to stimulate the economy.
Officials said the balance of risks in the economy, mainly from new variants of Covid overwhelming the vaccination programme, meant it needed to keep rates low at 0.1%. Broadbent said tight border restrictions imposed by the government could drag down economic activity in the coming weeks. Ministers are preparing to quarantine arrivals to the UK from high-risk countries in hotels from 15 February, because of concerns about mutant strains of Covid-19. The Bank has not forecast the implications of specific border controls, but Broadbent said: “My instinct would be that if you close borders, that would be negative for both the demand and the supply side of the economy.”"
2021-02-05T15:47:45Z,business,Business,French Connection receives two takeover approaches as shares surge,"The ailing clothing retailer French Connection has received two separate takeover approaches from potential suitors. The company, which unsuccessfully sought to find a buyer in 2019, said it had been approached by the retail investor Spotlight Brands, with backing from the restructuring and investment firm Gordon Brothers. Spotlight has backed British brands including fitness-focused Sweaty Betty, while Gordon Brothers acquired the Laura Ashley brand last year following its administration. The second approach has come from the brand investment platform Go Global Retail, in conjunction with HMJ International Services. “Discussions with both Spotlight and Go Global remain at a very early stage,” said French Connection in a statement to investors. “Accordingly, there can be no certainty that an offer will be made, nor as to the terms on which any offer might be made. Further announcements will be made as appropriate in due course.” However, French Connection noted that any offer for its business was likely to be made in cash. The suitors have until 5 March to make a formal offer.
News of the potential offers sent shares in French Connection 65% higher by late afternoon trading on Friday, to 25.8p, giving the retailer a market value of £25m. Last year, French Connection warned that it could run out of cash unless sales improved or it received a cash injection. The retailer, which was founded by Stephen Marks in 1972 and also owns the Great Plains brand, owns 68 stores and concessions in the UK as well as many overseas outlets. It employs about 780 staff. The company recorded a £7.3m pre-tax loss in its last annual results. The takeover approaches come more than a year after French Connection called off plans to find a buyer following a year-long search. A sale would provide an exit for Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group retail business, which owns an almost-25% stake in French Connection."

2021-02-05T13:56:16Z,business,Business,Robinhood lifts all trading restrictions including Gamestop and AMC shares,"Robinhood, the financial trading platform credited with enabling and then inhibiting the unprecedented rise of Gamestop stocks, lifted all trading restrictions on Friday, allowing users to buy shares in Reddit-promoted companies after a week of financial tumult.
The company has been criticized by users after it limited the number of Gamestop and AMC shares individuals could purchase following a Reddit-led spike in certain companies’ share prices. “There are currently no temporary limits to increasing your positions,” Robinhood said in a statement on its website. Robinhood had only allowed users to trade 500 shares in GameStop, a video-game store chain, and 5,500 AMC shares, according to Reuters, after an initial surge in mid-January. The lifting of restrictions came as the US treasury department reportedly began to explore how to prevent a similar set of events from happening again. Robinhood had been accused of protecting hedge funds, some of whom pay the company to execute its users’ trades, when it introduced restrictions on purchases. Thousands of small traders had used Robinhood – which positioned itself as a user-friendly platform for inexperienced investors – to purchase Gamestop, AMC, BlackBerry and other companies after the WallStreetBets sub-Reddit inspired a mass trading event. Politicians as ideologically diverse as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ted Cruz have criticized Robinhood, with Ocasio-Cortez suggesting a congressional hearing into the company. But Robinhood said the restrictions were necessary for it to cover potential losses. “With individual volatile securities accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars in deposit requirements … we had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile securities to ensure we could comfortably meet our requirements,” a statement on Robinhood’s website said. On Friday, Axios reported that treasury secretary Janet Yellen had convened regulators in the wake of the Gamestop surge, to discuss preventing the boom and bust events of the past two weeks. The government is exploring a crackdown on market manipulation and a tax on financial transactions, Axios said."
2021-02-05T13:32:41Z,business,Business,"US economy adds 49,000 jobs as Biden aims for further Covid relief","The US economy added back 49,000 jobs last month as coronavirus restrictions eased and fiscal stimulus from Washington goosed up the economy, the labor department announced on Friday. The unemployment rate dropped to 6.3%, down significantly from its pandemic high of 14.7% in April. While January’s figure marked a return to growth after job losses in December, the number was weak and big problems remain.
On Thursday, the labor department said 779,000 people filed new unemployment claims last week, down from the week before but still close to four times pre-pandemic levels. The latest figures showed some 17.8 million Americans are still claiming unemployment benefits. In December the US lost 140,000 jobs as the latest wave of Covid-19 infections led to more shutdowns across the country and a slowdown in economic activity. That figure was revised to a loss of 227,000 jobs on Friday. Professional and business services (up 97,000 jobs) and local government (up 49,000) saw the largest gains over the month. The US is still losing huge numbers of jobs in leisure and hospitality (down 61,000) and retail (down 38,000) and the stark gap in racial unemployment rates remains. The unemployment rate for white Americans was 6% while for Black Americans it was 9.2% and for Latinos it was 8.6%. The jobs figure come as the Biden administration is trying to push through a $1.9tn stimulus package which would send $1,400 cheques to many Americans and provide fresh aid for struggling businesses. It would also increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 – the first increase since 2009. The plan has widespread support from voters, with a Quinnipiac survey showing more than two-thirds of respondents in favor of the plan. But it has met with opposition from Republicans in Congress, who have balked at the size of the stimulus and proposed a far smaller package. Biden’s plan was approved in the Senate early Friday by a 51 to 50 vote, with the vice-president casting the tie-breaking vote, but still faces hurdles and is not expected to become law before mid March. The recovery in the jobs market may embolden opponents but some economists warned that the economic toll of the virus is far from over. Jason Reed, assistant chair of finance at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business, said: “We shouldn’t forget that the economy is still down about 10m jobs since the start of the pandemic. We aren’t anywhere close to where we were this time last year. “The rollout of the vaccine will surely help Americans get back to work, but we shouldn’t expect a return to normal until late 2021 or early 2022.”"
2021-02-05T10:19:14Z,business,Business,UK's green plan offers mixed hopes for post-Covid-19 jobs boom,"Britain’s homes are going green, says Derek Horrocks, who runs a home insulation business in Lancashire that has vacancies for architects, surveyors, administrators and accountants.
Horrocks, who runs Sustainable Building Services from his offices in Skelmersdale, near Wigan, south Lancashire, says he spent much of 2020 contemplating how to avoid making redundancies. That was after several years when ministers said they wanted to turbo-charge the insulation of British homes, only for those plans to be shelved. “For the first time in a long time we can see a positive picture,” he said.
His staff assess whether homes need cavity wall insulation, external rendering, ground source heat pumps or underfloor heating before arranging for the work to be done and later checking it is up to a high standard. This year he expects to employ an extra 50 HQ staff to cope with the flow of business from the government’s “10-point plan for a green industrial revolution” and particularly the seventh element: greener buildings.
Launched last November, Boris Johnson pledged a green plan to create 250,000 jobs by 2030, developing hydrogen technology, expanding the windfarm sector, building advanced nuclear power stations, and by cutting the carbon emissions of Britain’s 26m homes by 75-85%. About 50,000 jobs are due to be created in the building sector to meet emissions targets that Johnson believes will meet the UK’s obligations ahead of the United Nations Cop26 summit in Glasgow later this year. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who unveiled a £3bn post-pandemic green package last year that Labour described as inadequate, is expected to support the 10-point plan in his budget on 3 March with extra cash to meet a more ambitious £9.2bn Conservative manifesto pledge to improve the energy efficiency of homes, schools and hospitals. In the meantime, the government’s Green Homes Grant (GHG), which opened for business in September, is the main vehicle. Plagued by teething problems, the GHG voucher scheme was due to dispense £2bn by the end of this March giving homeowners two-thirds of the cost of energy-efficient improvements, up to a maximum of £5,000 a household, or the full cost up to £10,000 if residents have low incomes. Payment delays forced many installers to down tools and stop recruitment. Within three months of the launch, an embarrassed department of business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) had extended the scheme to March 2022. Horrocks, who is also head of the insulation industry body and regularly negotiates with officials from BEIS, recognises that finding 50,000 workers will be difficult while the construction industry is weighed down by its reputation as a cyclical business that traditionally hires and fires in sync with the ups and downs of property prices. “The industry is not the first choice for young people. It is not considered a desirable career. And that will only change if we reach out and convince them there are lots of opportunities in this green business,” he said. Training grants play a large part in his plans for expansion. Workers who render homes with insulating material can gain NVQs while architects are offered the necessary qualifications to become home assessors.
The financial rewards are also good, with specialist trades people earning more the £50,000 a year and mostly working indoors, unlike many construction workers. Industry optimism, however, is not universal. Simon Blackham, technical manager at insulation board manufacturer Recticel says the government’s funding initiatives are still too short term. That, he says, prevents firms from making major commitments to raise staff numbers. Regulations covering residential developments are another sore point. New homes will not have to meet tough emissions standards until 2025. Until then, only the most basic insulation is needed to satisfy the rules. “We can produce enough insulation panels for as many zero-carbon homes as the industry can build right now. There is plenty of manufacturing capacity. So there is no reason why we can’t build passive homes from today,” he said. Factories producing insulating materials are largely automated and job numbers are likely to stay largely the same, said Blackham, though he would increase staffing levels in marketing, warehousing and distribution should sales improve.
Simon Storer, chief executive of the Insulation Manufacturers Association, agreed that a firmer commitment from the government to insulate homes would guarantee manufacturing jobs rather than increase them. Economists say the same outlook applies to all parts of the UK’s “green” manufacturing sector: automation already dominates production and limits the creation of skilled jobs. Michael Pollitt, a business economist at the Judge Business school, Cambridge University, said that while 35 jobs are created in the broader recycling industry for every £1m invested, only 10 jobs are created by opening a gigafactory (battery factory). In the windfarm sector £1m creates just two jobs. The average for “green jobs” is five per £1m invested.
Any chance of a manufacturing bonanza is further undermined by the trend for much of the highly profitable, green industrial equipment to be developed and constructed abroad, from wind turbines to electric cars. Philip McCann, chair in urban and regional economics at Sheffield University’s management school, says the UK has struggled to develop a green industrial base because a postwar gap persists between innovative startup businesses and their larger cousins that might translate profitable ideas into mass production. A lack of skills training is another. “It is not a lack of money, it is about an over-centralised system when in the US and continental Europe, regions and cities have power and can tailor their support.”
Pollitt argues that Britain’s relatively small manufacturing base makes it ideally suited to making the transition to a zero-carbon economy. A flexible labour force also means that workers who find themselves unemployed, or in sectors damaged by the pandemic, can easily make the transition. “Britain’s advantage is that it has a largely decarbonised service sector that dominates the economy. If the UK cannot decarbonise then it is hard to see what country can.” But he also fears that the meagre sums of money dedicated to green grants and subsidies and the limited funding horizon will turn off workers. “Green jobs are seen as part of a short-term transition while the existing stock – which could be homes or power stations – are replaced.” That means green jobs do not look like a career even though a target to reach net zero by 2050 would make them an option for most people."
2021-02-05T08:49:15Z,business,Business,Shares in TikTok rival Kuaishou almost triple on market debut,"Shares in the Chinese video app Kuaishou almost tripled on the first day of trading in Hong Kong, giving TikTok’s chief rival a market value of £131bn. The debut of the short-form video site on Hong Kong’s stock exchange on Friday was one of the most eagerly anticipated initial public offerings (IPOs) this year and raised $5.4bn (£4bn), the biggest in the tech sector since Uber raised more than $8bn in 2019.
The company’s stock jumped 194% in early trading on Friday at HK$338 (£31.75) from the initial public offering price of HK$115. Kuaishou, which made a $1.1bn loss last year, competes in China with ByteDance, the owner of TikTok and its Chinese sister app, Douyin. The company said it had about 300 million daily active users, who spend an average of 86 minutes or more on the app. It makes money from activity including taking a small cut of the “tips” users leave for the creators who make content they particularly like, which come in the form of virtual gifts such as small digital “stickers” of objects, which account for about 62% of total revenues. Content creators make up about 26% of the app’s 769 million monthly active users.
It also makes money from livestreaming e-commerce, sometimes fronted by celebrities. Kuaishou’s revenues grew from $1.3bn in 2017 to $6.2bn in the nine months ending 30 September 2020 but it still reported a loss of $1.1bn. The company is in effect controlled by Su Hua, its chief executive, and Cheng Yixiao, the company’s founder and chief of product, through a special class of stock that gives them 10 times the voting power of ordinary shares. The stratospheric surge in Kuaishou’s shares has made the value of Hua’s 11.8% stake worth more than $21bn. Yixiao’s 9.2% shareholding is now worth almost $17bn. Other major shareholders include Tencent, which holds stakes in a vast array of businesses including Universal Music and Spotify. It controls 17.8%, which is now worth $32bn. Kuaishou was founded in 2012, originally as an app to allow users to make animated gifs, or images, on mobile phones. As smartphone technology swept the market, and mobile networks ramped up to handle large amounts of user data, the company shifted focus towards short videos. The company’s successful debut will be closely watched by Bytedance, which has previously been rumoured to be considering a flotation in Hong Kong, although recently Chinese tech companies have faced regulatory uncertainty. In November, the flotation of Jack Ma’s mobile payments firm Ant Group with a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai, which was planned to be the biggest share offering in history, was suspended by Chinese authorities at the last minute. Last month, Chinese regulators launched an anti-monopoly investigation into Alibaba, the online shopping and cloud computing giant also controlled by Ma."
2021-02-04T21:18:09Z,business,Business,All you need to know about negative interest rates,"The Bank of England has told high street banks and building societies they have six months to prepare for negative interest rates. BoE policymakers stressed that the request did not mean a cut in borrowing costs below zero was imminent or even likely, but with few tools left to boost the economy in the event of a downturn, the central bank needs negative rates to be available as an option. How do negative interest rates work? Instead of earning interest on money left with the Bank of England, when rates are negative, banks are charged to park their cash with the central bank. The European Central Bank, the Swiss and Danish central banks and Bank of Japan charge local banks to deposit money in the hope this will encourage them to stop hoarding funds, and instead lend more to each other, to consumers, and to businesses, in turn boosting the broader economy. What would happen to my mortgage? If it’s a fixed-rate mortgage, nothing will happen if interest rates are cut. Most households are on this type of deal; in recent years about nine in 10 new mortgages have been taken on a fixed rate. If it is a variable-rate mortgage – a tracker, or a mortgage on or linked to a lender’s standard variable rate – the rate could fall a little if the base rate is cut. But the drop is likely to be limited by terms and conditions. Nationwide building society, for example, will never reduce the rate it tracks below 0% on mortgages arranged since 2009. So if your mortgage is at base rate plus 1 percentage point, it will never fall below 1%.
What would happen to housebuyers arranging a mortgage? New mortgages may get cheaper, but rates for borrowers with large deposits are already low. Lenders could increase the margins on new tracker mortgages, so that the percentage rate you pay above the base rate is higher than on the current deals. Lenders are likely to ensure that they have a lower limit in their terms and conditions because they do not want to pay borrowers who have mortgages with them. What would it mean for savers? More misery. Rates on savings accounts have nosedived since the pandemic began and even the government-backed NS&I has slashed returns. A negative base rate is likely to lead to more accounts paying 0% or only slightly above that, meaning the value of deposits is further eroded by inflation. Wealthy savers could face a charge for holding large sums of money on deposit. UBS charges ultra-rich clients a fee for cash savings of more than €500,000 (£438,000), and reportedly plans to lower that threshold later this year. At the Danish Jyske Bank, similar charges apply. It could also mean that banks start to consider fees for current accounts. HSBC has already said that low interest rates could lead to it introducing fees on its accounts. What about loans and credit cards? Rates on personal loans are already low and are typically fixed once you take them out, so a negative interest rate will not affect your repayments. Credit card rates are usually low for new customers, but rise far above the base rate once introductory periods have ended, so will not be anywhere close to falling into negative territory."
2021-02-04T20:42:17Z,business,Business,"If you thought 2021 was the year for restraint on boardroom pay, think again","A pandemic and a recession would, you might think, force remuneration committees of public companies to pause and reflect. After many years of loose talk about showing “restraint” on boardroom pay, should 2021 be the year when the word means something? Maybe some companies are asking the question. But it’s striking how many pay proposals are creating controversy. After Cineworld and The Restaurant Group and others, here comes Future Publishing. Zillah Byng-Thorne, the chief executive of the firm behind magazines such as PC Gamer and Real Homes, has been paid a little over £25m over the past four years, so can’t really grumble about her lot. Future’s long-term shareholders also did well, it should be said, which is why Byng-Thorne’s incentive schemes came up trumps. If you invested £100 in Future in September 2015, your holding was worth almost £1,500 by September 2020. The company’s idea now, though, is to take potential jackpots up a few notches. Byng-Thorne would be able to make £40m in three tranches via the new proposal, while the finance director could top out at £17m. The duo would jointly comprise 20% of a plan that would cover all 2,300 employees. The virtues, as the company sees things, are twofold. First, Future’s share price would have keep to flying for the full payments to be triggered (an additional £4bn of shareholder value over five years, it calculates, at a company currently worth £2bn), and second, all staff are in the scheme. Yes, the proposal is less cheeky than, say, Cineworld’s, which involved executives with large shareholdings bullying other investors into accepting supercharged arrangements at a moment when the cinema group’s share price (unlike Future’s) is on the floor. Nor did Cineworld’s proposal include all staff. But Future’s plan still deserves a thumbs-down. By all means spread incentives across the organisation – that’s laudable. But potential £40m bonuses for FTSE 250 chief executives is a step beyond current norms at a bad moment. Next week’s vote represents another test for City fund managers, who tend to spout the same “restraint” line. They’ve flunked most of those tests recently. Musk’s ‘GameStonk’ tweet was a gamechanger for some
“I am become meme, destroyer of shorts,” tweeted Elon Musk, who seems to be enjoying his ability to cause nuclear-level havoc for short-sellers. Musk’s shout-out about Dogecoin, an obscure cryptocurrency, caused the price of a unit to surge. And last week Musk’s “Gamestonk” tweet preceded the last surge in the video game retailer’s share price. At one level, it’s harmless mischief, and one can understand why Musk might be entertained. In Tesla’s tricky early years, short-sellers’ bearish talk dominated the narrative around the electric car company and, arguably, made fundraising harder. But Musk should know that the chief beneficiaries of his price-moving tweets won’t always be small punters, which is perhaps what he imagines. The Wall Street Journal this week carried the intriguing tale of Senvest Management, a US hedge fund that banked a profit of nearly $700m from GameStop, having bought a 5% stake before the Reddit-inspired mania started. How did Senvest decide when to cash out completely? The clincher, it seems, was Musk’s “Gamestonk” tweet, which was a giveaway that peak silliness was close, which indeed it was. GameStop reached $450 and soon reversed. Yes, it’s helpful to have such neon-lit clues. Shell didn’t see which way the wind was blowing before share buyback The big event at Shell falls next week, which is when its chief executive, Ben van Beurden, tells the world how much capital he’s prepared to allocate to the renewables push, and how quickly. Thursday’s full-year results, therefore, were just a warm-up – which, admittedly, is an odd thing to say about a thumping pandemic-related loss of almost $20bn. But, since Shell and Van Beurden seem pleased with themselves for increasing the quarterly dividend slightly (having cut distributions by two-thirds last April), one cannot let the moment pass without reminding them of their horribly timed share buyback. Between July 2018 and January 2020, Shell spent $16bn on its own shares, all at prices above £22. The price today: £12.46. Shell can’t be blamed for failing to anticipate a pandemic and lower oil prices, of course. But, on a $16bn buyback, the difference between those two share prices represents a sum that would buy more than a few windfarms."
2021-02-04T19:53:10Z,business,Business,Bank of England: rapid GDP rebound likely as vaccines take effect,"The Bank of England expects a rapid rebound of the UK economy later this year as the vaccination programme takes effect, but also announced moves to introduce negative interest rates if the recovery falters. The Bank forecast a 4.2% slump in the first quarter, followed by a resurgence of economic activity as vaccinations allow the economy to return to brisk growth. The Threadneedle Street economists forecast that GDP will return to pre-pandemic levels by March 2022. However, the central bank also said it wanted high street lenders to prepare for negative rates by July, in case there was a fresh downturn and its monetary policy committee (MPC) needed to deploy them. The Bank said this was not a sign that the MPC was about to cut borrowing costs below zero.
Andrew Bailey, the BoE governor, said: “The monetary policy committee’s central forecast assumes that Covid-related restrictions and people’s health concerns weigh on activity in the near term, but that the vaccination programme leads to those easing, such that gross domestic product is projected to recover strongly from the second quarter of 2021, towards pre-Covid levels.” Bailey said the MPC was expanding its toolkit of measures to stimulate growth as an insurance policy in the event of a downturn and the committee was “clear that it did not wish to send any signal that it intended to set a negative bank rate at some point in the future”. There are fears that negative lending rates, which are expected to lower borrowing costs for households and businesses, would force high street banks and building societies to offer negative savings rates. Savers would suffer a loss of income, and pension funds, which also rely on deposit savings, would also be hit.
Officials said the balance of risks in the economy, mainly from new variants of Covid overwhelming the benefits of the current vaccination programme, meant it needed to keep rates low. The negative lending announcement came as MPC members voted unanimously to keep the official interest rate at the historically low level of 0.1%. The Bank’s quantitative easing bond-buying programme was left unchanged at £895bn after it pumped an additional £150bn into the economy at the outset of the second lockdown in November. Samy Chaar, chief economist at Swiss bank Lombard Odier, said the BoE was under pressure from financial markets to add negative rates to its armoury after a weak response to the pandemic by the Treasury.
He said the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank were not under pressure after the €750bn EU bailout and the Biden administration’s $1.1bn bailout. “The BoE needs to keep all options open when you see the lack of fiscal action in the UK,” he said. “The problem is that so much of the conversation – the political debate – in the UK is all about balancing the books. It makes no sense to be worrying about the debt in the current situation. But that is mentioned so often, it means everyone looks to the central bank for support,” he added. Earlier this week, the chair of the Building Societies Association said cutting the Bank’s lending rate to below zero would force institutions to subsidise savings rates to keep them positive, leaving them no option but to recoup the costs from higher mortgage rates. In December, banking executives from HSBC and Santander warned that their systems were not yet ready for negative rates.
Speaking to MPs on the Treasury committee, HSBC’s head of business banking, Amanda Murphy, said the bank had a programme under way, but that it was coming at a “considerable cost”. Her counterpart at Santander, Susan Allen, said the lender may need “12 to maybe 18 months” to properly prepare. Chaar said it was a myth that banks suffered excessively after the introduction of negative rates, which were usually introduced on lenders’ excess deposits at the central bank rather than the entire sum. The BoE base rate, which was cut to 0.1% last March as the UK prepared to go into its first lockdown, is the cost to high street lenders of borrowing money from the central bank, which heavily influences the cost of financing mortgages and loans to households and businesses."
2021-02-04T18:42:56Z,business,Business,Labour calls for 'smart' extension and overhaul of furlough scheme,"An indefinite extension and radical reform of the government’s flagship furlough scheme is urgently needed to save Britain from an unemployment crisis, the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, will say on Friday. Amid fears that the Treasury will unwind support for the economy too quickly, Dodds will call for a “smart” extension of Rishi Sunak’s wage subsidy programme as part of an emergency package of measures. Labour’s plan for jobs, seen by the Guardian, involves action to prolong and improve the furlough scheme, together with measures to help young people find work and steps to create hundreds of thousands of “clean, green” jobs.
Dodds will insist that Sunak, the chancellor, should not wait until the budget on 3 March to announce that the furlough – due to be wound up at the end of April – will remain in force for as long as health restrictions are in operation. She will say the UK could learn from Germany, France and the Netherlands, which have all included incentives and conditions in their furlough schemes to encourage job retention and training and to prevent abuse. Sunak is weighing up whether the speed of the UK’s vaccine programme will enable lockdown curbs on activity to be relaxed quickly enough to stick to plans to end the furlough – which has cost the government about £50bn so far – in less than three months’ time. Business groups including the British Chambers of Commerce have called for a time-limited extension of the furlough until the summer, while the TUC has said it should remain in place until the end of the year. The shadow chancellor will say, however, that the furlough’s length should not be pre-determined but should depend on the state of the economy. Labour also wants action to accelerate the government’s flagging Kickstart scheme for unemployed young people, under which only 2,000 placements have been made, and to make good on unfulfilled promises to link job creation to the fight against global heating. “Rishi Sunak’s plan for jobs has been a disaster,” Dodds will say. “Seven months after its launch, we’ve got record redundancies, soaring unemployment and the worst economic crisis of any major economy. “We need urgent action to secure, recover and create jobs. This must include a smarter furlough scheme, an overhaul of the failing Kickstart youth programme, and reform of the shambolic green homes grant as part of wider action to ‘build it in Britain’ and support the creation of 400,000 clean, new jobs. “People can’t afford to wait for the chancellor to get his act together. They need emergency action today, not more dither and delay until the budget.” The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that 18% of workers in UK businesses that have avoided going bust during the lockdowns of the past year are now on furlough. Dodds believes many of the 4.6 million workers now having part of their regular wages paid by the state will continue to need help well beyond April, because some sectors will remain affected by social distancing and others will take time to recover from months of disruption.
In order to avoid a damaging cliff edge, Labour is proposing there should be a revenue test so that firms that can demonstrate they are still hard-hit even after restrictions have been lifted can continue to access the scheme. Labour’s proposals involve employers being rewarded if they enable furloughed staff to access specific, accredited training. Dodds said French, German and Dutch schemes all incentivised training already, while the UK furlough did not. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development – the Paris-based thinktank for developed nations – has recommended that when unwinding furlough schemes governments should gradually shift the emphasis from protecting jobs to supporting vulnerable workers, with a focus on improving their skills. Dodds said a minority of firms were abusing the furlough, and those taking part should have to abide by certain conditions: Treat their staff well: no firing and rehiring. Suspend dividend payments for the duration of the scheme and suspend excessive executive renumeration. Firms above a certain size would commit to publishing a strategy on how they were reducing their carbon footprint and contributing to the transition to net zero. A commitment to tax transparency, for companies above a certain size. Sunak’s plan for jobs included a £2bn green homes grant to make UK homes more energy efficient while supporting the creation of 100,000 jobs. Dodds said businesses were reporting that they were laying off staff after being left out of pocket by the government."
2021-02-04T17:55:04Z,business,Business,"World is shifting to a more plant-based diet, says Unilever chief","Unilever has said expanding its range of plant-based foods is one of its new strategic priorities as the FTSE 100 company zooms in on the fastest-growing consumer markets. The group, which is behind household names such as Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream, Marmite and Dove soap, wants to have a €1bn(£865m)-a-year plant-based foods business in five to seven years’ time. That compares with a €200m business today. With a growing number of people cutting their meat intake or giving it up altogether, Alan Jope, Unilever’s chief executive, described the rise of plant-based foods as an “inexorable” trend. “We are seeing in every single country in the world a shift towards more plant-based diets, even in emerging markets,” he said.
The first step was creating plant-based versions of existing brands, such as the vegan Magnums and tubs of Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream already on sale. Hellman’s vegan mayonnaise, launched in 2018, was “doing brilliantly”, he added. Unilever also wants to grab more of the upmarket beauty and nutritional supplement markets, which are also big growth areas, an ambition that means more deals are on the cards. Recent acquisitions include the wellness brand Liquid IV and SmartyPants vitamins, while it already owns upmarket beauty brands such as Dermalogica, Ren and Living Proof. Analysts at Barclays have predicted the value of the global plant-based food and drink market could soar by more than 1,000% to exceed £100bn by the end of the decade. With the plant-based food market comprising lots of tiny businesses, acquisition targets for Unilever are less obvious than in other sectors. However, Jope said if it identified a promising candidate, “we will take a look at it”. It already owns meat substitute brand The Vegetarian Butcher. The group, which owns more than 400 brands, reported a 6% drop in underlying profits to €9.4bn on sales of €50.7bn on the back of a “volatile and unpredictable year”.
The lifestyle changes forced upon consumers by the pandemic mean the company has had to manage seesawing levels of demand over the past 12 months. While shoppers filled kitchen cupboards with Hellman’s, Pot Noodles and Cif surface spray, they cut back on its shampoos and deodorants. It was also hit by the closure of the restaurants and cafes it supplies with ice-cream. The Anglo-Dutch company, which manufactures 80% of the goods it sells in the UK on these shores, said it had experienced some Brexit-related teething problems, particularly around the flow of goods into Ireland, although the situation had since improved. “The next wave of rules are kicking in on 1 April and our team are very busy preparing to make sure that goes smoothly,” said Jope. The shares closed down 6% at £40.67. The figures were never going to “set the share price on fire”, said Dan Lane, a senior analyst at investment platform Freetrade, who said even big consumer firms such as Unilever were carrying battle scars from the pandemic."
2021-02-04T17:41:22Z,business,Business,"Negative interest rates are a possibility in UK, but far from a certainty | Larry Elliott","The Bank of England is a venerable institution. Not once since it was founded in 1694 have interest rates gone negative and there is no immediate prospect of that 327-year-long record ending. To be sure, the most interesting piece of news from Threadneedle Street’s quarterly monetary policy report was that banks and building societies have been given six months to get ready for the possibility that rates might need to go below zero. But a possibility is not the same as a probability, let alone a certainty, and the economy would have to be in a lot worse shape in August than the Bank’s nine-strong monetary policy committee expects to trigger such an unprecedented step.
All in all, the Bank is modestly optimistic about the prospects for the economy. Activity in the final three months of 2020 was “materially” stronger than it predicted in November and while the first three months of 2021 will be grisly, the envisaged 4% contraction will be much smaller than the near 19% drop during the first national lockdown last spring. When the restrictions are lifted the expectation is for the economy to bounce back, helped by consumers spending a chunk of the money they have saved during the past 12 months. The City’s money markets might be pricing in negative rates, but by the time the financial system is ready for them the economy should be growing fast.
Instead, negative rates should be seen as an insurance policy in case things turn out much less well than the Bank is predicting, as is entirely possible. These are especially uncertain times, and nobody would rule out the risk that a new variant of Covid-19 might emerge that proves resistant to the current vaccines. Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s governor, stressed that there was a difference between having negative rates as part of the toolkit and actually using them. Similarly, nothing should be read into the fact that the staff at Threadneedle Street have been told to draw up plans for how policy might be tightened in the future. Negative rates would affect the balances of commercial banks held at the Bank of England. The interest rates on mortgages, overdrafts and credit cards would remain positive, in some cases markedly so. But moving to negative rates would still be a massive step, and one that would only be taken once the Bank has exhausted all other options."
2021-02-04T17:16:17Z,business,Business,Pound rallies as negative interest rates seen less likely - as it happened,"Thatâ€™s all for today. Time for a quick recap. The Bank of England has given the UKâ€™s commercial banks six months to be ready for the possibility of cutting interest rate below zero. But at its latest monetary policy meeting, the BoE also stressed this isnâ€™t a sign that negative interest rates are likely.
The pound rallied against the euro, hitting â‚¬1.141 for the first time since last May, as traders cut bets that interest rates could turn negative soon. With the economy hopefully recovering by this summer, several experts predicted that it would not be necessary to cut rates below 0% to stimulate growth. The BoE also predicted that the UK economy would shrink by around 4% in the current quarter, before a vaccine-spurred revival takes hold. UK car dealers have suffered their weakest January sales figures since 1970, with registrations slumping 40% the lockdown forced showrooms to close.
Construction firms also reported a drop in activity last month, as the pandemic hit client confidence. Builders also reported supply problems due to port disruption, and higher materials prices. Here are more of todayâ€™s stories:

2021-02-04T14:45:27Z,business,Business,UK new car sales fall 40% in January as lockdown bites,"Just over 90,000 new cars were sold in the UK in the slowest January for more than 50 years, according to industry figures released on Thursday. Sales fell 40% compared with January 2020 to 90,249, as the closure of car showrooms under lockdown compounded the economic gloom. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said the uptake of “click and collect” sales had prevented an even greater fall but could not avert the worst start to a year since 1970. The SMMT forecasts that 2021 sales will rebound slightly from the depths of 2020, but said the industry would face a very subdued and challenging year, with showroom closures depressing demand and manufacturing output. New car sales fell by 29% last year to 1.63m vehicles, the lowest level since 1992. Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said: “Following a £20.4bn loss of revenue last year, the auto industry faces a difficult start to 2021.” He said the UK’s lockdown was necessary but that it would “challenge society, the economy and our industry’s ability to move quickly towards our ambitious environmental goals”. “Every day that showrooms can safely open will matter, especially with the critical month of March looming,” he said. The highest monthly vehicle sales are normally recorded in March when the number plate changes, accounting for almost a fifth of annual registrations. The chief executive of the National Franchised Dealers Association, Sue Robinson, said retailers were optimistic about the year ahead if dealerships were able to reopen as soon as safely possible. “Sales will likely be fuelled by pent-up demand, rising registrations of low- and zero-emission vehicles and the increasing importance of car ownership,” she said. Lenders said the impact of Brexit was also starting to show. The managing director of Close Brothers Motor Finance, Seán Kemple, said: “Ford has upped prices on some models due to the nature of their production lines across the globe, and there’s a risk other manufacturers will follow suit.”
Diesel vehicles fell further from favour, accounting for just 12% of new cars sold in January. Electric car sales were up more than 50% to 6,260. At 40, there were almost twice as many models on the UK market than at the start of 2020. Pure battery and plug-in hybrid models together accounted for almost one in seven of all cars sold. Auto Trader’s commercial director, Ian Plummer, said sales of greener vehicles still did not account for any meaningful levels of volumes. “The plethora of new EVs [all-electric vehicles] on the market gives consumers some excellent options, but the high price tags hold many back from turning interest into purchase,” he said. The SMMT said the CO2 emissions of new cars sold in 2020 were 11.8% lower than the previous year at an average of 112.8g/km, but that there could be “no let-up in the pace of environmental improvement”. The industry has to reach a UK-only fleet average target of 95g/km this year or face large financial penalties."
2021-02-04T14:07:39Z,business,Business,Teletext Holidays faces questions over failure to offer Covid refunds,"Teletext Holidays has become the latest travel firm to be investigated by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for failing to refund customers. The CMA said it had received hundreds of complaints from people who had not been given back the money they paid for package holidays the company was forced to call off due to the pandemic. Holidaymakers with package holidays are entitled to a full refund within 14 days when the tour operator cancels. However, Teletext Holidays has been pushing customers towards credit notes or new bookings. Customers who demanded their money back after December cancellations have reported being ignored by the company. Others have described having to wait over six months for refunds after trips were cancelled as far back as July.
Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA, said: “We understand that the pandemic is presenting challenges for travel businesses, but it is important that the interests of consumers are properly protected and that businesses comply with the law. “We’ll be engaging with Teletext to establish whether the law has been broken and will take further action if necessary.” A spokesperson from Truly Travel which operates the Teletext Holidays brand said: “Despite the adverse conditions that the travel industry faces and the lack of industry-specific support provided by the government, the business continues to work hard to process refunds as quickly as possible and will work closely with the CMA in order to reach a satisfactory outcome for all our customers as quickly as possible.” Thursday’s announcement is the latest action by the watchdog in relation to holiday cancellations and refunds. The CMA has written to more than 100 package holiday firms to remind them of their obligations to comply with consumer protection law. It has secured refund commitments from a number of holiday firms, including Love Holidays, Lastminute.com, Virgin Holidays, Tui UK, Sykes Cottages and Vacation Rentals, although in recent days the Guardian has heard from a consumer who is still waiting for their money.
The CMA is also investigating whether airlines have breached consumers’ legal rights by failing to offer cash refunds for flights they could not lawfully take as a result of the pandemic. Telextext Holidays started out on the ITV Teletext service and made a name for itself as the place to get a cheap last-minute holiday, long before travellers used the internet to find breaks. Passengers would book on the Friday night and head straight to the airport for a departure the following day."
2021-02-04T13:47:33Z,business,Business,Janet Yellen warns of 'tough months ahead' for Covid-hit US economy,"Treasury secretary Janet Yellen on Thursday warned of “tough months ahead” before the US economy gets to the other side if the coronavirus-related crisis. She also said that she and financial market regulators needed to “understand deeply” what happened in the trading frenzy involving GameStop and other retail stocks in recent days before taking any action. Yellen, who is convening a meeting of top market regulators on Thursday, told ABC’s Good Morning America: “We really need to make sure that our financial markets are functioning properly, efficiently and that investors are protected.”
She added: “We’re going to discuss … whether or not the recent events warrant further action.” In her first television interview since being confirmed as Joe Biden’s treasury secretary, having previously served as chair of the federal reserve – the first time a woman has held either of those posts – Yellen also urged Congress to “act forcefully” on the coronavirus relief package now under discussion there. Biden, US president and Yellen want a huge $1.9tn package to be passed, preferably with bipartisan support, although a group of moderate Republicans has suggested a bill worth less than a third of that. Yellen warned “we have got some tough months ahead” on the economy before it “gets to the other side” of the coronavirus-related crisis and she said the picture was “as serious as any I have seen in my lifetime”. “We need to act forcefully to make sure Americans do not suffer needlessly,” she said. The treasury secretary forecast that if Congress passes the bill as currently outlined, it could reduce child poverty in the US by 50 percent and she wanted to “make sure this package gets into law”. Democrats are hoping to pass legislation on further coronavirus relief by March – with or without Republican support. “Seeing long lines of people waiting to get food is something we should never see in the United States,” Yellen said, adding: “There are people worrying about whether they will have a roof over their heads and [Biden] will address that urgent need.”"
2021-02-04T12:19:46Z,business,Business,"Home workers putting in more hours since Covid, research shows","Employees who work from home are spending longer at their desks and facing a bigger workload than before the Covid pandemic hit, two sets of research have suggested. The average length of time an employee working from home in the UK, Austria, Canada and the US is logged on at their computer has increased by more than two hours a day since the coronavirus crisis, according to data from the business support company NordVPN Teams. UK workers have increased their working week by almost 25% and, along with employees in the Netherlands, are logging off at 8pm, it said. NordVPN Teams analysed data from its servers to see how private business networks were being used by employees working remotely. Separate research shared with the Guardian by the remote team-building firm Wildgoose found 44% of UK employees reported being expected to do more work over the last year, with those at mid-sized firms most likely to report an increased workload. The surveys also showed home workers taking shorter lunch breaks, working through sickness, and more workers being “always on” as the split between working and leisure time is blurred. When asked what their company could do better to address burnout or stress while working from home, 55% said it would help if their employer kept communication and work expectations within working hours. Company owners were also struggling, with nearly two in five saying they had suffered from depression, anxiety or exhaustion over the past year. NordVPN Teams’s figures, first published by Bloomberg, show that in January workers in the UK and US were typically logged on for 11 hours a day – up from nine hours in the UK and eight in the US before lockdowns began in March 2020.
Workers in Canada also increased the number of hours they were online from nine to 11 a day. However, the number of hours worked by people in Denmark, Belgium and Spain have fallen back to pre-pandemic levels. “Online working hours across some European countries have started to stabilise with employees having had the opportunity to return to the office in some capacity,” NordVPN Teams said. “However, employees in the UK and the Netherlands are working until 8pm, regularly logging off later than usual to wrap up an extended working day.” The data showed no significant drop in the use of business virtual private networks (VPNs) at lunchtime, which the firm said could indicate people taking shorter lunch breaks while working remotely. Wildgoose’s managing director, Jonny Edser, said: “While we’ve all grown used to home working as the pandemic has continued, it continues to present huge challenges in maintaining the right work/life balance. “With increased workloads and a worrying trend of working through sickness, people’s jobs are becoming ever more blurred with their home lives at a time when it’s crucial the two can remain distinct from each other.” Emma Stewart, a co-founder of flexible working consultancy Timewise, said during lockdown forms of flexible working, in particular part-time work, were being forgotten. “The working day is at risk of losing its barriers and there will be real impact on mental health and wellbeing,” she said. A third survey, this time of freelancers, by the recruitment website Worksome found employees were also reporting doing longer working days since the Covid crisis. Worksome’s chief executive, Morten Petersen, said for many people “switching off of our ‘work mode’ when we work and live in the same house, flat, or even room, has become extremely difficult. “The temptation to answer emails late into the night has become even greater.” Ceri-Jane Hackling, the managing director of Cerub Public Relations, said she and her colleague were generally working at least an hour to an hour and a half extra a day.
“If we’re in the office there’s a start time and finish time which we generally adhere to unless there’s something very urgent, but at home and if you’re busy you don’t notice the time and you haven’t got colleagues to remind you to go home. As we’re not able to see friends or go to the gym there’s no impetus to leave either. All my exercise classes and social events are on Zoom so I don’t have to leave at 5.30pm to get there so it’s easy to just carry on working.” She said she had found herself booking more meetings than she would have previously because she no longer had to travel for them, but online meetings were often taking longer “and because they’re easier to log into, more people are involved”. “Other people’s circumstances also impact us so the working hours of some clients and contacts needing to home school are different to ours so tasks that require input from different people take longer or we find ourselves replying to emails out of our usual hours in order to meet deadlines.”"
2021-02-04T11:33:08Z,business,Business,Price of dogecoin rises by 50% following Elon Musk tweet,"The price of dogecoin, a cryptocurrency, has soared after Elon Musk underlined his power as a market tipster by tweeting about it. Dogecoin’s price rose by 50% on 4 February shortly after Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and the world’s richest person, tweeted that “Dogecoin is the people’s crypto”.
“No highs, no lows, only Doge”, he added. He also tweeted a meme featuring himself and dogecoin in Disney’s The Lion King.
Dogecoin, which uses a shiba inu dog meme as its logo, was started in 2013 as a joke, after the invention of bitcoin prompted a wave of imitator cryptocurrencies. However, the joke caught on, and the coins had a market value of $6.3bn (£4.6bn) on Thursday morning, according to Coinmarketcap.com, a cryptocurrency data provider. The value of a single coin rose to $0.05204 that Thursday morning, up by almost three cents in 24 hours. The volume of trading more than tripled over the course of the day.
Last month, Musk became the world’s richest person, above Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, as the value of his shareholding in Tesla soared, in part because of huge interest in the electric car pioneer from amateur and retail investors as well as from large institutions. Musk has long been a prolific user of social media, with a familiarity with online culture that is unusual among prominent chief executives. He had vowed on Tuesday to take a break from Twitter, before returning with comments that pumped up the value of dogecoin. In recent weeks Musk’s tweets and comments have moved financial markets. At the height of the retail share trading mania surrounding GameStop, a US videogame retailer, he tweeted “Gamestonk”, a reference to stock market memes.
The price of bitcoin also rose in the last week after Musk said that he was a “supporter” of the cryptocurrency in an interview carried on Clubhouse, a new social media app focused on audio. In the same interview Musk said previous comments about dogecoin were “really just meant to be jokes”. Bitcoin’s price rose above $38,000 last week after Musk changed his Twitter biography to “#bitcoin”. On Thursday morning bitcoin hit a high of $38,741.58. Musk’s Twitter posts have previously caused him trouble. In 2019 Musk reached a settlement with US regulators after he falsely tweeted that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share."
2021-02-04T11:28:18Z,business,Business,BT warns rural areas will suffer broadband delays unless government steps up,"People living in rural areas could face a further delay in getting next-generation full-fibre broadband unless the government stops dragging its feet and removes financial barriers, the chief executive of BT has warned. Millions of homes face being last on the list to receive rural broadband because they are commercially unattractive for operators to reach with full-fibre broadband, which could put rural residents at risk of becoming “second-class” citizens in the digital revolution. Philip Jansen said that exemption on a form of business rates, charged on the new networks once they are built, would be worth £1bn to BT, money that could be spent on connecting about 3m homes. The BT boss has said that the government and telecoms regulator Ofcom need to remove financial and regulatory barriers to help firms building full-fibre and gigabit networks or rollout targets would be missed. He said that while the government has “said a lot”, there is now an “urgency” to act if it is to have a hope of meeting its goal of 85% coverage of all homes in the UK with gigabit speed broadband by 2025. “The biggest contribution the government can make are on cumulo rates, essentially business rates charged on the new networks once they are built; it risks significantly slowing our progress,” he said. “Exemption on these rates would be worth about £1bn to BT alone, equivalent to [getting full-fibre broadband to] about 3m premises. Without it we may need to rethink the pace and shape of our fibre build and those living in rural areas may need to wait longer.” BT is investing £12bn to roll-out full-fibre broadband to 20m premises by the mid- to late 2020s. In November, the government diluted its target from Boris Johnson’s election pledge of a full-fibre connection for every home by 2025, to 85% coverage with gigabit speed coverage, and said it would look to spend £1.2bn of a £5bn commitment to subsidise expansion in to commercially unattractive rural areas. Earlier this month, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), parliament’s spending watchdog, criticised the government for a catalogue of failures relating to the rollout saying it would miss its 2025 target. “Look at the PAC report, the government has said a lot but we would like to see extra money to build in really rural areas quickly,” said Jansen. “We want to go as fast as we possibly can and build as much [in] rural [areas] as we possibly can, the government can help us on cumulo and not tax us on the build.”
But he also implored Ofcom to introduce what it believes are fair regulatory relief measures to encourage investment in the rollout in its Wholesale Fixed Telecoms Market Review which will be published next month. These include price controls for 10 to 15 years, to protect the return on BT’s £12bn investment that it said would take 20 years to pay off, and not to be too quick to step in to regulate. “We are not looking for some super-normal return, just a fair return,” said Jansen. “BT is ready, willing and able to build like fury and fibre up the UK but we need Ofcom to come good on creating a climate that encourages investment and the government to show some urgency in removing barriers. There has been plenty of time for talking now we need to turbo charge the move to the next generation of connectivity.”"
2021-02-04T08:47:47Z,business,Business,Shell makes $20bn loss as Covid crisis downgrades assets,"Royal Dutch Shell plunged to a loss of almost $20bn (£14.7bn) last year after the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the global oil market stripped about $22bn from the value of its oil and gas assets. The oil company was forced to write down its assets after a slump in oil and gas market prices, leading the company to a loss of $19.9bn compared with a profit of $15.3bn the year before. The adjusted financial result – which excludes the heavy hit to the value of its assets – fell by more than 80% to a profit of $4.8bn for the year, the company’s weakest full-year profits in at least two decades. The historic financial toll caused by the coronavirus also hit BP, which reported its first full-year financial loss since the Deepwater Horizon disaster earlier this week, and US oil company ExxonMobil reported its first annual loss ever. Oil companies were hard hit by the sudden slump in oil prices last April as demand for transport fuels plummeted after sweeping travel restrictions to stem the spread of the virus. The global oil price fell to less than $20 a barrel, and has since recovered to $56 a barrel. The price remains well below the highs of $75 in 2019. Ben van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive, said the company took “tough but decisive actions” to weather “an extraordinary year”. It cut up to 9,000 jobs last year, including more than 300 in the UK, and also slashed its dividend for the first time since 1945. But Van Beurden said the company had emerged from 2020 “ready to accelerate our strategy and make the future of energy”, and begin growing its dividend again. Shell’s US dollar-denominated shareholder payouts will grow by 4% in the first quarter, he said.
The decision to increase Shell’s dividend for a second consecutive quarter is likely to be viewed by the market as a sign of confidence in the future of the oil industry as the rollout of vaccines potentially eases travel restrictions. But Shell will face the challenge of a growing dividend against the backdrop of rising pressure to reduce its carbon emissions and cut its net debt – which grew by $1.9bn to $75.4bn in the last quarter of 2020 – amid lower oil prices. Shell said last year it expected global oil prices to remain well below average 2019 levels for the next three years. It has forecast oil prices to average $35 a barrel in 2020, rising to $40 in 2021, $50 in 2022 and $60 in 2023. The average oil price last year was $64.36 a barrel."
2021-02-04T06:00:28Z,business,Business,'Lost generation of unemployed': Covid hits careers of over-50s,"Lisa Griffiths, a 61-year-old special needs nanny, has spent her career easily moving from one contract to the next. So when her last, five-year contract ended recently, she was shocked to find new employment opportunities far more limited than she had expected. Then, while she was considering her options, the pandemic hit and work dried up altogether. “It’s been a real shock for me, and my fear is that if this enforced unemployment is not only to do with the pandemic but my age as well – I have no evidence that it is ageism but I have a strong feeling that it is – then things are going to get worse and not better,” she said.
“If I retire earlier than the state pension age and then my husband loses his job, it would be a catastrophe,” she added. “I know there are things like universal credit but we’ve never had to lean on government support before and I’m not sure that my husband would even entertain the idea.” Since the Equality Act 2010 made it illegal to discriminate against someone based on age, employment rates among people aged 50-plus have steadily risen. Before the pandemic, rates had reached a historic high, with a record 10.7 million people aged 50 and over in work – nearly a third of the UK workforce. The story of older people and employment was largely one of those rare things: a good news story that brought almost everyone and everything with it, individuals, society and the economy alike.
This economic trajectory made everyone a winner, said Lily Parsey from the International Longevity Centre UK. “One common argument against greater labour market participation in older age is that it will somehow prevent younger people from entering paid employment by taking all the jobs from them,” she said. This argument is, however, built on false assumptions: in March 2020, at least 80% of employment growth in the UK was estimated to come from workers over the age of 50. There were, of course, parts of the demographic untouched by the good news. Even before the pandemic, there were about 800,000 people aged 50-64 not in work, who wanted to be. More than 1 million 50-64s were out of work for health reasons, 300,000 of whom wanted a job. Nevertheless, things were going in the right direction. But then the pandemic struck. It has been, of course, disastrous for great swathes of workers across the board, especially those aged 18-24, whose employment rate has fallen 3.5 percentage points (ppt) since March compared with just 0.4 ppt for those aged between 35 and 49. For older workers, the drop in employment has been somewhere in the middle, at 1 ppt. But cut the data another way – in terms of percentage increase of unemployment – and the age group most affected by the pandemic are those aged 50 or over. There are now 91,000 more unemployed older people than there were 12 months ago: an increase of a third in a single year, significantly more than in any other age group. That third is significantly more than both the national average increase of 24% and the 25% increase in unemployed people aged 18-24. For those aged 25-34, the increase was 28%, and for those aged 35-49, the increase was 19%. That third represents 407,000 individual stories of later life unemployment, a group that now makes up one in four of all unemployed people in the UK.
This matters because despite the advances of the last decade, redundancy is a particularly age-related problem: people aged over 50 who lose their jobs are significantly more likely to suffer long-term unemployment than other age groups, with older workers who lose their jobs being more than twice as likely as other age groups to be unemployed for at least two years. Another worrying point, made by Dr Anna Dixon from the Centre for Ageing Better, is that the apparently healthy-ish employment rate for those aged over 50 is masking something else: people who are on furlough, or who have had their hours cut, are still showing up in this data as “employed”. But their job may not be safe. “Over the summer, furlough rates showed a U-shape, with younger and older workers the most likely to be away from work,” said Dixon. By September, however, furloughed 55-64s were the least likely to be fully back at work. “So, while it superficially looks like older workers will be ‘second-hardest’ hit by job losses in this recession, once we factor in the fact that it is older workers who are at greatest risk of long-term unemployment, it is clear that after this pandemic there could be a lost generation of unemployed over-50s forced into an early retirement they neither want nor can afford,” said Dixon.
This, said Stuart Lewis, founder of Rest Less, the jobs site for the over-50s, is catastrophic for hundreds of thousands of older people. Contrary to popular belief, he said, most fifty- and sixtysomethings are not revelling in their gold-plated, final salary pensions – a long-lost preserve of their parents’ generation – and they haven’t had enough time under pensions auto-enrolment to have amassed equivalent savings. Instead, said Lewis, many face a significantly underfunded retirement and are seeing what savings they do have decimated by the pandemic. This in turn will lead to a significant long-term drop in their future retirement income – and spending – which risks stalling the UK’s economic recovery for years to come. “Those in their 50s and 60s are in a far more financially precarious position than most people imagine,” he said. “It’s tragic to think that more than 626,000 over-50s are now claiming universal credit, meaning that after three decades in the workplace, they have less than £16,000 of savings to their name to qualify for universal credit. “It’s also useful to reflect that in the last recession women could retire at 60 and receive the state pension; today it’s 66,” he added. “This means that someone made redundant at the age of 55 still has to find meaningful work, or try to survive on universal credit, for the next 11 years before they can claim the state pension.” Everyone agrees that this isn’t just a personal tragedy for the older generation, it’s a problem for us all: harnessing the potential of workers, regardless of their age, will be crucial in the post-pandemic recovery. With an ageing population, we cannot afford to leave anyone behind."
2021-02-04T06:00:27Z,business,Business,Britain's Covid unemployed: 'a major driver of stress and anxiety',"The Guardian spoke to people who have been made unemployed due to Covid and their experiences of trying to find work. The performing arts project manager ‘There’s been nothing’ In Leicester, Martin Bailey, who has 35 years experience and worked as a project manager in the performing arts sector until October, said his “mental health has suffered” from being out of work. “There’s been nothing,” said the 57-year-old. “All live events and festivals have been cancelled, so there’s just no work. “I’ve had to borrow money but now that’s running out. I’m even thinking of moving out of my house and doing a bit of sofa surfing, which isn’t something I want to do at my age.” Bailey has been applying for jobs but says they are all “oversubscribed”. He adds: “I know from processing job applications myself that when I put my age in, being over 55 puts you pretty low down on the priority list.” He thinks the future of the performing arts in the UK will be a “struggle” and doesn’t think the government supports the arts enough. “It’s going to be much diminished and it’s got worse with Brexit,” he said. “There’s a lot of investment going into German theatres while they’re closed, to do repairs, renovations and upgrades financed by the government. We don’t get anything really here. “We have a different approach to culture and the arts – we like to celebrate how special it is here but in reality we don’t value it or the people that create it.” The graduate ‘Sometimes I feel a sense of hopelessness’
“Financial insecurity is a major driver of stress and anxiety,” said the 24-year-old graduate Joe Bailey from Cheshire. “I now have around £50,000 debt from university but my qualifications don’t seem to be able to secure much advantage.” Bailey graduated with a master’s in geopolitics from Royal Holloway, University of London last year. He volunteers with the Labour party and hopes to work in politics. “The applications themselves are fairly long and it can be quite frustrating as it’s very rare that you’ll get any feedback. You feel quite good when you apply, but when you don’t get a response you don’t know what you’ve done wrong. He has applied for around 100 jobs, many of which are in London. But, he says: “Most of the roles in politics are unpaid or part-time, and it’s impossible for me to live in the city on a three-day wage. There are a few union jobs that are regional and closer to home, but other than that there’s not really anything here. “Sometimes I feel like the hard work I did at university is somewhat redundant and I’m left feeling a sense of hopelessness.”"
2021-02-04T06:00:27Z,business,Business,Closed doors and lives in limbo: young Britons face Covid jobs crisis,"When law student Rima Begum graduated on a Zoom call this summer, she felt a sense of pride as one of the first in her family to go to university. Despite the economic uncertainty brought by the pandemic, she was confident she would find work to fund a master’s degree. Now, she is less hopeful. “I have applied for 35 to 40 jobs but I imagine 40% of my applications have not even been read,” she says, explaining how she spends the whole day on her laptop in her parents’ home, where she lives. “A lot of these jobs are basic administration roles in law and I get a notification that 300 to 400 people have applied. I think: is there any point?” Rima, 22, relied on her retail job in Oxford Circus, London, to buy food and supplies while an undergraduate but, after a period of furlough, the store is now shutting, leaving her future uncertain. Her story is mirrored across the country, as thousands of people aged between 18 and 24 – many who usually work in hard-hit sectors such as hospitality – struggle to find employment after being furloughed or as they enter the jobs market. Unemployment for those aged 16 to 24 increased by 124,000 to 597,000. This compares with 407,000 people over the age of 50.
The Graduate Market in 2020 report shows that the number of entry-level graduate jobs has taken a big hit – down nearly 11% in 2020 – as a result of the pandemic. That is the largest annual decrease since the financial crisis in 2009. Recruitment levels are down at more than half of the UK’s leading graduate employers. Experts warn of the long-term impacts of this, including lower future pay and employment prospects. They say it may also influence the mental and physical health of young people in later years. Data from the Resolution Foundation found the post-furlough fall into unemployment had been most common among 18-24-year-olds (19%), as well as BAME workers (22%). “I have not even planned for not finding another job,” says Rima. “I have to get one to do my master’s degree next year.”
“There is a noticeable change in the market compared to when I’ve looked before. There are fewer jobs and also a lot of graduate schemes I had my eye on have been paused due to the pandemic.” Employers in all sectors are cutting back. John Lewis, for instance, has cancelled its graduate scheme this year, the Sanctuary Group has done the same, as has Danske bank. For those still running, the number of applicants has shot up. KPMG, one of the big four accounting organisations, said its graduate programme had seen about a 50% increase in applications in the first three months for the 2021 intake compared with last year. The situation is also hard for those not in education or training. Kerel Babb, 20, left school after his GCSEs and is working in music. He usually takes shifts at Winter Wonderland, an annual event in London’s Hyde Park, but there was no work there this winter because it was cancelled . “Usually at the end of summer you see jobs advertised for Christmas, but it wasn’t really the case this year. It’s been difficult as I am a proactive person, and I don’t like to just sit around,” he says. “I cashed out £10 this whole year from music. My main income is universal credit. It’s not enough to sustain me but it’s what got me studio equipment,” he says.
The proportion of those receiving universal credit who are young people has increased to its highest level since November 2017. Kate Bell, head of rights, international, social and economics at the trade union TUC says the government needs to extend the temporary uplift of universal credit and also wants the government to provide more support for those looking for apprenticeships, as the numbers available have been “dropping fast”. The government has brought in a £2bn “kickstart” scheme to help young people. Through it, employers can offer those claiming universal credit a six-month work placement funded by the government. Victoria Head, director of skills and employability at the charity Catch22, a not-for-profit business with a social mission that operates in the UK, said they worry people will be dropped after the six months so are offering additional support, such as extra training and wellbeing help where needed. Bell says it is a good start and so far about 20,000 placements have been allocated, but she has “concerns over the quality” of them. “Will they be paid more than living wages? And will the private sector come forward with jobs? She said there were three solutions to the current crisis. The first is making sure furlough schemes are in place for as long as necessary, and not withdrawing support too soon. Both unions and private sector bosses back such an extension. The second is more help and a specific strategy for certain sectors, like retail, where tens of thousands of jobs have been wiped out as a result of long term closures and corporate collapses. Third, there is a real need for job creation in other sectors where there are shortages, such as social care. The creative industries employ a lot of young people and it has been particularly hit this year, with artists concerned about a lack of dedicated help. Throughout her university degree in professional musicianship, Ellie Levy Pepper was working towards becoming a jazz residency singer. She says: “It’s incredibly difficult for any young aspiring musician in any climate, let alone the current one. “It’s very depressing knowing I could be achieving my dream by working in an industry I love at this very moment if it weren’t for the pandemic. It also affects my songwriting and creativity, which in turn worsens my mood as I’m stuck indoors all day.” If youth unemployment isn’t tackled it will have long term implications, according to Prof Ronald McQuaid from the University of Stirling, who says those who are unemployed when they are younger are likely to be unemployed later in life. “There is an argument that in a cohort with lots of youth unemployment such as now – and it was the same in 2008-9 – the impact does tend to be bigger because the number of good jobs available is reduced and people don’t get on to the same ladder as others. And when the economy does improve a few years later the new cohort of people coming through then take opportunities.” However, he notes that because of the ageing population, and the need for younger workers, there could be less scarring in this generation and a quicker recovery for them. He says there was also evidence on unemployment and poor mental health, produced in Sweden, which shows those who experience joblessness have lower life satisfaction. To alleviate some of these risks he says it was vital to keep people in the labour market through career development and apprenticeship opportunities. Head from Catch22 said the longterm effects would be a “forgotten generation” and “mass unemployment” with impact on people’s mental health and wellbeing. Some of the wellbeing impacts are already being felt. Rima, an ambitious young woman who has always wanted to be a lawyer since she went on a school trip to a court in year 11, details her daily concerns: “I worry and sometimes it’s constant. I am good at trying to push it away but it’s still there,” she says. “I feel like my generation is forgotten about at the moment.”"
2021-02-04T06:00:26Z,business,Business,"Fix gaps in furlough for self-employed workers, government urged","The government is under mounting pressure to plug gaps in its emergency coronavirus wage subsidy schemes at the March budget to support millions of self-employed people and other workers excluded from furlough. MPs and campaign groups said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, had repeatedly ducked opportunities to fix gaps in furlough and the self-employed income support scheme (SEISS) for almost a year since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Caroline Lucas, the Green party co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group Gaps in Support, said it was “completely unacceptable” that more than 3 million people had been completely left out.
“While it was understandable at the beginning of the pandemic, when the Treasury had to act fast, that some new support schemes didn’t work as well as they should, it’s a scandal that over 10 months later, so many are still falling through the gaps,” she told the Guardian. “The chancellor must now accept that there are genuine and problematic gaps in the schemes he designed, and make support for excluded groups a centrepiece of his budget announcement next month.” The government’s flagship furlough scheme has topped up the wages of almost 10m jobs since its launch in March last year, while as many as 2.7m claims have been made to SEISS, the Treasury’s similar provision for self-employed people. However, experts have warned millions of people have missed out because they fail to meet eligibility criteria.
Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, said the government needed to take action at the budget. “Self-employed people are the backbone of the British economy, which is why Labour has called repeatedly for the chancellor to plug the gaps in his support schemes.” The interventions come as the Guardian profiles the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on employment as the British economy grapples with the worst recession for 300 years. Sunak is also coming under pressure to extend the furlough scheme, amid warnings from business and unions of widespread unemployment without further financial assistance. Official figures show full-time work has risen during the pandemic to the highest levels on record despite the impact of Covid on the labour market. However, part-time jobs and self-employment has plunged, as freelancers and those in precarious work bear the brunt of the crisis.
At the start of the pandemic there were 5.1 million self-employed people in the UK. This has now fallen to below 4.6 million. About 3 million people have been excluded from the government’s support schemes, according to the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE), including about 700,000 limited company directors and 200,000 people who had recently set out working for themselves and lacked documentation to receive wage subsidies. As many as one-in-five small-company bosses surveyed by the Federation of Small Business (FSB) have said they received no financial support at all from the government. Mike Cherry, national chairman of the FSB, said this meant as many as one million small business owners had been “left out in the cold”. Urging rapid action before the budget, he added: “There are some extremely concerning gaps and misguided criteria. We need action to address these glaring omissions now. Budget announcements in March, with actual changes taking effect after that, will prove too late.” The number of self-employed workers on universal credit benefits has risen by more than 300% since the start of the crisis to reach more than 200,000. IPSE said the chancellor urgently needed to reform the SEISS to extend it to people who could now prove their income using 2019-20 tax returns, as well as to help company directors and those earning over the £50,000 threshold for support. Rachel Flower, a spokesperson for the ExcludedUK campaign group, which represents workers who have missed out on support, said: “A year on from the start of the pandemic the government is well aware the exclusions exist, but has not been minded to fix them. And that is a social injustice.”
“It has pushed a whole sector of society into debt and poverty, in direct contrast to those who have been fairly supported.” A spokesperson for the Treasury said the government had done all it can to help as many people as possible during the pandemic. “Funding is designed to target those who need it most and protect the taxpayer against fraud and abuse. “For those who are not eligible for our support schemes, they can still benefit from help like our strengthened welfare safety net, and our plan for jobs provides programmes like Kickstart alongside record investment in skills so that people can find their first job, their next job or a new job if needed.”"
2021-02-04T05:30:47Z,business,Business,Juukan Gorge traditional owners say they are reluctant to continue dealing with Rio Tinto,"The traditional Aboriginal owners of Juukan Gorge, which mining giant Rio Tinto knowingly destroyed in order to access higher-grade iron ore, say they are reluctant to continue dealing with the company, accusing it of reneging on a key promise it made to rebuild their shattered relationship. In a letter to the company seen by Guardian Australia, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples (PKKP) say they learned of an executive reshuffle only through media reports and accused Rio Tinto of breaking a promise that iron ore boss Ivan Vella would be personally responsible for repairing trust. The PKKP say that for “consistency and balance” they had specifically asked for Vella to work with them, and at a meeting in November this was given “unequivocal” support by the chairman of the Rio Tinto board, Simon Thompson.
“We were thus shocked and surprised to hear via the media on Thursday morning that Mr Vella is being transferred to Montreal and Mr [Simon] Trott will fill the position of CEO Iron Ore, as two of a number of senior management changes,” PKKP Aboriginal corporation’s acting executive, Grant Wilson, wrote in the 2 February letter. Wilson said that after the meeting, many within the PKKP “retained deep-seated skepticism” about whether Rio Tinto was genuine in its desire to restore trust. However, “others in the group who staked much of their own personal credibility on making a case for reconciliation and trust” prevailed, he said. “Through Ivan Vella and team, PKKP believed commitments to progress were beginning, but now PKKP is left to consider how it will respond to this latest in many disappointments, and whether trust in Rio Tinto can ever be realised. “PKKP is reluctant to participate in a relationship of this nature any longer, and I hope you understand that other stakeholders may take a similar approach.” Rio Tinto’s destruction of the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia in May 2020 caused international furore, prompted a federal parliamentary inquiry and saw the removal of three top executives, including the global boss, Jean Sebastien-Jaques. Last week Rio Tinto’s board announced a new executive structure – which Aboriginal native title groups described as “PR spin” they were not confident would lead to “meaningful change”. When contacted by Guardian Australia, the PKKP Aboriginal corporation said it had been in contact with Rio Tinto recently but “would not comment on the specific nature of any correspondence or discussions”. Rio Tinto says rebuilding the relationship with the PKKP remains a priority. A company spokesperson said: “We value an honest and open dialogue with the PKKP as this is critical to all enduring relationships. Rightly, the relationship with all traditional owners in the Pilbara, including the PKKP, is led by the chief executive of the iron ore business. We are confident that ongoing engagement with the PKKP will help maintain the momentum built over recent months.”
But the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility accused Rio Tinto of making an “elementary and entirely avoidable blunder”, which the PKKP could reasonably see as evidence that “the company still views its relationship with traditional owners as an afterthought”. “Thompson has just personally made the task of restoring trust and good relations with the PKKP much harder for responsible Rio Tinto staff,” the centre’s general counsel, James Fitzgerald, said. “Sadly, it now appears to fall on the PKKP themselves to deliver a masterclass in respect and good community relations practice to the company’s top leadership. Meanwhile, Indigenous groups around the world watch on with interest.” The $52bn superannuation fund Hesta, which has been a leading critic of the company among institutional investors, said last week that the reshuffle could help the company change its governance and culture. “Companies that fail to negotiate fairly and in good faith with Indigenous communities represent a clear systemic risk to investors,” Hesta’s chief executive, Debby Blakey, said. Rio’s progress on improving its governance and culture would “inform our share voting at Rio’s AGM in May”, Blakey said."

In fact, he is merely dropping one of his three job titles at thee online retailer. He will no longer be chief executive but will still be executive chairman. And, since he didn’t mention his status as “president” (whatever that involves), one assumes Bezos is keeping that bauble. This “transition”, including the promotion of its web services boss Andy Jassy to be chief executive from the autumn, has been greeted as a very big deal. Let’s see. Its significance depends on how Bezos plays things. He gets formal leave to spend more time on other interests – everything from the Washington Post to rockets – but he was probably doing so informally anyway. Real change at Amazon may be hard to detect. As chairman, Bezos will still run the board. And as the most senior executive (still), he has freedom to roam wherever he wishes. If Bezos and Jassy disagree, everybody knows who will prevail. It will be the bloke who also owns 10% of the shares. By not being chief executive, it becomes easier for Bezos to avoid the next grilling in front of US lawmakers over Amazon’s treatment of small businesses, workers (note this week’s $61.7m [£45m] settlement of claims the company pocketed delivery drivers’ tips) or anti-trust issues. He usually performs awkwardly on such occasions, so it’ll suit both him and Amazon if he’s not on parade. But that doesn’t mean Bezos won’t be making the big corporate decisions. “Jeff is really not going anywhere,” conceded Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer. Quite. GlaxoSmithKline injects vaccine urgency, finally The Covid vaccine tortoise, as Citigroup’s analyst described GlaxoSmithKline, is stirring. The group has signed a deal with CureVac to produce 100m doses of the US biotech firm’s current vaccine candidate. Then the pair will work on tackling virus variants, with results promised for 2022. Good stuff – and about time too, some might say. The tortoise jibe is not wholly fair since it is not GSK’s fault that its Covid efforts with Sanofi of France hit delays; that can happen. But it is certainly true that GSK has been eclipsed by AstraZeneca, in partnership with Oxford University, on Covid. Being outpaced by AstraZeneca will feel familiar for GSK investors for other reasons. You’ve more than doubled your money if you bought AstraZeneca shares when Pascal Soriot became chief executive in 2012. GSK, by contrast, has been a tale of false dawns. The shares reached £18.50 in January 2020 on hopes that its chief executive Emma Walmsley’s revitalisation plan marked a turning point; now they’ve dipped below £13, down 6% on Wednesday. The full-year numbers for 2020 provided a flavour of why. Nothing has obviously gone wrong under Walmsley, but nor is there much to get excited about. The dividend will be cut when the big corporate re-jig - the demerger of the consumer products division – happens next year, but the distribution has looked unsustainable for ages. Until Walmsley gives the full divi details in June, though, investors are in the dark. In the meantime, this year’s earnings will fall by a “mid to high single digit percentage”, slightly worse than feared. A significant number of Americans, it seems, will have to delay their GSK shingles jabs in order to get their Covid ones. Better days are still promised for the long-term, which is perhaps the main point. There are 10 potential “blockbusters” in the late-stage pharma pipeline, said Walmsley. Investors might feel more bullish when a few appear, which is always the challenge with pharma turnarounds. AstraZeneca, remember, spent years in hibernation until Soriot’s back-the-scientists strategy came good. For a little while yet, Walmsley deserves the benefit of the doubt. Asda buyers robustly get down to leverage “We are putting in place a robust capital structure,” say the Issa brothers about the financing of their £6.8bn purchase of Asda. Really? Compared to what? This is a private equity-backed deal and it shows. Asda’s petrol stations are being sold (to the Issas’ EG Group inevitably), a chunk of the warehouses will be off-loaded via sale-and-leaseback deals and £3.5bn ($4.7bn) of debt is being injected into the mix. Demand for warehouses is strong and corporate debt markets are full of buyers, so the financial plan should find financiers. Come on, though, this is an old-fashioned leverage buyout. It looks like Asda will be approximately four times leveraged as a ratio of top-line earnings. Call that robust if you wish. Others would describe it as racy in a supermarket sector that has three strong – and more conservatively-financed – competitors."
2021-02-03T17:36:43Z,business,Business,"KPMG pays UK partners average of Â£572,000 each","The accounting giant KPMG has paid its 582 UK partners an average of £572,000 each in the middle of the Covid crisis. Thesubstantial payouts are just 11% lower than the £640,000 average pay for each partner in 2019. KPMG’s UK chairman, Bill Michael, collected £1.7m, down 14% from the near-£2m he was granted a year earlier. The pay cuts came as the firm revealed a 6% drop in annual underlying profits to £288m, saying it suffered weaker demand for consulting and advisory services at the start of the pandemic. KPMG said the pay cuts were necessary to “protect jobs and support employees.”
The High Pay Centre thinktank said remuneration levels at KPMG were still extreme when compared with the salaries of regular UK workers, particularly those who faced financial hardship during the Covid outbreak. “While it is welcome that KPMG have cut pay for their partners, the scale of these packages are still unimaginably high for the vast majority of British people, many of whom would have to work decades to earn these sums,” said Andrew Speke, a spokesman for the High Pay Centre. “Given the hardships many people have faced this year and warnings from the chancellor of tough days ahead, we hope that KPMG will use these cuts to ensure the incomes of staff on lower salaries are protected,” he added. The rival accountancy firm BDO came under fire in December for paying its 264 partners an average of £518,000 each, while refusing to repay £4.5m in furlough money that it said kept 700 staff on its payroll. BDO’s managing partner, Paul Eagland, said there had been a “moral debate” about returning the furlough cash, but decided there was a greater responsibility to protect jobs. However, it did a U-turn just days later, after being widely criticised and “recognising the public mood”. KPMG is one of the so-called big four accounting giants, and the other three have also continued to hand out huge pay packets, even after cuts. In October, Deloitte, said partners would be handed an average £731,000 for 2020, despite cutting pay by 17%. EY only shaved 1.8% of average pay to £667,000, and PwC’s partners took home £685,000 after a 10% cut. KPMG UK said it had not furloughed any staff or tapped government Covid loans during the crisis. However, it did cut 200 jobs at the start of the pandemic due to a drop in demand for its consulting and advising services. The firm, which had 15,776 staff as of October, has since launched a recruitment drive, taking on 900 graduates and apprentices and 950 other “experienced hires” following a pick-up in business. Michael said: “Our first quarter’s performance has been positive and our sales pipeline is strong. The [merger and acquisition] market has resurged, and clients are resuming discretionary projects as they adapt to the changes the pandemic has brought both to their business and market.”"
2021-02-03T16:35:46Z,business,Business,De Beers diamond sales surge after Christmas jewellery rush in US,"De Beers has revealed its strongest diamond sales in three years following a Christmas surge in jewellery purchases, with sales 10% above the group’s 20-year average. The world’s biggest diamond miner made $650m from its rough stones last month, well above sales of $551m in early 2020, amounting to the highest sales since January 2018. Sales were propelled thanks to a busy Christmas season for jewellery buying in the US, and the company hopes for a diamond rush over the Chinese New Year and Valentine’s Day. The Covid-19 pandemic had initially led to a collapse in demand for stones as many jewellery makers and stores were obliged to shut down. Bruce Cleaver, chief executive at De Beers Group, said midstream diamond buyers - who transform the rough stones into polished diamonds - had begun to restock so were prepared to fulfil new orders from retailers. Although the diamond industry still faced “risks to recovery”, due to Covid-19 rules restricting movement of people and goods, Cleaver said he was encouraged by the increase in demand. De Beers reportedly called for one of the steepest increases in diamond prices in almost 10 years last month, when it raised the price for stones larger than one carat. The company does not reveal what it charges buyers, but is understood to have increased the price of its stones by up to 5% in the January sales round, according to a report by Bloomberg, which cited unnamed sources. This increase, which is understood to apply to stones bigger than one carat, would be one of the steepest hikes since the early part of the last decade, according to the report. The stronger sales and higher prices could signal a change in fortune for the business, which has been part of the Anglo American mining conglomerate since 2012. Sales of De Beers’ diamonds slumped by a third in 2020 to hit their lowest level in almost 10 years as the pandemic took the shine off global demand for diamonds and gems. The company said it had provisionally sold $2.7bn (£1.9bn) of rough diamonds last year, down sharply from sales of more than $4bn in 2019. There was a glimmer of recovery in its figures for the final diamond sales cycle of last year, when earnings climbed to a provisional figure of $440m in December, up slightly higher than during the same period last year."
2021-02-03T16:30:10Z,business,Business,Australia's housing market is boosted by policies designed to ensure prices keep rising | Greg Jericho,"The latest housing loan figures show Australia’s housing market continues on its merry way. The market is still boosted by government policies designed to ensure prices keep rising, even in an environment where wages are unlikely to grow and interest rates look unlikely to rise significantly for many years. In 2020 Australian homebuyers and investors took out a total of $246.3bn worth of new housing loans – the third most ever recorded in a calendar year behind 2017 and 2015 – not bad for a year that also saw a recession for the first time in nearly 30 years:
I must admit at the start of the pandemic to being a bit concerned that house prices might fall. I should apologise for my naivety in thinking the government would ever let such a thing happen. If there is one thing you can count on in politics it is that a Coalition government (and to be honest an ALP one as well) will look after homeowners.
And so after a record 11% fall in May, the homebuilder grant and other policies designed to keep the housing market going in the opposite direction to the rest of the economy has seen the value of housing loans increase in seven consecutive months:
The story remains all about owner-occupiers. In December a record $19.9bn in owner-occupier home loans was taken out – some 37% above the pre-pandemic peak; while the amount of new investor finance in December was 33% below the peak of January 2017:
Overall housing finance in December was 31% above where it was 12 months earlier, and this suggests that house prices around the country are set to rise faster than they have any time in the past decade:
The big surge has occurred out west. Total housing finance in Western Australia was a jaw-dropping 83% higher than 12 months ago, with owner-occupier loans up 87%:
Given that the Perth housing market has been in the doldrums for most of the past six years, it would seem a price boom is going to happen:
It is clear that the increase in home loans across the nation is being driven by the two factors: the first is the government stimulus through the homebuilder program that has led to record numbers of home loans for construction of houses and also homebuilding approvals:
The second factor is the record low interest rates, which the governor of the Reserve Bank suggested on Wednesday would likely remain in place until at least 2024. The reason Philip Lowe believes this is: for rates to again rise, first inflation needs to grow “sustainably” within the 2% to 3%. For that to happen, wages would need to at least grow that fast – and nearer to 3% than 2%. That really hasn’t happened for the entire time the Coalition has been in government since 2013. For now, the Reserve Bank is not worried about house prices rising too fast. Lowe told the press club that “there’s a lot of focus at the moment on the fact that housing prices are rising again ... but the national house price index today is where it was four years ago”. He argued this demonstrated that “we’ve had no net increase in national housing prices over the past four years and the capital city price index is lower than four years ago”. That is true as far as it goes, but mainly because the capital city index is dominated by the Sydney market. In reality last September, Brisbane, Hobart, Adelaide and Canberra recorded the highest level on the residential price index:
The RBA is more concerned about unsustainable lending than just housing price rises – and suggests there are no real signs of that occurring at this stage. But still, it is rather telling that in the midst of a pandemic and recession there are concerns about house prices growing too fast; for there sure as heck are no such concerns about wages growing in such a manner."

2021-02-03T15:48:31Z,business,Business,Enter the Draghi: can 'Super Mario' save Italy as he did the euro?,"“Whatever it takes.” Three simple words that tamed the financial markets, saved the euro from possible collapse and turned Mario Draghi from an Italian technocrat into the central banker of his generation. And an obvious choice to head a new coalition government in Rome at a time when the country is facing the triple whammy of Covid-19, economic collapse and political chaos. Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, was desperate to appoint someone with the authority to lead the country out of deep recession and counter the euro-scepticism of parties of the right, and who better than “Super Mario”, the man who dug the single currency out of a deep hole in 2012? The venue was London, just ahead of the Olympic Games. The occasion was a financial conference organised by Mervyn King, then governor of the Bank of England. The backdrop was speculative attacks on Italian and Spanish bonds that put the very survival of the single currency in doubt. Central bankers rarely deliver memorable soundbites. Some – such as Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve – have actually thought it a good idea to leave the markets guessing by being as cryptic as possible. But this was an existential crisis for the euro and Draghi – only recently installed as president of the European Central Bank (ECB) – knew it was a time for clarity not obfuscation. Having told the speculators that they underestimated the political capital that had been invested in monetary union, Draghi continued: “Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough.” The markets got the message: if they wanted to carry on selling Italian and Spanish bonds they would have to take on the ECB and its considerable firepower. Few were prepared to take that risk and even before the Frankfurt-based bank had bought a single bond the pressure on the governments in Rome and Madrid eased. Draghi has had a long and varied career. Born in the postwar Italy of the 1940s, he was an academic, worked for the World Bank, and the Italian treasury before leaving for a job in the private sector with Goldman Sachs in 2001. After four years, he became governor of the Bank of Italy and was appointed to run the ECB in 2011. Those who thought Draghi would be only a figurehead at the ECB, with the real decisions being made by Germany and its allies in northern Europe, were quickly proved wrong. A central bank that had traditionally been slow moving and rigid in its thinking under his predecessor Jean-Claude Trichet, became much more interventionist and innovative. The ECB embraced quantitative easing (QE): the money creation programme that involves the central bank creating money through purchases of bonds. When Draghi thought the eurozone economy was still not receiving sufficient stimulus, he argued successfully for the ECB to push one of its key interest rates into negative territory – the first major central bank to do so. Germany voiced misgivings but could not prevent Draghi from having his own way. The ECB president proved to be a political operator as well as a skilled communicator. During his time in Frankfurt, Draghi regularly insisted that the ECB could not cure all the problems of the eurozone through low interest rates and QE, and that it was up to national governments to make more use of tax and spending to boost growth. He now has to use his experience and credibility to sort out the problems of an economy that – after a disastrous 2020 – is barely bigger than it was in 1999."
2021-02-03T15:40:03Z,business,Business,"UK should respond to economic crisis with 1945-style reboot, says CBI chief","Britain needs an economic strategy for the next decade to match the ambition of the 1945 postwar recovery as the country emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic, the new head of the CBI said. In his first keynote speech as director general of the business group, Tony Danker said the “triple shocks” of Brexit, coronavirus and climate change highlighted the need for business and government to work together on a long-term plan. Invoking the work of the 1945 Labour government to reboot Britain’s economy from the devastation of the second world war, and contrasting it with the response to the 2008 financial crisis, he said the government, businesses and trade unions needed to work together on a fightback plan. “I believe we must, and we will, come together to forge a better decade. More 1945 than 2008,” he said. Danker, head of the country’s most powerful business lobby group, replaced Dame Carolyn Fairbairn in the role late last year. Previously he was chief executive of Be the Business, a government and industry-funded organisation launched by George Osborne with the aim of boosting British companies’ productivity. Formerly he had been chief strategy officer at Guardian News and Media, the publisher of the Guardian and Observer. Saying the UK had failed to “build back better” from the 2008 banking crisis, Danker warned that productivity and economic growth had flatlined while the UK had become a more divided nation. This time around he said “vision, a plan and a consensus as a nation to pursue it” was needed to rebuild a fairer, greener, economy for the 2020s.
Highlighting the creation of the welfare state and the birth of the NHS after the war as a moment when “real shifts for the better” had taken place, he added: “Let’s be clear. The scale of the shocks we’re facing today – Brexit, Covid, and the climate imperative – demand a similarly dramatic moment of unity and foresight. So, what will we take from this crisis? Where, in our darkest times, have we made real shifts for the better? Most notably, of course, in the aftermath of the second world war, when postwar reconstruction gave birth to the NHS and creation of the welfare state.” Danker’s first speech in charge of the CBI came as Boris Johnson’s government drew up plans for easing coronavirus restrictions this spring and rebooting the economy from the deepest recession in more than 300 years. Business leaders and unions have called for the furlough scheme to be extended until at least the summer in response to the damage inflicted by the Covid shock to build up sustainable recovery. Warning against a full embrace of free-market ideology, he said a middle ground between big government and neoliberalism could be forged. “For decades we’ve oscillated between the view that either government should run the economy, or that government should just stay out of it,” he said. Urging the government to invest in a green economic recovery, he said a national economic vision for overcoming political cycles could be created. “We have been short term, both sides, and failed to unite around a shared plan to realise our potential. History will judge how we used this moment to map the path to get to 2030.”"
2021-02-03T15:20:15Z,business,Business,Asda buyers aim to spin off petrol forecourts in £750m deal,"The buyers of Asda have announced plans to sell off its petrol forecourts and distribution centres to help fund a £6.8bn takeover. The private equity firm TDR Capital and the billionaire Issa brothers aim to raise £950m from the sale of Asda’s distribution centres, which will then be leased back, while the group’s petrol stations will be bought by the brothers’ own EG Group for £750m.
Mohsin and Zuber Issa leased their first petrol station in 1999 and today have more than 6,000 across 10 countries. It is not clear whether EG will pay Asda for use of its name on the petrol forecourts. Financing for the Asda takeover, which is awaiting approval from the competition watchdog, will also include £3.5bn of new debt, made up of bonds and an €850m (£749m) loan. The expected proceeds from the sale of the petrol stations and distribution centres will be used to pay off two additional bridging loans being taken on to finance the takeover. The plan will saddle Asda with debts equivalent to about four times its earnings of £1.2bn – giving it more than double the burden of its major supermarket rivals. The level of debt is likely to raise concerns, particularly as the Issa brothers’ EG Group has funded its rapid expansion by loans. Last year’s accounts showed a debt pile of about £7bn. Clive Black, a retail analyst at the city broker Shore Capital, said: “The risk profile of Asda has undoubtedly gone up.” He said the need to service additional debt and pay rents on the distribution centres alongside the sale of petrol forecourts, which are beneficial to cashflow, would all place extra pressure on Asda’s finances. “They have bought Asda when supermarkets have got elevated sales and brighter general prospects as working from home and online groceries are probably here to stay. There is lots of money around and it is very cheap for risk-taking entrepreneurs and private equity but only time will tell whether they will look back and think that was a good thing to do.” TDR and the Issas are putting up £780m of cash, while Walmart, the current owner of Asda, will contribute £500m of equity to retain a minority stake in its UK arm. The potential new owners have also committed to invest £1bn in the company, although it is understood this will be funded from Asda’s resources and will not be new cash. The supermarket’s chief executive, Roger Burnley, will continue to run the chain after the acquisition. Mohsin and Zuber Issa said they were putting in place a “robust capital structure” to support their growth strategy for the company and were “confident that external investors will share our belief in Asda’s strong fundamentals and exciting future prospects”. Sale and leaseback deals have proved problematic for retailers as they can tie them to long rental agreements that can prove onerous if stores need to be updated or exited.
The Issas said: “Asda is an iconic British business that we have known and loved since we were children. We are proud to bring its ownership back to the UK and delighted that, with the support of TDR Capital and Walmart, we can invest in its future. “Local control means that strategic decisions will be more closely aligned with colleagues, customers and communities. We are putting in place a robust capital structure … and we are confident that external investors will share our belief in Asda’s strong fundamentals and exciting future prospects.” The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering whether the acquisition will lead to a “substantial lessening of competition” in the UK. The CMA must make a decision by 18 February on whether the deal should be subject to a more in-depth inquiry. Last year the CMA blocked an audacious attempt to merge Asda with its larger rival Sainsbury’s, which would have created a new market leader."
2021-02-03T10:00:02Z,business,Business,Second-hand clothing mountain piles up as Brexit halts exports to EU,"A mountain of used goods is building up in the north-east of England as one of the biggest exporters of second-hand clothing to the EU has suffered a breakdown in trade caused by Brexit. Since January, exports to the EU from ECS Textiles in North Shields have ground to a halt due to border delays, piles of paperwork and confusion over post-Brexit rules, costing charities thousands of pounds in lost donations each week. ECS would normally send five 20-tonne container loads by sea to Latvia each week, full of second-hand clothes, toys, furniture and bric-a-brac for resale in eastern Europe. However, its deliveries have failed to get through since the end of the Brexit, with one container stuck in the port of the Latvian capital, Riga, incurring charges and threatened with import tariffs usually reserved for Chinese goods. James Officer, sales manager at ECS Textiles, said the backlogs meant its warehouse was full to the brim with donated clothing that could not be shipped. “We’re at capacity. It could essentially close the business because we have no more physical room and it’s a really big worry. We’ve got containers sat in port, we’re paying standing charges, our customers can’t have their goods, and we’re not being paid. The business has ground to a halt.”
One month since the Brexit trade deal came into force, problems and delays caused by additional paperwork, border checks and red tape are causing major disruption for UK businesses. Boris Johnson described the issues as “teething problems”, however growing numbers of firms are warning the additional costs and delays are a permanent business hurdle. ECS Textiles, with a turnover of about £2m per year and hubs across the UK, collects clothes and bric-a-brac from charity shops and homes and resells these items to the continent, raising thousands of pounds per week for good causes including veterans’ charities, animal welfare and the NHS. Officer said one animal charity would normally receive £5,000 per week, but it was only able to pay £1,000 because of Brexit-induced delays.
The company has fallen foul of rules of origin requirements. UK goods are eligible for zero-tariff sales in the EU. But because most of the goods ECS is exporting were produced in China, port authorities in Latvia are threatening to charge 5.3% tariffs – or border taxes. The charge would eviscerate the profits required to keep the company running and raising funds for charity. ECS says the work done to sort and grade the items it exports should allow them to qualify as British. Although the firm has had support from the local chamber of commerce, Officer said the UK government had not helped it to obtain a rule of origin certificate to let it keep trading with the EU. “That 5.3% on every container will dramatically reduce the amount we can donate to charities that we’ve collected on behalf of, and that’s a real worry.”"
2021-02-03T09:41:41Z,business,Business,FTSE 100 firms have no black executives in top three roles,"There are no black executives in any of the top three roles at Britain’s 100 biggest companies for the first time in six years, according to a report on boardroom diversity. Annual research from the executive recruitment and diversity consultancy agency Green Park shows that the number of black leaders at FTSE 100 firms has stalled since it first reported in 2014 and has now dropped to zero. The cruise operator Carnival, which is run by a black chief executive, Arnold Donald, dropped out of the FTSE 100 last summer, and the South African businessman Fred Phaswana has retired as the joint chair of the packaging and paper group Mondi. Overall, the number of people from most other minority ethnic backgrounds who hold the role of chair, chief executive or chief financial officer has increased by a small amount in that period. But the lack of black executives means that only 10 out of 297 leaders (3.4%) in these top three positions have ethnic minority backgrounds, the same proportion as when Green Park first began its analysis of FTSE firms in 2014.
However, the report found that black representation at the top of British businesses looked unlikely to improve in the near future, with the number of people in the leadership pipeline also decreasing, from 1.4% to 0.9%. This means it is unlikely that the FTSE will meet the government-backed target, set by Sir John Parker in his 2016 review, of bringing an end to all-white boards by the end of this year. Trevor Phillips, the chair of Green Park and the former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said: “We know there is no shortage of qualified candidates to fill these roles if companies are willing to look. Yet the snowy peaks of British business remain stubbornly white.” Phillips said the lack of black leaders at Britain’s biggest businesses made talented black employees think they would not be able to advance there in their careers, looking instead to smaller companies, or the US.
Phillips called on shareholders, consumers and employees to “start questioning whether black lives matter is just rhetoric rather than reality. Corporate leaders need to stop telling us how much they care and do something to show us that black lives really do matter.” Green Park is calling for organisations to act to tackle issues surrounding race inequality, for a fairer society and to ensure the success of British business after Brexit."
2021-02-03T09:34:51Z,business,Business,Ryanair 'jab and go' TV ad banned for encouraging Covid risk-taking,"The UK’s advertising watchdog has banned Ryanair’s controversial “jab and go” holiday TV campaign, saying it encouraged the public to act irresponsibly once they have received a coronavirus vaccination shot. The Advertising Standards Authority’s decision to ban the two TV ads, which have become the third most complained-about campaign of all time, comes days after the Ryanair chief executive, Michael O’Leary, said the vaccine programme would allow British families to flock to Europe for summer holidays this year. The ad campaign, which featured a small bottle labelled “vaccine” and a syringe, encouraged the public to snap up bargain deals to sunny European destinations such as Spain and Greece because “you could jab and go”. Launched on Boxing Day, the ad said “Covid vaccines are coming so book your Easter and summer holidays today with Ryanair”. The ads showed groups in their 20s and 30s engaged in activities such as jumping in a pool and being served at a restaurant, with no social distancing or use of face coverings. The campaign struck a nerve with the public, prompting 2,370 complaints to the ASA. Some complainants said it was misleading to suggest most people would be vaccinated by spring or summer and so be able to go abroad, and that being vaccinated meant no restrictions would be in place. Others said it was irresponsible because it encouraged people to believe that once they had even the first vaccination shot they would not need follow health restrictions. Ryanair said the assertions made in the ads were not out of step with government goals, and that they were designed to be “uplifting and encourage viewers to consider a brighter future”. The airline told the ASA that the ads showed people “holidaying in their social bubble” and that there were “no requirements that holidaymakers be shown wearing face masks or social distancing”. The ASA ruled that the ads broke the UK ad rules relating to misleading and irresponsible advertising. “We considered some viewers were likely to infer that by Easter and summer 2021 it would be possible for anyone to get vaccinated in order to go on a booked holiday, that maximal protection could be achieved immediately through one dose of the vaccine, and that restrictions around social distancing and mask wearing would not be necessary once individuals were vaccinated,” the ASA said in its ruling. “We considered this could encourage vaccinated individuals to disregard or lessen their adherence to restrictions, which in the short term could expose them to the risk of serious illness, and in the longer term might result in them spreading the virus. As such we considered the ads could encourage people to behave irresponsibly once vaccinated. The ads must not be broadcast again.” Ryanair said that while it would comply with the ad ban it believed the ASA’s decision was at odds with the success of the government’s vaccination programme.
“The ASA’s ruling flies in the face of the UK’s successful vaccine rollout,” said a spokesman. “However, even though this ruling is baseless, Ryanair will comply with it and the jab and go adverts will not run again.” A national newspaper ad by Paddy Power that promised losing punters their money back if South African athlete Oscar Pistorius was acquitted of allegedly killing his girlfriend is the most-complained about UK ad of all time, attracting 5,525 complaints and a ban. Travel company Booking.com is responsible for the second-most complained about ad, which substituted the word “booking” for a well known swearword. The TV and cinema ad prompted 2,451 complaints that it encouraged foul language. The ASA dismissed the complaints saying it was a lighthearted play on words and viewers were likely to have picked up the swearword elsewhere."
2021-02-03T06:00:52Z,business,Business,The UK's Covid-19 unemployment crisis in six charts,"The number of people being made redundant in the UK is rising at the fastest pace on record as the second wave of Covid-19 and tougher lockdown measures put increasing pressure on businesses and workers. Unemployment has hit the highest level for four years, while millions more workers have been placed on furlough. Although the jobs crisis has not been as bad as feared earlier in the pandemic, the government’s independent economics forecaster – the Office for Budget Responsibility – expects the jobless rate to more than double from pre-pandemic levels to 7.5% this summer after furlough ends, representing more than 2.6 million people out of work. Here are the key charts for the UK jobs outlook in 2021.
The latest official figures for unemployment from the Office for National Statistics cover the three months to November 2020. Reflecting the jobs market during the second English lockdown and as tough restrictions were imposed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the data shows unemployment reached 5% – representing more than 1.7 million people. Unemployment was 4% in February before the pandemic struck. There are some promising signs, including a slowdown in redundancy rates. Economists believe unemployment would be far higher without furlough, while joblessness on a par with the 1980s of about 12% – forecast early in the pandemic – has so far been avoided.
Younger workers are bearing the brunt of the jobs crisis inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic. This is largely because they tend to work in sectors of the economy that have suffered most from physical-distancing restrictions and shutdowns – such as retail, hospitality and leisure. Low-paid staff, and workers from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds have also suffered a disproportionate impact, stoking fears that a lasting legacy of the crisis will be to entrench inequalities.
Preventing a shaper rise in unemployment during the pandemic, the government’s furlough scheme has topped up the wages of almost 10 million workers at more than 1.2m companies since the crisis began. The number of people on furlough hit a peak of almost 9 million in May during the first lockdown, and gradually fell as the economy reopened last summer. However, at its intended closure date in October, more than 2 million workers were still receiving support. Their numbers swelled further during renewed lockdowns after the scheme was extended, reaching almost 4 million by the end of 2020. The scheme, now due to run until the end of April, has cost the Treasury almost £50bn so far. Billions more has been spent subsidising lost income for self-employed workers, but millions of people have fallen through the cracks and received no emergency Covid support.
The impact of the pandemic has been felt most by companies and workers in the hospitality, leisure, arts and entertainment sectors, as well as in travel and retail, where physical distancing and the shift to online sales during the crisis has cost thousands of workers their jobs.
The fallout from rising job losses and a sharp drop in income from work for UK households has been a surge in the numbers of people claiming unemployment-related benefits. The government increased the value of universal credit benefits by £20 a week at the start of the crisis, but this is temporary and due to be cut again from the end of March. Charities have warned this would trigger a sharp rise in poverty levels across Britain.
Britain’s economy has been plunged into the deepest recession for more than 300 years by the crisis. With repeat lockdowns, a lack of clarity about the future and continued Covid restrictions, fewer companies are advertising to hire new staff. There have been reports of hundreds of people applying for single job openings, including almost 1,000 for a receptionist job in a Manchester diner. Job vacancies have started to recover, but remain scarcer than before the pandemic."
2021-02-03T06:00:51Z,business,Business,'We want to be busy': Tottenham battles Covid-19 recession,"The streets of north London around the Tottenham Hotspur stadium are quiet. In the shadow of the gargantuan building, as though descended from space on the Tottenham High Road, business has dried up for Ali Polmaz, who runs the Spurs Restaurant kebab shop. “It has killed us,” he said, sharpening his blade to carve doner kebab for a rare lunchtime takeaway customer. “We still have to pay rent; the landlord told me this is his only income. We want to be busy, but with no fans there is no business.” Far from a hive of activity, the 62,850-seater stadium – expected to be a beacon of regeneration when it opened in 2019 – stands as a silent monument to Britain’s frozen economy amid the Covid pandemic. The impact has been disproportionately felt in this part of London: Haringey – the borough with Tottenham at its heart – has the fastest growing rate of unemployment in the country.
After UK unemployment hit the highest level in four years nationwide last week, the number of people claiming jobless benefits here has surged by 7.7% in the year to December – more than double the national average. About 11.3% of the local population are now receiving support from jobseeker’s allowance or universal credit, compared with the 6.3% UK average. The number of people on furlough is also among the highest nationally, as the jobs crisis engulfing Britain claims Tottenham as its epicentre.
A giant silver monolith built alongside Spurs’ historic White Hart Lane stadium, the new £1.2bn ground had been supporting 4,000 jobs in the area before crowds were banned last March in the fight against Covid; boosting employment in restaurants, bars and the wider community of shops, pubs and cafes. But the Covid recession has hit hospitality and leisure harder than any other sector of the economy, with more than a third of the sector’s workers across the country now furloughed, and many thousands more losing their jobs. To help it stay afloat, Spurs, one of the richest clubs in world football, borrowed £175m from the Bank of England last year. But without crowds piling in to watch the Premier League, American football and concerts – at a time when the economy is in the deepest recession for 300 years – the club scored a £64m loss for the year to June. Paolo Povoas had been hired to work at Spurs’ stadium last March. But his first match day – a fixture against Manchester United – was among the first league games cancelled as the pandemic hit, leaving the 18-year-old out of work with no prospect of employment.
After rejection by JD Sports and several other attempts to find work in retail, he found a job at Amazon’s nearby Enfield warehouse with help from Jordan Mattis, a job coach from the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation, which helps people in the local area to find work. “I was trying to apply for jobs but wasn’t successful. So many jobs weren’t accepting due to lockdown. When I finally started, I was happy just to know I was doing something and getting paid as well,” he said. The scale of the jobs crisis in the area dawned on David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary and Tottenham’s Labour MP, in early April last year as queues outside food banks ballooned. “I couldn’t believe it. The queues of people, and the profile who were struggling to feed their children. It was the ordinary face of London. “I’ve heard some commentators talking about unemployment that harks back to the 1980s, but actually I think this is way more significant.”
Tottenham had its fair share of problems before the pandemic struck. With deprivation levels among the highest in the country, it was at the heart of the 2011 London riots; triggered after the police shooting of Mark Duggan, and fuelled by a deep sense of inequality and injustice. But despite lower pay levels, issues with education and affordable housing, its proximity to central London provided opportunities for work. This time, however, it is that proximity that is the central problem, as London’s economy collapses during the crisis. The lack of crowds down Tottenham High Road might be problematic for many, but the ghost town just 10 minutes away on the Victoria Line – usually a hub for employment – is an even bigger cause of concern for Haringey residents.
Haringey has a larger share of workers in low-income jobs in those sectors of the economy hardest-hit by physical-distancing; as cleaners in Canary Wharf, baristas in City coffee shops, Uber drivers and Deliveroo riders, or as staff in the closed shops and restaurants of the West End. While employment was higher than in similarly poor parts of Britain thanks to these opportunities before the pandemic, much was in lower-paid and precarious work that quickly vanished. “It’s clear when you think about it, with the city effectively shut down,” said Lammy. “You realise that it’s the lion’s share of a community like mine, and it’s not surprising then that it’s BAME people, and also women and lone parents, who are unemployed or furloughed.” Less than a year ago Haringey did not even rank within the 50 local authorities in Britain with high claimant counts. Now it sits second, just behind Blackpool where unemployment was already twice the national average before Covid hit. Of the 10 areas where unemployment is rising fastest, all are London boroughs in predominantly poorer parts of the capital.
Councillor Joseph Ejiofor, the Labour leader of Haringey council, said the borough was trying hard to help residents find work through virtual Zoom job coaching sessions and other programmes, but £280m has been cut from its budget since 2010 under the Conservative government’s austerity drive. The fastest growth in benefit claims – albeit from a low base – is in the typically more affluent area of Muswell Hill, popular with actors, musicians, media and creative industry workers. Ejiofor said these two sides of Haringey, separated by the hills around Crouch End and the railway running north from King’s Cross, which serve as a geographic barrier to the socioeconomic split – were a microcosm of the country’s problems at large. Both are suffering, but from different starting points. “There is a real concern about where we go when furlough ends,” he said. “Part of the problem is the government talking about levelling up, they think London is homogeneous and there aren’t any issues. But we’ve got to deal with issues between the east and west of our own borough.”
The jobs crisis comes at a delicate moment for the capital, as its former mayor, Boris Johnson, promises investment in the north and Midlands to meet the “levelling-up” campaign promise that cemented his election landslide in 2019. While towns and cities outside the south-east entered the crisis in a worse position, Covid has hit London harder, fuelled by its dense population and higher proportion of office employees working from home. With travel, hospitality and retail jobs hardest hit, the blend of Covid and Brexit means London’s population is forecast to decline for the first time since the 1980s. Mark Kleinman, professor of public policy at King’s College London, said the capital could still bounce back as the vaccine allows a gradual return to normality. But the early evidence is worrying. “My kind of gut feeling is the long-term strengths of the London economy are still in place. That’s about connectivity, a highly talented labour force, the institutions and the history and its reputation. But there will be quite a lot of adjustment going on.” “There’s no question the impact is very severe in London. And that is being lost in the wider story about levelling up.”"
2021-02-02T22:36:36Z,business,Business,Alphabet reports strong fourth quarter after holiday ads rebound,"Google parent company Alphabet had a better-than-expected fourth quarter in 2020, the company announced Tuesday, bolstered by a rebound in ad spending during the holiday season. Alphabet stocks were up as much as 7% in after hours trading following the company’s earnings report, which showed it reported record revenue for the second quarter in a row, beating analyst estimates. Revenue for the video, search, and advertising giant rose to $56.9bn in the fourth quarter, from $46.08bn a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $53.13bn, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Google’s advertising business, including YouTube, accounted for 81% of Alphabet’s fourth quarter sales, which rose 23% compared with a year ago. Speaking in a call after earnings were announced, Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said more than 100 million people now stream YouTube from their television sets. “YouTube continues, in our view, to be amazing for brand advertisers,” he said. “Our brand business was hit hard in the early stages of the pandemic, but rebounded in Q3 and into Q4. It really helps advertisers reach a younger audience.” “We now reach more 18 to 49 year olds than all linear TV networks combined,” he added. Alphabet’s success comes despite a number of notable roadblocks. On Monday it was announced Google would pay $2.6m to more than 5,500 employees and past job applicants in a settlement over allegations it discriminated against female engineers and Asians in California and Washington state.
The settlement will barely put at dent in Google or its corporate parent, which generates more than $130bn in annual revenue, but marks the latest legal action in a difficult year for the company. Alphabet in 2020 was served three antitrust-related lawsuits and is facing a nascent unionization effort. Alphabet’s growth had slowed earlier in 2020 amid the pandemic and regulatory uncertainty, but Tuesday’s earnings mark a strong recovery, said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com. “A stay-at-home holiday shopping season and a continuing ad rebound from the beginning of the pandemic has helped Google to post a strong fourth quarter,” Anwar said. “This robust turnaround in business should divert investors’ attention for the time being.” Alphabet disclosed for the first time on Tuesday that its Cloud unit is losing $5.6bn a year. The Cloud disclosure marks a major milestone for the company, which generates more revenue from internet advertising than any company globally. The tech company has faced questions for years over whether it can spin the cash from its advertising business into a newly profitable venture. Cloud functions as Google’s attempt to compete with Amazon, whose AWS cloud services dominate the market, followed closely by Microsoft’s Azure. “While Google has been the leader in search, it has lagged behind Amazon and Microsoft in terms of cloud computing,” said Christopher Rossbach, chief information officer of asset management company J Stern & Co. “These results show that it is growing rapidly and it is fast catching up to become a real third player in this important market.” Alphabet said Google Cloud posted a quarterly operating loss of $1.24bn. Google Cloud sales were $3.83bn, or $13.06bn for the full year, up 46% from 2019. Reuters contributed to this report."

2021-02-02T19:53:01Z,business,Business,"BP's reinvention with renewables is still a long, long way off","BP is “performing while transforming”, according to chief executive Bernard Looney’s new slogan. Well, up to a point. The main transformation in 2020 was in the dividend. It was halved, which was also – roughly – the fate of the share price. In terms of performance, the headline numbers were inevitably awful in the year of lockdown. There was a loss of $5.7bn even on the measure that excluded the big mid-year writedown in the value of the oilfields. But BP’s gas traders also managed to make a mess of the fourth quarter by getting caught out by the weather. In mitigation, it doesn’t snow often in Madrid, but the share price still shed a further 4.5% on Tuesday. The “transforming” mantra really refers, of course, to BP’s ambitions in renewables, one of the key planks of Looney’s plan to make the company a net zero business by 2050. How is the renewable programme going? Well, from a financial reporting point of view, there’s little to say. The renewables assets are currently housed within “other businesses and corporate”, an indication that it’s extremely early days for the greening of BP. The aim is to have 50GW of installed renewable capacity by 2030. Current tally: just 3GW, mostly onshore wind in the US plus solar. The scale of the required reinvention perhaps explains why Looney’s plans have been greeted so far with a shrug by the stock market. At one level, the response is understandable. It’ll be half a decade – minimum – before Looney can provide hard evidence that a relative latecomer in renewables can keep up with nimbler specialists and generate the promised returns on capital of 8-10% from new projects.
But the market’s inertia becomes a concern if it lasts too long. A greener strategy is surely the only credible one for a London-listed oil major in the 2020s. But there will inevitably be upsets along the way, which is why visible buy-in by investors matters. Looney has work to do. GameStop bites back on way down It was fun while it lasted, but the Reddit revolutionaries are discovering that share price movements can also be brutal on the way down. Shares in GameStop, which had travelled from $9 to $450 in the month in January, dipped below $100 during New York trading on Tuesday. AMC and other stocks in the day traders’ universe also fell. “It’s not a loss until it’s realised,” said one poster on WallStreetBets, imploring others to keep the faith. Sadly, paper profits don’t count either. The goal was wide open last week to secure once-in-a-lifetime returns. The smart money probably did exactly that. The inevitable tragedy of this drama is that the latecomers get hurt. An open question is whether go-it-alone traders, acting in loose coordination, will become a permanent force to be reckoned with. Well, hedge funds will surely think twice about entering overcrowded short positions; they made themselves ripe for plucking at GameStop. But the Redditors will also have learned the dangers of being in a crowd that is charging unthinkingly in the other direction. The Reddit army for the next expedition may be smaller.

Look at Moonpig now. It’s still got 64% of its market and, after a storming first day as a public company, it is valued at £1.4bn. WH Smith could do with a slice of that action. It is the bigger company by far in terms of group-wide revenues but its market capitalisation is just £2bn as the previously lucrative global “travel” operation awaits the return of passengers to airports and railway stations. Funky Pigeon has grown, but is still only a fraction of Moonpig’s size. Still, at least Swann’s successors will know what to do: funk up the Pigeon and try to make it a close, rather than distant, second. Indeed, since Swann these days chairs Moonpig, they should see the task as a matter of professional pride."
2021-02-02T19:33:56Z,business,Business,EU rules on some types of shellfish leave UK fishers 'devastated',"Fishers around the UK have been “devastated” by fresh problems with exporting their produce to the EU, after the government admitted that exports of live mussels, oysters, scallops and certain other shellfish would be subject to ongoing restrictions. Those are all classified as “live bivalve molluscs” – a category which also includes cockles and clams. Under longstanding EU rules, catches of live bivalve molluscs from non-EU member states can only be imported without treatment if they come from waters deemed of the highest quality. Vessels from non-EU states also cannot land live bivalve molluscs in EU ports. These rules have closed off many exports of live bivalve molluscs from the UK, since Brexit took full effect. The market for such shellfish is a small and specialist one, valued at less than £12m a year, but for the small number of fishers who operate in it, it is often their main livelihood. Other shellfish, such as langoustines, crab and lobster, which are of much greater economic importance, are not affected by these rules. After Brexit, UK fishers are already facing widespread problems exporting their catch. The rules, and the disruption their enforcement has caused for fishers, first reported on the PoliticsHome website, cannot be termed a “teething problem” as other red tape has been, because they will apply permanently under Brexit unless the government can forge a fresh agreement with the EU to make exceptions for UK produce. The fishing industry called on the government to do more to try to resolve the problem. Barrie Deas, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, said: “This is devastating for those involved, and it cannot be left as a closed issue. Those of our members who produce mussels and cockles in particular are affected and are very seriously impacted – no exports to the EU as the UK is now a third country. This has to be sorted at government-to-government level and our understanding is that talks are under way, but so far without producing a satisfactory outcome.” Alistair Sinclair, chair of the Scottish Creel Fishermen’s Federation, blamed the French president, Emmanuel Macron, as well as the UK government for the difficulties, and warned that they were a foretaste of future negotiations. “This is possibly a demonstration of the difficulties that lie ahead should the UK think that they are truly going to take control of their waters. We are on a hiding to nothing as Europe will do all they can to protect opportunities for their fishing fleets,” he said. “Throughout the whole run-up to Brexit, our voice was not considered by the Scottish government and indeed the Tory grandees.” Fishers could try to comply with the regulations by taking on further processing of the molluscs, to gain the health certification necessary for exports, but this can be costly and time-consuming. Many had hoped that the Brexit agreement would allow for their exports to continue. The EU is the main market for many such specialist fishers. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Live bivalve molluscs such as oysters, mussels, clams, cockles and scallops can continue to be exported to the EU if they’re harvested from class A waters or cleaned, or have cleared end product testing in the UK. We will continue to raise the issue of live bivalve molluscs not ready for human consumption with the EU, to ensure the trade can continue securely.” The European commission confirmed that the requirements were not temporary, and were applicable to all such shellfish imported from the UK. Most of the fisheries affected are in England and Wales. Exports of bivalve molluscs are worth less than £12m a year, of which clams make up more than half, with oysters and mussels worth about £2.7m each. Defra said it could not estimate how much of this market would be affected as some are subject to “depuration” which would allow their export to continue."
2021-02-02T19:29:48Z,business,Business,Moonpig soars to £1.4bn at the end of its first day of trading,"Moonpig’s shares flew up 17% as it joined the stock market, valuing the company at £1.4bn at the end of its first day. The online greetings card and gift retailer, which also operates as Greetz in the Netherlands, placed 140m shares at an initial price of 350p on Tuesday, to give new investors a 41% stake in the company. The float raised £20m in new money to fund expansion while existing shareholders, including private equity firm Exponent, which has controlled the group since 2016, cashed out stakes worth more than £400m. Nickyl Raithatha, the chief executive of Moonpig Group, said that as the market shifted online, “now is the perfect time for us to bring the company to the public market, and we are excited about Moonpig’s prospects for the future”. Senior executives including Raithatha, finance director Andy MacKinnon and Kate Swann, a former chief executive of high street newsagent WH Smith who was appointed chair in 2019, sold shares worth more than £10m. Moonpig Group’s flotation follows a record Christmas as it cashed in on the closure of high street card shops, as restrictions on travel prompted people to send gifts and greeting cards bought online. It booked £156m in sales in the six months to the end of October, up from £173m for the entire previous year.
Founded two decades ago by Nick Jenkins, a former commodities trader and Dragon’s Den contestant, Moonpig’s name stems from his schoolboy nickname. Jenkins made £42m in 2011 from the sale of the business to the online photo printing company Photobox, which was later bought out by private equity. Neil Wilson at Markets.com said “[Moonpig’s] market share is huge (60% of online cards in the UK in 2019) and the trend towards online that will last beyond the pandemic is supportive of future growth. Huge market share, strong growth prospects and good margins – what is not to like? Maybe the valuation, but as we have seen before that is hardly a barrier to online retail stocks.” Moonpig’s debut comes amid a flurry of deal activity as investors look for winners from the switch to online that has been accelerated by the pandemic. Music Magpie, Deliveroo and Trustpilot are also thought to be looking at a stock market listing this year, while Dr Martens made a strong debut last week ."
2021-02-02T18:51:40Z,business,Business,TSB halves bonuses as UK bank reports £205m loss last year,"TSB is slashing banker bonuses in half, as the Spanish-owned lender nurses an annual loss of £205m and prepares for a potential sale. The bank’s annual report, due Wednesday, is expected to confirm that bonuses will be cut to just 3.9% of salary, which is less than half the 8.6% bonus granted for 2019. Chief executive Debbie Crosbie – who has waived her own bonus in light of the Covid crisis – is understood to have broken the news to staff in a virtual meeting on Monday morning. TSB’s roughly 6,500 workers, who shared a £17.7m bonus pool for 2019, are expected to share a pot of less than £9.5m this year. That is on top of an annual salary increase of just 0.75%, though unions bargained for a minimum £200 increase, meaning that the lowest-paid staff will see their salaries edge up by 1.1%. The salary increase has yet to be approved. Some rival bankers have fared worse. TSB’s former parent and larger rival Lloyds Banking Group announced in December that it was pre-emptively scrapping all bonuses after missing financial targets and recording a sharp drop in profits during the Covid crisis. It leaves staff across its Halifax, Lloyds and Bank of Scotland brands without a bonus pot for the first time in recent memory. Ged Nichols, general secretary of one of TSB’s staff unions, Accord, said: “2020 was a very difficult year. TSB’s staff have been brilliant. The recognition for partners through the variable pay award is being really well received. “The negotiated pay offer for 2021 isn’t all that we wanted. We’ll judge how members react to both elements of the news before deciding our next steps,” he said. Crosbie’s announcement on Monday came just hours after TSB revealed that it had swung to an annual loss of £205m in 2020, compared with a £46m profit a year earlier, after putting aside £164m to cover a potential surge in defaults sparked by the Covid crisis. The bank was also hit by more than £90m in costs linked to a three-year turnaround programme, which recently resulted in plans to cut nearly 1,000 staff and close 164 branches. The lender is now preparing itself for a potential sale. In November, it emerged that TSB’s Spanish owner, Sabadell, had appointed Goldman Sachs to conduct a review of the UK lender, which it bought for £1.7bn in 2015.
Speaking to journalists on Monday, Crosbie said Sabadell had not made a final decision, but was likely to make an announcement as part of a strategic review by May. It is understood that Sabadell is open to other options including selling a partial stake, floating TSB on the stock exchange or maintaining full ownership. Commenting on the 2020 bonus decision, a TSB spokesperson said staff had “excelled” in supporting customers during a challenging year. “We’re pleased to be able to recognise them for their service. This is in addition to the payment of £500 made to frontline staff last year.”"
2021-02-02T17:44:18Z,business,Business,Average British family spent extra £50 on groceries in January,"The average British family spent £50 more on groceries in January as schools, restaurants, pubs and cafes remained shut. A surge in sales of child-friendly lunch ingredients such as fresh pasta, peanut butter and chocolate spread underpinned £1bn in extra spending on food and drink in supermarkets in the four weeks to 24 January compared with last year. Healthy eating efforts helped boost sales of vegan-specific foods by nearly a quarter and no-alcohol beer by 12% in the month. But alcohol sales surged by an even stronger 29%, or £234m, as the closure of pubs and clubs led to increased drinking at home.
The analysis, published by the market research company Kantar, examined shopping data for England, Scotland and Wales. Post-Christmas lockdowns also prompted a resurgence in online grocery shopping, with older shoppers particularly keen to secure deliveries. Online sales accounted for 14% of total grocery takings, up from just under 13% reported in December, amid fears of catching more contagious forms of the virus that have emerged. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail at Kantar, said: “Retired households have boosted their online spend by a staggering 229% compared with January 2020. Older people are clearly getting more comfortable and proficient at ordering online and they now make up 28% of the 6.4 million who used online services in Great Britain this month [January].” The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a rapid change in the way we feed ourselves, driving massive growth for supermarkets and convenience stores as home cooking has replaced dining out and lunch in a school or workplace canteen. Total grocery sales rose by 12.2% year-on-year during the 12 weeks to 24 January 2021, a step up from the 11.4% reported a month ago. Independent convenience stores saw the strongest growth among retailers with physical stores, with sales up 20.9%, followed by Iceland, where sales rose nearly 22%. Morrisons was the fastest growing of the four biggest supermarket chains with sales up 14.3%, while the online specialist Ocado’s sales rose by almost 37%. McKevitt expects to see the pace of growth fall off as we reach the anniversary of the first national lockdown in March. “Sales will then be measured against the high volumes recorded in spring and summer 2020. With the vaccine rollout under way, there’s also hope that the hospitality sector will reopen, meaning demand for take-home groceries is likely to subside,” he said. Despite much talk of difficulties in importing food from the EU following the end of the Brexit transition period last month, McKevitt said there was so far little sign of an impact on consumers with “steady” food inflation of 1.3% in January."
2021-02-02T17:15:50Z,business,Business,Eurozone on course for double-dip recession,"The eurozone is on course for a double-dip recession after the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic during the last quarter of 2020 sent the currency bloc’s recovery into reverse. Eurozone national income, or GDP, fell by 0.7% from October to December as governments introduced new restrictions and lockdowns to try to curb the virus. GDP fell by 0.5% in the wider EU in the last three months of the year. With lockdowns likely to persist through much of the first quarter of 2021 and the EU commission struggling with its vaccine rollout programme, analysts said the currency block would almost certainly suffer a second bout of declining economic activity during January to March. A recession is defined as at least two consecutive quarters of negative growth. The euro tumbled to a nine-month low against the pound in response to the figures and the prospect of double-dip recession. Sterling rose to €1.1365 for the first time since last May, meaning one euro is worth 88p. The gloomy outlook for the eurozone was tempered by the shallowness of the fourth quarter dip, which was less severe than many economists feared following strong rebounds in output across the manufacturing and construction industries. Last year, eurozone GDP tumbled 11.4% in the second quarter, before a reversal that saw GDP increase by 12.4% in the third quarter. Statistics body Eurostat said the sum of the rises and falls in GDP was a 6.8% decline during 2020 as a whole. Christoph Weil, economist at Commerzbank, said eurozone GDP will keep shrinking as lockdowns persist and large parts of the services industry remain mothballed. “In the first quarter of 2021, the decline is likely to be somewhat steeper,” he said. “However, there will not be a slump like the one in the first half of 2020. Instead, a noticeable recovery is likely to set in again from the spring.” Raffi Boyadjian, senior investment analyst at currency trader XM, blamed the euro’s woes on persisting doubts about the EU’s ability to clean up its “vaccine mess” and the likelihood of an extension to the current lockdowns. The UK, which has yet to publish a GDP figure for 2020, is on course for a contraction of around 10% – the largest of any G7 country – according to the International Monetary Fund. It is likely to avoid a second recession after the Johnson administration delayed a full national lockdown until November, potentially lifting the average for the fourth quarter narrowly into positive territory. The UK figures will be published later this month."
2021-02-02T16:30:33Z,business,Business,"Adani pays $2,000 to anti-coal activist after Facebook post wrongly accused him of throwing rocks","The mining company Adani has paid $2,000 to an anti-coal activist and issued a public apology after it wrongly accused him and his protest group of throwing rocks and kicking work vehicles. Scott Daines, 53, secured the apology and payment after sending legal letters to the company when it named him in a Facebook post on 8 October 2020. Adani made the accusation on its main Facebook page, which has more than 37,000 followers, prompting threatening public comments towards Daines and the Frontline Action on Coal group to which he belongs.
In the apology, Adani said: “On 8 October 2020, we published a post about Scott Daines which contained allegations that he had damaged Adani property. These allegations were incorrect, and the post has been removed from this page. “Adani Australia apologises to Mr Daines for any hurt or distress this post may have caused.” Daines has been based for more than three years at a protest camp close to the construction of the mine in Queensland’s Galilee basin, which will dig up coal for export to power stations. Screenshots of the original post, seen by Guardian Australia, said “anti-coal activists have thrown rocks at our people’s utes as they travelled to work this morning and kicked their car doors.” Daines, who was the only individual named in the post, told the Guardian: “We pride ourselves on being non-violent and so to be accused of doing that is extremely hurtful.” The offending post from Adani came later on a day that had seen an altercation between an unidentified worker and a photographer, after an activist chose to be chained to a cattle grid, blocking the entrance to a work site. Screenshots show what appear to be threatening comments posted by individuals in response and apparently directed towards the activists. One commenter, referring to the remoteness of the mine site, wrote “things are very hard to find that go missing”. Another wrote “there’s always deep holes when you are mining”. Adani changed its name to Bravus Mining and Resources last year. Daines wrote to Adani requesting an apology and for the Facebook post to be removed. In further correspondence on 23 December, Adani agreed to pay Daines $2,000 for expenses incurred and to delete the original post and issue the apology. Adani originally posted the apology on Christmas Eve 2020 on a secondary page with fewer than 100 followers – a page with much less visibility than the one with 37,000 followers, where the original allegations had been made. After Daines complained in further letters to Adani’s solicitors, the apology appeared on 28 January 2021 on the same page as the original post. Daines said the money would go towards the ongoing campaign to prevent the mine from going ahead. “The campaign to stop Adani is extremely important,” he said. “People say this is just one mine, and yes it is, but it’s also about the potential for this to start a lot more mines in the Galilee basin.
“At this stage with everything we know about climate change, it is madness to open up a completely new coal basin.” Adani is now suing Brisbane-based activist Ben Pennings. As part of its case against Pennings, the India-based company engaged a private investigator to take photographs of his family. Guardian Australia sent questions to Adani about the apology, the time it had taken to place it on the Facebook page and about the comments which appeared alongside the original accusation. An Adani spokeswoman said: “Adani made a post about Mr Daines, the allegations made in that post were incorrect, and having been made aware of its error Adani has removed the post and published an apology to Mr Daines.”"
2021-02-02T16:23:29Z,business,Business,GameStop shares plunge as traders dump stock,"Shares in GameStop plunged by 65% in early trading on Wall Street as the trading mania sparked by small investors, that sent its stock surging and cost hedge funds billions of dollars, lost momentum. The struggling Texas-based video game store chain has been the focal point of a battle by small traders, using forums such as Reddit, to punish Wall Street hedge funds that have bet on certain stocks falling in value. GameStop shares hit a high of $482 last Thursday but slumped to $80 shortly after the market opened. They recovered to $117 by mid-session, but closed down 60% at $90. A year ago, shares in the 37-year-old chain, which plans to close 450 stores this year, were changing hands at $3.25 a share. Other heavily shorted stocks also targeted by amateur investors on influential forums such as WallStreetBets on Reddit are also in freefall. AMC Entertainment, the world’s biggest theatre chain and owner of Odeon in the UK, lost 55% shortly after the opening bell on Wall Street. It later made up some of those losses to trade at $8 by mid afternoon. Other companies whose shares were caught up in the frenzy – including Blackberry, Nokia and US retail chain Bed, Bath & Beyond, also all lost ground. Silver, which has also been caught up in the trading frenzy and hit $30 an ounce for the first time in eight-years on Monday – has fallen back , by 12%. Analysts said the size of the silver market makes it much harder to influence than a single stock. “In this case the fundamental drivers are holding, at least for the time being, against the irrationality of markets,” said Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at ActivTrades.
The tumble in GameStop’s shares indicates that the hedge funds betting against it, which had been caught in a “short squeeze” – a situation where they have been forced to buy more shares in a bid to stem their losses – have now closed out their positions. Short-sellers of Gamestop stock took a $20bn hit last month but short interest in the shares – as a percentage of shares available for trading – has plummeted from 114% in mid-January to about 39%, according to data from IHS Markit. “GameStop shares will return to $10 sooner or later once this mania has subsided,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com. “With hedges covered the unwind will be brutal.” The US share trader who was the real life Wolf of Wall Street also warned investors they “could lose everything”. Jordan Belfort was jailed in 1999 for insider trading. He had run a “pump and dump” trading scam, based on selling penny shares to gullible investors, which cost them some $200m. His autobiography was later turned into the Wolf of Wall Street movie, starring Leonardo Di Caprio and directed by Martin Scorsese. Belfort, 58 and now an author and motivational speaker, told the BBC that the Reddit investors who had poured their cash into unfashionable stocks which Wall St professionals were betting against should be careful: “If you are looking at this as a way to make your living, you’ll have to catch a falling knife on the way down. I would urge people to take their chips off the table.” He added: “Be aware of being the last person on the bandwagon, that is really the danger here.”"
2021-02-02T15:35:54Z,business,Business,BP reports $5.7bn loss as Covid-19 pandemic hits oil demand,"BP reported an annual loss for the first time in a decade after a “brutal” year in which the Covid-19 pandemic took its toll on the global oil industry. The oil company reported an underlying loss of $5.7bn (£4.2bn) for last year, compared with a profit of almost $10bn in 2019, after the pandemic cut demand for transport fuels, and caused oil prices on the global market to tumble. BP was forced to write off the value of its oil and gas assets by a total of $6.5bn last year after slashing its expectations for oil prices over the long-term. It also cut its global workforce by 10,000 and reduced its shareholder dividend for the first time since the Deepwater Horizon disaster last year, while its share price plunged to a 26 year low. The company’s annual loss including the writedown and other non-operating charges was $18.1bn for the year, the worst financial result since it reported a $4.9bn loss following the Deepwater Horizon disaster and one of worst ever recorded. All major oil companies struggled last year as coronavirus restrictions kept a lid on slowly rising global oil prices, which have been kept afloat by a pact between the Opec oil nations to limit oil production. The price of Brent crude has recovered from below $20 a barrel in April last year to more than $55 a barrel, but the market remains well below highs of almost $75 a barrel in 2019. BP has cut its forecasts for oil prices over the coming decades to an average of $55 a barrel between 2021 and 2050, down by almost a third from its forecasts before the pandemic. In the final quarter of a “brutal” year for BP, it reported a modest underlying profit of $115m, which was well below analyst forecasts of a $360m profit and a fraction of the $2.5bn reported for the same months in 2019. BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, said the “tough quarter at the end of an incredibly tough” year was “the most brutal I can remember in almost 30 years in this industry”. BP’s share price tumbled nearly 5% on Tuesday to 254p as equity analysts digested the worse than expected financial results, and the company’s slow progress on reducing its almost $40bn debt pile last year. “We expect much better days ahead for all of us in 2021,” Looney said.
Last year was “pivotal” for BP which bowed to growing pressure to act on its climate impact by setting a target to become a net zero carbon company by 2050, and has set in motion plans to cut its costs and reduce its debt. BP plans to increase its renewable energy portfolio from 3.2 gigawatts (GW) to 50GW by 2030, while producing less oil and gas to help cuts its contribution to the global climate crisis. Susannah Streeter, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Turning a tanker around with a storm raging was never going to be an easy manoeuvre and these numbers underline just how difficult the conditions are for BP as it attempts a rapid energy transition amid sunken oil demand.” The company is more than half way towards its target to sell off $25bn-worth of assets by 2025 to help fund its green plans, and expects divestments worth between $4bn to $6bn in the year ahead. The sales are also expected to help pay off BP’s net debt, which fell to $39bn at the end of 2020, down $1.4bn over the quarter and $6.5bn over the full year. “The focus for the company in the longer term will be on making the most of its remaining oil fields while investing in a low carbon future,” Streeter said, “But it will be like walking a tight rope for the business.’’"

2021-02-02T07:03:01Z,business,Business,RBA to pump $100bn into Australia's economy by extending quantitative easing,"The Reserve Bank of Australia will continue printing money through its quantitative easing program until September, pumping an additional $100bn into the economy, despite saying that recovery from the coronavirus crisis was stronger than expected. Economists say the decision shows that the economy remains fragile, with unemployment remaining high and inflation stuck below the RBA’s target of between 2% and 3%. In a speech on Monday Scott Morrison talked up the recovery, while at the same time preparing to remove support from businesses by ending the jobkeeper employment subsidy program at the end of March. At its meeting on Tuesday, the RBA board also left official interest rates unchanged at the record low level of 0.1%. “In Australia, the economic recovery is well under way and has been stronger than was earlier expected,” said the bank’s governor, Philip Lowe.
He said the RBA would not increase rates until wages growth, which has been less than 3% for almost seven years, was “materially higher than it is currently”. “This will require significant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market,” he said. “The board does not expect these conditions to be met until 2024 at the earliest.” He said at 6.6% the unemployment rate was the highest it had been for 20 years and would probably still be 5.5% by the end of next year. Lowe said the RBA had bought about $52bn worth of government bonds from banks and other financial institutions as part of the quantitative easing program, which began in March. The program was due to expire in April but the bank has extended it to September. The chief economist at BIS Oxford Economics, Sarah Hunter, said although the move seemed at odds with the RBA’s sunnier economic outlook, “to achieve the RBA’s inflation target the economy needs economic activity to be significantly higher than its pre-Covid peak”. “Australia’s economy entered the Covid downturn with capacity to spare, and notwithstanding the hit to migration the population and so productive potential of the country has increased since then.” Brendan Rynne, the chief economist at the accounting firm KPMG, said he expected the RBA to maintain its position for the foreseeable future. “The RBA has set out to do all it can to boost economic activity and, with business investment still fragile, and some weakness in the labour market in the new year, it will keep on its current course,” he said. He said one risk was the soaring price of houses and other assets, which “will further exacerbate the difference between the haves and have-nots in society”. This was mitigated by “ensuring lending standards are maintained to protect borrowers from over-extending themselves – including maintaining serviceability stringency and enforcing loan to-value ratio limits,” he said. The government has announced it wants to ditch responsible lending laws designed to stop banks pushing unaffordable loans on to borrowers, although the change may be rejected by sceptical crossbench senators. The banking analyst Grant Halverson said the RBA would have been worried by an “extraordinary” 6.9% fall in consumer, government and business payments in January. “These payments show the business, import/export and government payment daily volume average fell by $8bn per day,” he said. “Combine this with the record massive consumer savings and the decline in December retail sales and it spells trouble for banks, lenders and consumer spending.”"
2021-02-01T20:30:25Z,business,Business,"Treasury should consider next steps over LC&F collapse, MPs told","The Treasury needs to consider whether the governor of the Bank of England should face “consequences” over his mishandling of an investment scandal in a previous job, according to the head of an independent inquiry into the matter. Dame Elizabeth Gloster, a former high court judge, told MPs on Monday that it was for the Treasury and those running the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to consider whether action should be taken against three individuals named in her report on the collapse of London Capital & Finance, and what form that should take. The three individuals include Andrew Bailey, who was the chief executive of the FCA from July 2016 until March 2020, when he took the job of Bank governor. More than 11,600 people had invested a total of £237m – an average of £20,000 each – when LC&F collapsed in January 2019. Its “mini-bonds” had promised returns to investors of up to 8% a year. Just before Christmas, the inquiry led by Gloster concluded that the FCA failed to properly supervise and regulate LC&F before the firm went under. The government-backed investigation’s report identified “significant gaps and weaknesses” in the regulator’s policies and practices, and stated that “responsibility for the failure in respect of the FCA’s approach to its perimeter rests with ExCo [the FCA’s executive committee] and Mr Bailey”. During the first in a series of evidence sessions on the LC&F scandal, MPs on the Treasury select committee said it might appear to some observers that there had not been any significant consequences for the senior figures at the FCA who were responsible for the failings. Gloster replied: “Those who are, or I hope will be, informed by my report will need to consider what are the appropriate consequences in the light of the criticisms which I have made, in relation to the organisation and individually.” She added: “I do think it’s a matter for which consideration should be given, not by me but by the chairman and the CEO of the FCA, and the Treasury, so far as the Bank of England is concerned … They should give consideration as to what they consider it is appropriate to do in the light of the serious criticisms and conclusions which I have made.” However, she said that if she was being asked “should they pay a fine, should they return their bonuses,” that was not a matter for her to decide.
The Bank of England declined to comment on Gloster’s comments. It is understood that Bailey will appear before the committee as part of its LC&F inquiry next Monday. The inquiry found that the FCA ultimately failed to make sure that LC&F was following the rules, and needed better training for its staff. On 17 December it emerged that the financial services compensation scheme had paid out a total of just over £50m to 2,584 LCF bondholders, and it is continuing to assess outstanding claims. In the wake of the findings, the government said the Treasury would set up a compensation scheme for LCF bondholders."
2021-02-01T20:00:16Z,business,Business,The Reddit flash mob won't be able to work the GameStop magic on silver | Nils Pratley,"Attempting to corner the silver market has a long and dishonourable history, so one can understand why members of the have-a-go Reddit crew might be attracted to a version of the idea. The day traders also appear to have chosen one tactic correctly. They targeted silver exchange traded funds, or ETFs, which are obliged to back their units with physical holdings of the metal. Yes, that’s the way to get maximum bang for your buck. No messing about with funds that merely hold derivative silver contracts. The price of the metal jumped by 10%.
So far, so familiar – or, at least, familiar since last week’s fun and games in GameStop, AMC and others. Yet this latest iteration of “flashmob” investing is different. The central tactic may be correct, but the overall plan looks wildly overambitious. For starters, there are no obviously overextended hedge funds to beat up. Second, the price of silver is hard to push around artificially for any length of time. Both thoughts seemed to have occurred to members of the Reddit army, which looks less than united about the wisdom of this expedition. Some on the WallStreetBets forum pointed out that banks and hedge funds, the supposed enemies, aren’t enthusiastic short-sellers of the metal. Good point: the data shows institutions are actually net long. Indeed, even the short positions won’t always be what they seem. Some will have been created for reasons of genuine hedging. If, for example, you’re a big investor in Fresnillo, the FTSE 100 silver miner, you might maintain a short position in silver as a way to hedge out market risk. Such a hedge would have done its job on Monday: the pain of a 10% rise in the price of silver was matched by the relief of a big gain in Fresnillo’s share price. So who is hurting? Then one has to consider the size of the silver market. GameStop was a struggling video games retailer worth $1.5bn at the start of the year. By contrast, the value of the silver market is more like $1.5tn, so it’s hard to sustain the same market-moving momentum. Real-world manufacturers need silver for use in cars and computers, but they also keep stocks of the stuff. So they do not become forced buyers overnight, unlike the hedge funds at Gamestop, who stupidly made the same overcrowded bet. Monday’s dramatic surge in the silver is not to be sniffed at. It was a significant move. But was it just small-time investors buying? Or were hedge funds, or others, enjoying some sport by anticipating the Redditors’s intentions (which were advertised since last week) and adding a bit of speculative money in an attempt to catch a pop in the price? If so, one suspects the professionals will have banked their profits already. That’s the worry about “meme” investing. It creates short-term trading opportunities for those who can read, and create, social media forces. But the likely losers are who get sucked in and arrive late. Silver was an odd target to pick, especially with the price now at an eight-year high. It’s a case of frothy market and frothy thinking. The tale of London Capital & Finance winds to a sorry end “Those who, I hope, will be informed by my report will need to consider what are the appropriate consequences in the light of the criticisms which I have made, in relation to the organisation and individually.” Her wording was slightly opaque, but one could catch Dame Elizabeth Gloster’s drift. The London Capital & Finance affair was a serious financial scandal and the question of accountability should be addressed. And the question applies to those at the top of the Financial Conduct Authority at the time, including Andrew Bailey, then the regulator’s chief executive, now governor of the Bank of England. In practice, the chances of Bailey losing his job, or even being censured, are remote. If the chancellor was minded to act, he would have done so by now. But that political reality doesn’t make the saga any prettier. Some 11,600 individuals who invested £236m lost most of their money in LC&F, and Gloster’s blistering 500-page report showed how the FCA ignored red flags for years. It is a shocking tale. And it is equally shocking how smoothly the financial and political establishment moves on."
2021-02-01T19:58:43Z,business,Business,Silver price hits eight-year high; Robinhood raises another $2.4bn  – as it happened,"Right, time to recap: Silver has risen to its highest level in eight years, amid a burst of activity in the precious metal. Silver hit $30.03 per troy ounce for the first time since February 2013 today, surging over 10%, but has now dropped back to around $28.60, up 6% today. Some analysts attributed the frenzied rise to retail investors, with bullion dealers reporting a surge in demand for coins and bars over the weekend. But on Reddit, several popular WallStreetBets posts insisted that theyâ€™re not behind the surge in the silver price today. One theory, popular on WSB, is that hedge funds have been attempting to lure small investors into attempting a â€˜short squeezeâ€™ on silver, rather than maintaining their focus on heavily shorted stocks like GameStop. GameStopâ€™s shares have come under pressure today, dropping by over 30% at one stage. Theyâ€™re currently hovering around $242, down 25% today - but still up around 1,200% this year. Fintech firm S3 Partners has reported that the hedge funds have been cutting their short positions in GameStop, meaning the short squeeze is in â€˜full forceâ€™. Those hedge funds will have incurred heavy losses by closing their short positions, and also lowered the amount of GameSpot shares shorted. S3 says: As S3 short insight data shows, GameStop shares shorted significantly declined as short sellers began liquidating their holdings. Over the last few days, GameStop short interest has decreased from $11.20 billion to $8.82 billion. Short sellers bought to cover and trimmed positions as they incurred large mark-to-market losses. GME shares shorted are now 27.13 million. GME price volatility has been remarkably high, and the stock has gained +400% over the last week. Long shareholders have been able to support GMEâ€™s stock price and rally it to historically high levels. While long shareholders are looking at significant mark-to-market gains, shorts are now down -$15.31 billion in year-to-date mark-to-market losses. Both fundamental and momentum short sellers have found opportunities and price exit points to trim their positions in the face of these losses. The GME short squeeze is in full force.
Trading app Robinhood has raised another $2.4bn from investors to strengthen its financial position. This has allowed it to increase the limits on trading in the heavily shorted companies which surged last week, amid the short squeeze on hedge funds. Global stock markets are recovering from last weekâ€™s wobble, with the UKâ€™s FTSE 100 gaining almost 1%. In the US, the Dow Jones industrial average is up over 1%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq has jumped by 2.5% in late afternoon trading. Hereâ€™s our round-up of todayâ€™s action:

2021-02-01T19:53:52Z,business,Business,Private jet hire firm Wheels Up to go public in $2.1bn deal,"Wheels Up, a private jet hire company backed by Serena Williams and Lance Armstrong, has announced plans to go public in a deal that will value the business at $2.1bn (£1.5bn). The company, which its founder describes as the “Uber of the sky”, said it had agreed a deal to float on the New York Stock Exchange via a merger with Aspirational Consumer Lifestyle Corp, a “blank cheque” special purpose acquisition company (Spac). The use of Spacs, shell companies which use proceeds from an initial public offerings to take a private firm public through the back door, has rocketed in recent months adding to mounting fears global stock markets may be in a bubble about to burst. Spacs are popular topics of conversation on Reddit message boards that have been thrust into focus over the hyping up of GameStop shares. Kenny Dichter, Wheels Up’s founder and chief executive, said he hoped the merger would turn the digital jet booking platform, which launched in 2013, into the “Uber of the sky”. “We are excited about crossing this milestone and our new partnership with Aspirational,” he added. “We believe this will allow us to actualise our founding goal of democratising private aviation, through our unique membership model, suite of products and benefits, and by bringing the shared economy to private aviation through our Wheels Up app. We are looking forward to joining forces with the Aspirational team as we continue to accelerate our global growth and expansion.” Wheels Up offers its customers a three-tier membership programme with reduced annual fees for new clients ranging from $2,995 to $29,500, excluding the cost of hiring a private jet. Delta Airlines, which has an equity stake in Wheels Up from the merger of Delta Private Jets with Wheels Up last year, will remain a shareholder when the deal is completed."
2021-02-01T18:21:26Z,business,Business,Asos buys Topshop and Miss Selfridge brands for £330m,"The online fashion retailer Asos is the new owner of Topshop and other leading brands from Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia empire after a £330m deal that puts thousands of jobs at risk. The deal also includes Topman, Miss Selfridge and the activewear brand HIIT, which were put up for sale after Arcadia collapsed into administration last year. Asos, which only operates online, has not agreed to buy any of the brands’ 70 stores, putting at risk the jobs of 2,500 high-street shop workers. It is understood an additional 50 stores have permanently shut since administrators were appointed in November. Warehouse and head office jobs are also at risk. Only 300 head office staff will be saved as part of the Asos deal, to help with design, buying and retail partnerships. An administrators’ report seen by the Guardian last week showed that Topshop and Topman alone employ about 4,792 staff. Arcadia Group as a whole employed 13,000 staff and had 500 stores across the UK when it entered administration in November. Asos paid £330m in total, including £265m for the brands and £65m for current and future stock. The deal does not include any of Arcadia’s warehouses or its distribution centre in Daventry. The Asos chief executive, Nick Beighton, said the company already had its own “well-funded and built out warehouse strategy” and the Daventry site was not purpose-built to handle online shopping orders. Administrators at Deloitte have asked Asos to consider keeping open Topshop’s flagship Oxford Street store, though Beighton said he would only be interested in a third-party partnership, rather than adopting the lease or buying the site entirely. “It’s not our core model to take stores, nor our core strategy, but never say never. So, since we were presented with opportunity we said we’d have a look, but it’s not our number one priority or focus right now,” he said. The online retailer, which confirmed last week it was in exclusive negotiations with Arcadia’s administrators after the Guardian first revealed the talks, will complete the takeover by Thursday. The changeover is expected to take place on Wednesday night, with customers likely to be greeted with a webpage redirecting them to the Asos site, which will start incorporating the new brands into its own online platform. Beighton said he was “extremely proud” of the deal. “The acquisition of these iconic British brands is a hugely exciting moment for Asos and our customers and will help accelerate our multibrand platform strategy,” he said. “We have been central to driving their recent growth online and, under our ownership, we will develop them further, using our design, marketing, technology and logistics expertise, and working closely with key strategic retail partners in the UK and around the world.”
The deal sent Asos shares up nearly 7% on Monday. A report by the administrators Deloitte, seen by the Guardian, suggested Green’s family was likely to receive £50m from the sale, relating to an interest-free loan it made to the group in 2019 at the time of an emergency restructure. However, more than 1,000 suppliers and landlords to the high-street fashion chain will get less than 1% of the money owed to them. Meanwhile, affected workers commented on Twitter, with one saying they had worked for Topshop for two years but that their manager only heard their jobs were at risk through news reports on Monday. “It’s actually disgusting … the administrators didn’t inform us, the press/social media knew before we did. Disappointed isn’t the word today,” they said.
Asos is believed to have beaten other potential bidders including the Chinese fashion retailer Shein, Authentic Brands, the US owner of the Barneys department store – which was linked to a joint bid with JD Sports – and the billionaire Issa brothers, who in October announced they were buying Asda for £6.8bn. Online group Boohoo confirmed last week it had entered into exclusive talks to buy the final three Arcadia brands: Wallis, Dorothy Perkins and Burton. Evans, its plus-size clothing brand, was sold to the Australian retailer City Chic Collective for £23m in December."
2021-02-01T17:22:43Z,business,Business,Ford to install Google's Android operating system in most cars from 2023,"Google and Ford have signed a deal under which the Android operating system will be installed in most of the US carmaker’s vehicles in the latest sign of technology companies’ interest in the automotive sector. Ford will start installing Android in all its cars outside China from 2023 for at least six years. Google, owned by the Alphabet holding company, will also work with the carmaker on projects including modernising its manufacturing processes and developing new ways of buying cars. The agreement marks the latest foray by America’s big tech companies into the automotive world. Apple, Alphabet’s major mobile phone operating system rival, last month sent a shiver through the automotive industry after the Korean carmaker Hyundai revealed that the two companies were in talks about a possible partnership. Other carmakers have also inked deals with big tech companies. Ford’s biggest US rival, General Motors, is working with Microsoft on autonomous driving technology, while Google is working with Renault on improving its manufacturing abilities. The deals come at a time when traditional carmakers are struggling under the financial burden of large investments in developing electric vehicles and autonomous driving, at the same time as coping from the loss of revenue caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Ford has been relatively slow in embracing electric car technology, although it has recently launched its first all-electric car, the Mustang Mach-E SUV. Jim Farley, Ford’s chief executive, said the deal “establishes an innovation powerhouse truly able to deliver a superior experience for our customers and modernise our business”. Computer operating systems are seen as a key battleground for the automotive industry in the coming years, with technology companies hoping to sell lucrative services to passengers. The market is expected to grow rapidly even before cars are capable of driving without human input. Executives at the two companies declined to provide commercial details of the agreements, including whether the companies will share revenues from services sold within the car or how it would be funded. While the Android operating system will be the preferred option, Ford said its cars would still offer the ability to link with Apple’s iPhones through its CarPlay technology, and it would still continue to offer Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant. However, Ford and Google will work together on in-car apps. Google will also use its data handling abilities to help improve Ford’s management of its supply chain, and to accelerate its development of new cars. Google said no data generated by the cars would be shared with or sold to third parties."
2021-02-01T16:59:25Z,business,Business,GMB calls to renew British Gas strike over 'fire and rehire' plan,"More than 200,000 households could face delays to their boiler repairs during some of the coldest weeks of winter as the GMB union calls to resume its British Gas strike from Friday. The union has called on its members working as field engineers for Britain’s largest energy supplier to down tools for another five days as part of a nation-wide response to the company’s “fire and rehire” plans. The GMB says the latest strike action will add to a backlog of 170,000 boiler repairs and 200,000 delayed service visits, ahead of a cross-party parliamentary inquiry on the dispute scheduled for Tuesday. A statement from British Gas said it had strong contingency plans in place and would prioritise vulnerable households and emergencies. The GMB’s national secretary, Justin Bowden, said the company’s claim to be catching up on the work was bogus and that a protracted dispute was looming. Bowden will face the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee on Tuesday to answer MPs’ questions alongside Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of British Gas’s parent company, Centrica. The GMB called a 12-day day strike last month after balloting its 9,200 British Gas members. Around 59% took part in the vote, of whom 89% – or 4,830 workers – voted in favour of industrial action. About 80% of Centrica’s 20,000 staff have agreed to sign up to the new employment contracts. GMB’s call to down tools followed months of tense negotiations between its representatives and Centrica over its plans to reduce its workforce and shift employees on to new contracts. The union has accused Centrica of “bullying” its 20,000 employees into accepting worse employment contracts or losing their jobs as part of a “fire and rehire” plan. The embattled FTSE company, which has lost more than three-quarters of its market value in the last five years, said the decision to ask all employees to sign up to new employment contracts was always a “final resort option”. “Our business needs to change to survive and protect 20,000 jobs,” a spokesperson said. “We know change is difficult but we have offered a fair deal that has been negotiated over 300 hours with unions where base pay and pensions are protected.”"
2021-02-01T16:30:12Z,business,Business,Australia needs to stop thinking that setting a target of zero emissions by 2050 is good enough | Greg Jericho,"We need to change how we talk about climate change policy. No longer can we hand out pass marks for irrelevant targets that sound good but actually fail to prevent climate change. Back in 2018, the IPCC announced that we had 12 years to limit temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. This set off a lot of focus on different numbers: net zero by 2050 or 2045, 45% cuts by 2030 or 2035, 26% by 2030:
It’s no surprise that voters didn’t really grasp what is going on, because these targets actually disguise the reality of the task at hand and serve only to confuse. Right now, the Morrison government remains wedded to a 26% cut in emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 and yet are on target for just 22%. Before the last election the ALP pledged a 45% cut by 2030, but now is fudging because the government itself is unwilling to set a target beyond 2030 until after the next election. Last year the talk was that the ALP would push the 45% cut out to 2035. You can understand why voters tune out a bit – I mean is there much difference between 45% by 2030 or 2035, or between getting to zero by 2045 or 2050? Yes there is – a massive difference. And the reason is why a report last week by the Climate Targets Panel argues we need a 50% cut by 2030. For, you see, the numbers we should focus on are not 2045 or 2050 but 6,161 and 3,521. Or, to be precise: 6,161Gt C02-e and 3,521Gt C02-e. These are the actual amount of carbon we can emit to keep temperatures below either 1.5C or 2C above pre-industrial levels. The carbon emitted last year doesn’t get wiped away – it stays, adding to the impact of climate change. Because we know the impact of carbon on temperatures, we can estimate how much more carbon can be emitted before there is too much in the atmosphere to prevent temperatures rising by certain amounts. Research by Melbourne University climate scientist Malte Meinshausen done for the Victorian government estimates that Australia’s share of the global carbon budget is 6,161Gt C02-e in order to stay below a 2C increase, and 3,521Gt C02-e to stay below a 1.5C increase. If we emit more than that we are contributing towards those higher temperatures. This is the true vandalism of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments – their choices to increase emissions mean much greater cuts now are needed. Think of it like a bank account. Imagine you have $61,610 to last you for 30 weeks. That works out at $2,053 dollars to spend a week. But what if you spend $48,880 in the first 10 weeks? Oops. You just used up 79% of your budget in a third of the time. This is what we are currently projected to do with our carbon budget. The latest government projections are for Australia to emit 4,880Gt C02-e in the 10 years to 2030. If we keep on that path, we will use up all of our 2C budget of 6,161GT C02-e by 2033:
And this is where the difference between those median-term targets matter. Were the ALP to extend its median target of a 45% cut to 2035, that would actually be a pledge to use up all of our carbon budget by 2035. A target of a 45% cut by 2035 is a target to fail. The reason why the Carbon Target Panel argues we need a 50% cut by 2030 is because that trend will keep us from using up all of the 2C budget. The bad news? Even that target will have us use up the carbon budget of 3,521GT C02-e we need to limit ourselves to limit temperatures below 1.5C. The only way we can keep within the 1.5C budget it to target net zero emissions by 2035 – that would require cutting emissions by nearly three quarters by 2030:
The problem is that because emissions stay in the atmosphere, even if the government were to announce it will target net zero emissions by 2050, given how much will have been emitted by 2030 we will still go more than 50% over our carbon budget:
This is why, if Scott Morrison comes out and pledges getting to zero by 2050, no one should give him any credit whatsoever. Unless he explains how he will do so and keep within our carbon budget, the pledge will be meaningless. Currently if we want to do it in a nice straight line, we need to reach 50% cuts by 2030 and net zero by 2045. That is the least disruptive timeline. But if we keep on the current rate, so much of our budget will we have used by 2030 that we will need to slash emissions drastically and get to next zero by 2036:
A target of 45% cut by 2035 gives us no hope, and a target of 45% by 2030 means we would need to then get to zero by 2042. So we need to stop thinking that setting a target of zero emissions by 2050 is good enough – we need to be asking what political parties are doing to keep within our carbon budget. And if they don’t know, then we should treat their policies with the contempt they deserve."
2021-02-01T15:51:55Z,business,Business,Hargreaves Lansdown reports rise in half-year profits amid influx of new investors,"Britain’s largest retail investment company, Hargreaves Lansdown, has reported a rise in half-year profits as vaccine hopes and the US election result prompted an influx of younger clients looking to invest in stock markets. The broker said it had attracted £3.2bn worth of new business and another 84,000 clients since June, as the Covid outbreak reinforced the importance of saving as well as investing. Nearly half of all new clients were aged between 30 and 54. Investor confidence fluctuated throughout 2020, but risk appetite improved in the final three months of the year thanks to “the US election and positive news of the Covid-19 vaccine”, the firm said. It sparked a rush in stock trading volumes, which jumped 123% in the second half of 2020, helping to push pre-tax profits up 10% to £188m. The broker, which was founded by the billionaire Peter Hargreaves and Stephen Lansdown from a spare bedroom in Bristol in 1981, now serves a record 1.5 million active customers and handles nearly £121bn worth of assets, a 16% increase from a year earlier. Its chief executive, Chris Hill, said the company had “delivered a period of very strong growth with record new clients and increased market share against the backdrop of the pandemic and the political uncertainty of the US elections and Brexit. “As our client numbers continue to grow, we are finding that younger people are taking a greater interest in investing for the future, with the average age of our clients continuing to fall. Covid-19 has underpinned the importance of financial resilience,” he said. Most banks and stock market trading platforms have benefited from Covid restrictions, because customers lucky enough to have kept their jobs or benefited from government support programmes have spent less during lockdown, leaving them more money to put into savings and investments, including shares. A surge in extra cash has helped propel a trading frenzy on Wall Street in recent weeks. An army of small investors with links to the WallStreetBets forum on Reddit banded together to invest in unloved stocks targeted by hedge funds including GameStop, which surged from $20 to as much as $450 last week. The Financial Conduct Authority has told UK investors to use “extreme caution” when buying stocks being discussed in online forms. “Volatile markets are unpredictable and mean you can quickly lose money. Losses are unlikely to be covered by the financial services compensation scheme,” it said. Hargreaves Lansdown shares were down 3.8% on Monday afternoon."
2021-02-01T14:19:33Z,business,Business,Ryanair warns it could lose nearly €1bn  amid Covid-19 lockdown,"Ryanair has warned it is heading for an annual loss of nearly €1bn (£880m) as the budget airline struggles through the “most challenging’” year in its 35-year history. The carrier said traffic had fallen by 78% in the final three months of 2020, comparedwith a year earlier, pushing the company to a €306m third-quarter loss. It partly blamed fresh restrictions and UK travel bans introduced in the week before Christmas, which meant passengers who would usually fly to see friends and family over the holidays stayed home. Ryanair said it was experiencing its toughest year, as ever-changing travel restrictions, European lockdowns and the slower vaccine rollout put it on track for a full-year net loss of between €850m and €950m. It would be the airline’s first annual loss since 2009. While the airline said it was comforted by the success of the UK’s vaccination programme, which aims to offer jabs to all adults in the UK by September, the EU was not keeping pace, putting bookings at risk. “The EU now needs to step up the slow pace of its rollout programme to match the UK’s performance,” Ryanair said in a statement. The Ryanair chief executive, Michael O’Leary, is banking on a boom in summer bookings following the successful vaccination of elderly and vulnerable populations, and said he expected a revival of European beach holidays this summer. “Ninety-three per cent all of the deaths arising from coronavirus are in people over 65. Once you eliminate that risk through vaccinations in the UK and in the EU, then frankly we don’t see any need for travel restrictions,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We think, certainly, intra-European travel will resume with strong pent-up demand so we expect to see a very strong return of British families travelling to the beaches of Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece in relative safety this summer, thanks to the vaccine rollout programme.” Ryanair’s bullish stance on the vaccination programme means it has already fallen foul of advertising standards authorities, who took issue with its “jab and go” campaign in January for encouraging people to book flights immediately on the promise of a coronavirus vaccine. Most of its flights from the UK and Ireland have been withdrawn until lockdown restrictions are lifted, and it expects to fly 26-30 million passengers over the 12 months to the end of March – less than a quarter of pre-Covid traffic. Despite its troubles, with Ryanair’s revenues down 80% or €5.8bn year on year, the airline is confident it will rebound and said there would be more opportunities, with rival carriers set to fail during the pandemic, following the likes of Flybe, IAG’s Level and Lufthansa’s Germanwings.
The airline said: “We expect intra-European capacity to be significantly reduced for the next few years, which will create opportunities for Ryanair to take advantage of recovery growth incentives.” Ryanair retains more than €3.5bn in cash and in December extended its Boeing 737 Max order to 210 planes, with a view to restarting its ambitious growth towards 200 million passengers a year by 2025. The airline hopes to be operating 24 of Boeing’s recently recertified planes by this summer. Rival easyJet last week announced an 88% decline in revenues year on year but also reported a surge in summer bookings, significantly ahead of normal patterns."
2021-02-01T12:36:02Z,business,Business,West Midlands was worst-hit part of UK economy in first Covid-19 wave,"The West Midlands was the hardest hit part of the UK during the record-breaking collapse in the economy during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, official figures have shown. In a breakdown of the 18.8% fall in gross domestic product during the second quarter of 2020, the Office for National Statistics said the region that includes Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Coventry had a 21% drop in output. The ONS data revealed that it was the second quarter in a row the West Midlands had seen the biggest fall in GDP, after a 4.7% decline in the first three months of the year. Three other English regions recorded falls in output of more than 20% between April and June – the period when the economic hit from the pandemic was most severe. The east of England had a fall of 20.9%, the south-east 20.6% and the north-west 20.3%. London was the least badly affected region, with a fall of 16.6%. Of the four countries that make up the UK, the ONS said Scotland had been worst affected, recording a fall in GDP of 19.4% in the second quarter. Declines of 19%, 15.1% and 13.6% were recorded by England, Wales and Northern Ireland respectively.
The UK is on course for a fall of about 10% in GDP during 2020 as a whole, making it one of the worst-performing developed economies. In a separate release, the ONS said that in part this was due to tougher restrictions being in place for longer and the share of consumption – curtailed by the lockdown – being larger in the UK than in other countries. But it pointed out the UK had a different method for measuring Covid-19’s impact on the public and once this was accounted for the gap with other G7 nations was not as large."
2021-02-01T08:49:35Z,business,Business,"Rio Tinto waives $300,000 electricity bill to Arnhem Land school after error made public","Rio Tinto has waived a miscalculated $300,000 electricity bill to a primary school in Arnhem land, one day after the bill was made public. The ABC reported on Sunday that Nhulunbuy primary school, about 650km east of Darwin, owed the mining giant $300,000 in underpaid electricity bills. A spokeswoman from the NT Department of Education said the underpayment was detected by Rio Tinto and it notified the school in mid-2020. The accidental debt was accrued in just over two years, with the bill miscalculated between December 2016 and April 2019, the department said. The story prompted a wave of criticism of Rio Tinto on social media. It comes just days after the company announced a reshuffle intended to “focus on rebuilding trust and strengthening external relationships across Australia” after the destruction of the ancient Juukan Gorge rock shelters in Western Australia.
The reshuffle was announced by the new global CEO, Jakob Stausholm, whose predecessor, Jean-Sébastien Jacques, resigned over the Juukan Gorge incident. A spokesman for Rio Tinto told Guardian Australia on Monday that the company had decided to waive the miscalculated electricity costs. “Upon review and consideration with the Northern Territory Department of Education, Rio Tinto will waive past power costs that were inaccurately billed to the Nhulunbuy primary school,” he said. “We understand how important accurate information on costs are to local partners and will work hard to prevent any such billing errors in the future.” The education department said the school had previously negotiated a payment plan with Rio Tinto, which the company agreed to, but was contacted by Rio to say the bill would be waived. “The department is appreciative of the goodwill extended by Rio Tinto and thank them for waiving the bill,” a spokeswoman said. Rio Tinto had been providing electricity to the school for 48 years. Brynn O’Brien, from the Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said it was “difficult to understand” why Rio Tinto had not waived the bill immediately, “given the pressure they are under to improve their relationships with communities”. “This is not going to do their reputation any favours as they seek to move on from the Jacques era,” O’Brien said. The National Native Title Council has previously said that Rio Tinto was “still on notice” with regard to its treatment of First Nations people and heritage, and described the reshuffle announcement – which did not make reference to the company’s management of Indigenous heritage – as “a bit of PR spin”. Guardian Australia has contacted the NT Department of Education for comment."
2021-02-01T07:00:00Z,business,Business,UK jigsaw puzzle sales hit £100m as 'people find a balance in their lives',"From hygge-inspired depictions of “cosy” sheds to currently off-limits country pubs and taxing single colour images, Britain has officially been gripped by jigsaw puzzle mania. Figures show UK sales of jigsaws reached £100m in 2020, up 38% on the previous year. Covid-19 restrictions on socialising also resulted in more puzzles being bought for adults rather than children, which is not the norm, with 15m sold. The sales bonanza was “totally unheard of”, said Frédérique Tutt, a global industry analyst at the market researchers NPD. Puzzles are a constant presence in the fickle toy market but manufacturers have been overwhelmed by the level of demand. “Manufacturers have said to us, you could sell anything, even a white image,” Tutt said. “They ran out of stock in the spring and again just before Christmas.” The bestselling jigsaw format is 1,000 pieces, costing about £12, meaning consumers were getting “hours and hours of entertainment” for a relatively small outlay at a time when they may be strapped for cash, Tutt said. The German toymaker Ravensburger said its overall sales increased by more than a fifth to €632m (£546m) in 2020, with the company singling out stellar growth in the UK. Ravensburger shifted a total of 28m puzzles, a third more than in 2019. Its chairman, Clemens Maier, suggested puzzles had helped “lots of people find a balance in their lives, especially in a time of crisis”. Early on in the year the company increased production at its factories in Germany and the Czech Republic to satisfy a level of demand it usually experienced before Christmas. Despite this, “demand outstripped supply capacity for some products”, it said. The company’s sales data showed UK puzzlers – known as dissectologists – seeking escapism in imaginary scenes such as “my cosy shed”, which boasts a comfy sofa and log-burning stove, as well as challenging puzzles where the doer has to crack hidden codes, or work on shape alone as the image is a plain colour. Julie Wilkins of the Dorset based JHG Puzzles said its sales in 2020 had quadrupled, making it the company’s biggest year since it started in 1997. “Nostalgia is big,” she said. “Animals and birds but also what people call ‘chocolate box’ [art]: pubs, inns and cottages, are popular.” The most sought-after challenge is 1,000 pieces but, perhaps with some months to go before Covid-19 restrictions come to an end, Ravensburger said demand for harder ones was increasing. Last year it launched a 40,000 piece Disney set. With the finished image measuring 6.8m by 1.9m, you would need plenty of space to tackle it. Peter Day, who helps run the Benevolent Confraternity of Dissectologists, a club for puzzle followers, said its members had previously feared interest in the hobby was waning. “The club has an ageing population,” he said. “I am in my 60s and I’m almost the youth policy.”
Puzzles offered escapism and entertainment but were also educational, said Day, whose club has been meeting virtually on Zoom. “A lot of our members feel like it helps keep them ticking over.” But if you are just getting into jigsaws you may have to wait to get your hands on the one you want. With non-essential shops closed, popular ones have often sold out online, a situation made worse by the decision taken by some websites based in Europe to stop shipping to the UK since Brexit. Tutt predicts the puzzle boom will continue until the summer at least: “After that I think some consumers will go back to cinema, travelling, restaurants and find more exciting things to do … but some will stay because they enjoyed the me-time or screen-free downtime.”"
2021-02-01T06:59:44Z,business,Business,Wealthy people in UK still driven to splash out on supercars,"Wealthy people in the UK are buying more luxury supercars than ever before, according to Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency figures shared with the Guardian. Almost 16,000 supercars â€“ such as Ferrari, Bugatti, Aston Martin, Maserati and Koenigsegg models â€“ were registered at UK addresses in the year to December 2019, according to figures released after a freedom of information request. They cost from hundreds of thousands to more than Â£1m each but concerns about the economy have done nothing to dampen enthusiasm for the trophy vehicles. The DVLA registered an increase of 12% from 14,000 in the previous year, according to the data released to the accountants UHY Hacker Young, and seen by the Guardian. The City of Westminster, which includes the central London areas of Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Belgravia, is home to 532 supercars â€“ making it the supercar capital of the UK. The underground car park at One Hyde Park, the most expensive block of flats in the country, is thought to hold one of the highest concentration of supercars in the world. Parking spaces in the Westminster development â€“ in which one apartment was sold for Â£160m â€“ have sold for as much as Â£300,000 each. David Kendrick, a partner at UHY Hacker Young, said: â€œDespite all of the economic uncertainty around Brexit, UK celebrities, sports stars and business executives continue to snap up the latest supercars, leading to many manufacturers having lengthy waiting lists. â€œOut of all of the brands, Ferrari is still the biggest selling but Lamborghinis and McLarens are quickly becoming the supercars of choice,â€� he added. â€œWhile Westminster maintains its supercar hotspot crown, weâ€™re likely to see a bigger concentration of supercars outside of London as the wealthy seek more space as working from home becomes the new norm.â€� In 2018, Ferrari sold its entire production run of a new Monza Â£1m-plus supercar before it had even begun making the vehicles. Luxury car producers are also cashing in on the expensive taste for personalising vehicles, with upgrades including televisions, champagne fridges and even paint mixed with crushed diamonds. One Swedish billionaire paid for a one million satin stitch rose garden fabric interior. Others have had the roof of a vehicle studded with more than 1,000 LED lights recreating the sky at night â€“ complete with shooting stars. The royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea, home to socialites, celebrities and City bankers, comes in a close second, with 479 supercars registered. There are so many supercars in the borough that the council has set up cameras to tackle drivers using streets as racetracks. The council said it introduced the technology after receiving dozens of complaints that some of its streets were becoming a â€œmagnet for Lamborghinis and Ferrarisâ€�. More than 100 people were issued with warnings in only two weeks after the introduction of the first noise cameras brought in to tackle antisocial supercar drivers. The devices detect when a 74-decibel noise threshold is exceeded and record the offending vehicleâ€™s numberplate. Drivers are warned that a second offence will lead to a fine. In the first 11 days of operation, the cameras were activated 130 times, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. The loudest recorded sound was 104dB â€“ equivalent to a helicopter flying nearby.
Johnny Thalassites, Kensingtonâ€™s lead member for transport, said: â€œResidents have had enough of drivers using our streets as a racetrack. â€œSupercars look good and most drivers are considerate but when theyâ€™re not, it is disruptive and irritating for people living and working in the area.â€�
Drivers face fines of between Â£100 and Â£2,500, and persistent offenders may have their vehicles seized. In third place is Cheshire, with 296 supercars. The area, known as the â€œGolden Triangleâ€�, is home to some of the worldâ€™s most famous footballers. Elmbridge, in Surrey, which has been dubbed the â€œBeverly Hills of Britainâ€�, takes the number four spot, with 236 supercars. Many celebrities and sportspeople live in the area. The private St Georgeâ€™s Hill estate popular with overseas billionaires is also in included in the district. In Scotland, Edinburgh has the highest concentration of supercars, with a total of 89.
The number of new supercars registered in 2020 is expected to dip slightly because of the coronavirus pandemic but the number of secondhand sales could rise. HR Owen, Britainâ€™s biggest luxury car dealership, said it had noticed an uptick in secondhand supercar sales as the wealthy splashed cash that might have otherwise been spent on exotic holidays curtailed by lockdowns. HR Owen sold 1,058 cars in its latest financial year to July 2020, down from 1,646, according to filings at Companies House, but secondhand sales increased slightly. The company recorded sales of Â£389m, down from Â£532m a year earlier. Pretax profits dropped from Â£8.3m to Â£1.9m."
2021-02-01T06:00:01Z,business,Business,Plans for London's biggest music venue face local opposition,"Coronavirus has pulled the plug on the live music business, and scientists are warning physical distancing restrictions may have to continue until Christmas, but one entertainment company is pushing ahead with plans to build a gigantic concert venue in London. The US’s Madison Square Garden Company (MSG) – which owns the New York concert and sports venue – is planning to upstage the Millennium Dome with a globe-shaped structure called the MSG Sphere. In the face of opposition from local people, the project is awaiting planning approval for a site in Stratford, just north of the dome, also known as the O2 Arena. The enormous building, measuring over 90 metres high and 120 metres wide, would contain a nightclub, bars, restaurants and shops, as well as a concert hall, which could welcome 21,500 people. This would make the Sphere bigger than any of the UK’s current concert venues, including the 21,000-capacity Manchester Arena, and the O2 Arena itself, which can hold 20,000. The Sphere is just one example of how the UK’s multibillion-pound live music industry is banking on a comeback in 2021. But smaller operators will need help. Event organisers have warned that this summer’s music festivals will not be able to take place without government support. Glastonbury festival, which takes place in June and attracts about 210,000 people, has been cancelled for the second year running. A key demand from organisers is for a government-based indemnity scheme that operates like a form of insurance by providing financial support if festivals are affected by coronavirus, similar to a €2.5bn (£2.3bn) event cancellation fund launched by the German government. It may take more than government support to restart live events. Scientists on the government’s scientific advisory group Sage have reportedly warned ministers that unless the Covid-19 jabs are highly effective at giving immunity from the disease, social distancing measures will have to remain in place for months in order to avoid a third spike in deaths. Chris Carey, a music industry economist, believes the development of another arena-sized venue would be good news for music fans in London and further afield. “An additional space for people to play could stimulate demand without having to raise prices,” he said. MSG’s plans for the London Sphere predate the pandemic, but the company has faced other headwinds: local people are concerned about a new venue on their doorstep. MSG has underlined its commitment to transforming “a long abandoned and unproductive site in east London into a state-of-the-art entertainment venue”.
The US group is building its first Sphere in Las Vegas, although construction has been delayed by Covid-19, and it hopes to expand the concept globally. While the project does have some local backing, worried residents fear that a building suitable for “Sin City” does not belong in a densely populated part of the capital. As a result, many have joined forces to try to block the development through a group called Stop MSG Sphere. Won over by the promise of panoramic views over the rooftops of east London, Nick Kompas decided at the start of January 2016 to purchase an apartment on the 21st floor of a residential high-rise which was under construction. Yet for most of the two years he has lived in Legacy Tower, the 39-year-old software engineer has worried that those city scenes will be blocked by the Sphere complex, which would dominate the view from his home. If the proposed development is greenlit, the completed building – directly opposite Kompas’s home – would be almost as tall as Big Ben, and covered with LED panels, programmed to display videos or adverts. “This structure will be like living next to the surface of the sun,” said Kompas. “It is a nightmare scenario. It is not just the biggest billboard on the planet, it is going to have video, it is going to have moving, strobing lights.” However, MSG has said the digital display will be switched off from midnight until early morning.
Kompas said he and many other Legacy Tower residents had already moved in when MSG first submitted its planning application in March 2019. Residents and the company are now waiting for the authority, the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), to make its decision in the first three months of the year. MSG plans to build on a triangular strip of land, close to the Olympic Park and next to the Westfield shopping centre, which was used as a coach park during the 2012 London Games. The US company set out its plans for the Sphere, which it calls “next generation” and “the world’s most advanced entertainment venue”, long before the pandemic halted large-scale live events. The planning application process has been delayed, and MSG has been sent back to the drawing board several times by the LLDC. There are now more than 2,000 documents associated with the application. The LLDC’s planning committee is due to make a decision about the Sphere in the first quarter of the year. However, as is standard with major planning decisions, its verdict will be referred to the mayor of London. Local councils, including Newham, where the Sphere would be built, as well as West Ham MP Lyn Brown oppose the plans. Rival entertainment group AEG, which owns the O2 Arena, located on the Thames approximately four miles south of Stratford, has also laid out its objections to the Sphere on the proposed site. Concerned local people fear the disruption during the projected three years of construction, and thereafter the pollution and increased traffic from visitors to the arena, which is expected to operate 300 days a year. Brown wrote of her concerns for her constituency in a letter to the LLDC, stressing that “the presence of bright lights until after midnight on some days, and beginning again at 6am on some mornings, clearly has the potential to impact on health and wellbeing for residents living nearby”. The area has been home to much construction since it hosted the Olympics, and blocks of flats are still being built. MSG insists the venue will bring economic benefits and jobs to this area of the capital. The company asked accountancy firm EY to analyse the economic benefits of the venue for local businesses. EY calculated these would reach £50m a year once operational, while it forecast the Sphere would contribute £2.7bn to the UK economy in its first 20 years. The firm said that, once open, 3,200 people would be employed there, while 4,300 jobs would be created for its construction – and it has pledged to fill 35% of these roles with local people. AEG has raised concerns about how London’s public transport network would cope with clashing events at the O2 and the Sphere, with potentially 40,000 people trying to travel on the same underground line at the same time. “We have always said we are not opposed to competition in London, we do think there is an opportunity for another major venue in London, but we just don’t think it should be situated in this location,” said Alistair Wood, project director for real estate development at AEG Europe. AEG Europe is also banking on a live music revival following Covid. The group is involved in the £1.3bn redevelopment of the Olympia exhibition halls in west London by investors Yoo Capital and Deutsche Finance International, which will include a 4,400-capacity live music venue, as well as new hotels, shops and restaurants.
MSG Entertainment said: “London is one of the world’s leading cities for music and entertainment, but has been underserved by large indoor venues compared to other global destinations.” A rejection of its planning application would be a big setback for MSG, but the firm has insisted it is focused on building its second Sphere on the planned site in Stratford, and is not considering other locations elsewhere in the capital. Carey believes the planned investments will eventually bear fruit: “I see no reason why live music can’t get back to its prior level very quickly and grow at a pace from there as it has for the last decade.”"
2021-02-01T00:40:32Z,business,Business,ExxonMobil and Chevron held merger talks in 2020,"The chief executives of American oil companies ExxonMobil and Chevron held preliminary talks in early 2020 to explore combining the two largest US oil producers in what would have been the biggest merger of all time, according to people familiar with the matter. The discussions, which are no longer ongoing, are being seen as having tested the waters for the huge corporate marriage after the coronavirus pandemic shook the world last year, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. Such consequential discussions are indicative of the pressure the energy sector’s most dominant companies faced as Covid-19 took hold and crude prices plunged. The talks between Exxon chief executive, Darren Woods, and Chevron CEO, Mike Wirth, were serious enough for legal documents involving certain aspects of the merger discussions to be drafted, one of the sources told Reuters. Sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Exxon and Chevron, which have market capitalizations of $190bn and $164bn, respectively, declined to comment on Sunday. The discussions were described as preliminary and although were not ongoing could come back in the future. Such a deal would reunite the two largest descendants of John D Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly, which was broken up by US regulators in 1911, and reshaped the oil industry, the Journal reported.
A combined company’s market value could top $350bn, creating the world’s second largest oil company by market capitalization and production, second only to Saudi Arabia’s state oil producer, Aramco. Such a big American oil merger could run into regulatory and antitrust hurdles in the new Biden , which has taken the US back into the Paris climate accords. Last week Biden signed new environmental orders, saying the climate crisis was an existential threat demanding urgent remedies and introduced his team, including former secretary of state John Kerry as the new US climate global envoy. During the election campaign last October, Biden said he would push the US to “transition away from the oil industry”. One of the people familiar with the talks told the Journal the sides may have missed an opportunity to consummate the deal under the former president, Donald Trump, who withdrew rom the Paris agreement and had a powerful relationship with the fossil fuel industries."
2021-01-31T20:01:16Z,business,Business,UK rail union threatens industrial action if pay is frozen for two years,"The UK’s best-known rail union has said it will have “no hesitation” in supporting industrial action if ministers press ahead with reported plans for a two-year pay freeze for rail workers. Transport minister Chris Heaton-Harris is understood to have written to the bosses of the UK’s 22 passenger rail companies warning that there is no budget to increase wages for their 62,000 workers. In the letter he said the subsidies being pumped into the industry were “not sustainable”. Passenger numbers have fallen to around 15% of what would normally be expected, causing a huge drop in revenues. Rail companies were effectively nationalised last March when franchises were suspended. The rescue deal was extended in October, when emergency recovery contracts were agreed with rail operators ranging from six to 18 months. Official estimates said the taxpayer bailout of the railways will exceed £10bn in the year to April, and ministers and rail bosses appear to have accepted that the two-year pay freeze is an inevitable consequence of the position that the industry finds itself in. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, announced a public sector pay freeze last November with the exception of NHS workers. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, reacted with anger to the news. “Transport workers who are risking their lives keeping our country moving have found out they have been stabbed in the back by the government who have extended the public sector pay freeze to the transport sector. At the same time it’s business as usual for the private companies who will continue to be able to rake in profits. “RMT will have no hesitation in supporting national coordinated action to deliver our members the pay rise they deserve,” he warned. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said the government had come up with an unprecedented support package to keep services running and protect frontline jobs. “It would be unfair to increase the burden on taxpayers by funding rail industry pay rises, and we would only consider increases in exceptional circumstances. We are immensely grateful to everyone that has worked so hard to keep the railway running, but our focus must be protecting jobs, services and taxpayers through this unprecedented period,” he said.
The Rail Delivery Group, which represents the train operating companies, said it was “to be expected” that the government was examining all options to ensure the railway was financially sustainable. “We recognise the huge contribution that our people have made in keeping workers moving during the pandemic and our priority is ensuring the railway is well positioned to catalyse the future recovery of our local communities,” it said in a statement. Like other key workers, train staff have faced a tough year, despite the drop in passenger numbers. In January Great Western Railway was forced to cut planned train services after a number of staff contracted Covid. Other rail firms have suffered similar problems over the last 12 months."
2021-01-31T15:20:05Z,business,Business,"Negative interest rates would not help Covid economy, Bank of England told","Cutting the UK’s official interest rate below zero would fail to boost Britain’s Covid-stricken economy because lenders would increase mortgage costs in response, the Bank of England has been told. The leading representative of Britain’s building societies said high street lenders were not in a position to handle negative interest rates, had computer systems that were ill-equipped and that the move would be counterproductive for the British economy.
Mike Regnier, the chief executive of Yorkshire building society and the chairman of the Building Societies Association, said negative rates would lead big high street lenders to push up their mortgage rates to protect profitability – hurting consumers and the wider economy. “I fear this would have the opposite effect from supporting the economy, as rates would go up for borrowers as banks protect their margins,” he told the Guardian. Threadneedle Street will on Thursday reveal the findings from its work to assess the UK’s readiness for negative interest rates, as it considers ways to boost the economy amid the intensifying fallout from Covid-19. Negative rates would involve charging commercial banks and building societies to deposit funds at the central bank – with the aim of encouraging additional lending and cheaper borrowing costs. The Bank of England wrote to all banks and building societies in October to check whether they could pass on negative interest rates if the central bank cut the cost of borrowing below the current base rate of 0.1%. Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s governor, has argued that the policy is in the Bank’s “toolbox” for boosting the economy but has played down its use in the short-term. However, Regnier said lenders were far from ready, and questioned whether such a move would achieve its stated aims. “I really don’t think negative rates are a good idea. Obviously, it’s not up to me, it’s up to the Bank. But there are a number of things that would make it very challenging.” Banks and building societies make profits by charging a higher rate of interest to borrowers than they do to savers, and it is believed negative rates would lead to a narrowing of this “spread”. This would hit profits, which industry leaders have warned would undermine the viability of banks and threaten financial stability. When Threadneedle Street cuts its interest rate, banks typically lower their deposit rates and lending rates in response. However, Regnier said banks would not want to charge consumers negative interest – meaning they would instead need to drive up lending rates to protect their margins. “I can’t see a scenario where we’d charge our retail savers to leave their deposits with us,” he said. “Banks would need to protect their net interest margins. If they can’t pass the rate cut through to their savers, they have to put rates up for borrowers, and that defeats the object of a rates cut.” With savings rates for consumers plunging to rock-bottom levels, Yorkshire building society is investing £20m to increase the rates it offers. More than 1.3 million members will benefit from the changes, which take effect from Friday and will push its average savings rate from 0.17% to about 0.23%.
As well as affecting savers and borrowers, Britain’s biggest banks would need to update their computer systems to handle a move into negative rates. This includes banks such as NatWest Group, which has an IT system that would not recognise a negative interest rate. Sam Woods, the Bank of England’s deputy governor, said earlier this month it was looking at whether there was a “Y2K-type issue” across the industry that would make it harder to plunge rates below zero. Regnier said the Yorkshire would need to take similar steps but that Threadneedle Street had not told it such an investment was necessary yet. “They’re not asking banks and building societies at the moment to make the investment. They’re in the process of working out what it would take. “They said they’d give us notice, and at the moment they haven’t yet given that formal notice to make what is a fairly significant investment across the industry.”"
2021-01-31T12:16:51Z,business,Business,"EU Covid incompetence leaves governments wanting vaccines, not excuses | Larry Elliott","The EU has made an almighty hash of procuring treatments for Covid-19. Vaccine centres are running short of supplies as a result. National governments want jabs rather than excuses for what has gone wrong. The search for scapegoats is on. Stripped of the legal wrangling between Brussels and AstraZeneca, the protectionist plan to ban exports of drugs and the now-abandoned plan to close the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, the EU has been incompetent – and no amount of bully-boy tactics can get away from that fact.
About 12% of people in the UK have been vaccinated against 2% in the EU – a huge difference. The German newspaper Die Zeit summed up the anger at bungling that will be costly in lives and livelihoods with a simple statement: “The best advertisement for Brexit.” That’s quite a turnaround from the “plague island” jibes aimed at the UK a few weeks ago but understandable, given the way the European commission has engineered the sort of centrally planned cock-up redolent of the Soviet Union in its sunset years, even down to the apparatchiks desperately hunting around for a factory manager they can blame for a fiasco of their own making. Yet anybody in the UK tempted to gloat at the EU’s stuttering vaccine programme should think again. The death of a German or Italian pensioner from Covid-19 is every bit as sad as the death of a British pensioner. What’s more, the consequence of having so few people vaccinated is that the fear factor will remain high in the EU, making it harder for governments to ease physical-distancing rules and making people far more cautious. Economic recovery will be delayed and that is in no one’s interest. The sooner the EU closes the vaccination gap with the UK the better. It has to be said, though, that this wasn’t quite what was expected. The UK government took a lot of stick last summer when it announced that it would not participate in the EU scheme to procure vaccines collectively. Britain, it was said, would have to wait for its jabs while the rest of Europe received speedier protection. The subtext was that the government was allowing Brexit ideology to interfere with public health. The headline in this paper was: “UK plan to shun EU vaccine scheme “unforgivable”, say critics.”
To be fair, that was perhaps a reasonable expectation, given the government’s underwhelming record on providing PPE and delivering an effective test, trace and isolate system. It was also assumed that Brussels would be able to strike better deals with the pharmaceutical companies because it was buying in bulk. But what really mattered was not price but speed and breadth of supply. Britain’s approach was to sign contracts early with lots of pharma companies hoping that some of them would turn out to be effective. Had they been left to their own devices, that would have been the preferred option of other European countries, including Germany, France and Italy, which could have signed contracts on the same terms as those struck by the UK. Instead, EU member states were leaned upon by Brussels to support a collective endeavour, which delayed the placing of orders for the AstraZeneca vaccine by three months. Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca’s chief executive, says the UK’s three-month head start was important because it allowed glitches in the production process to be sorted out. It was not until the autumn that the EU placed orders for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (even though the breakthrough was made in a German lab) and even later before it got round to ordering some of the Moderna vaccine. Last Friday, the pharma company Novavax said it had developed a vaccine that was effective against Covid-19. The UK has pre-ordered 60m doses: the EU none. The approach adopted by the commission was designed to show Europe’s solidarity in the face of the crisis but has had the opposite effect. Individual countries – trying to explain to their irate populations why vaccine centres have run out of drugs – now wish they had gone their own way. Some, such as Hungary, have actually done so, with the government in Budapest putting in an order for the Russian Sputnik vaccine. As with all major screw-ups, there are lessons to be learned. One is the importance of having sufficient domestic capacity to satisfy demand for vaccines. Britain is fortunate that pharma is one sector of manufacturing where it retains a world-class presence. The speed at which AstraZeneca produced the vaccine demonstrates the merits of collaboration between academia and business, and the merits of having an industrial strategy. Nurturing fledgling biotech companies makes even more sense now than it did a year ago.
A second is that procurement matters. Strictly speaking, there was nothing to prevent Germany or France from adopting the UK approach but they felt obliged to support the centralised approach adopted by Brussels. Having the freedom to do things differently paid off. Regulation also matters. Britain got its vaccine programme going more quickly because it approved the drugs sooner. EU regulation doesn’t necessarily mean better regulation. Sometimes there are advantages in doing things your own way and this is one of them. Despite what Die Zeit says, it is unlikely that any other EU country will opt for its own version of Brexit. That said, people in Germany might like to ask a couple of simple questions: would we rather have health policy run by our own government or by the people in Brussels? And would we rather have life or death decisions taken by people we can vote out of power or by an unelected body where nobody ever has to take responsibility for even the most colossal and humiliating of failures?"
2021-01-31T12:00:36Z,business,Business,"Entrepreneurs are great, but it’s mom and dad who gave them their start","What do Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk really have in common? Sure, they’re all tech billionaires, super smart people, savvy innovators and successful entrepreneurs. But there’s another thing: they all had families who helped them at the very beginning. Bill Gates’s mom introduced him to executives at IBM, which helped him forge a deal for his first operating system MS-DOS. Bezos’s parents were early investors in Amazon. Musk comes from a wealthy, South African background. Among other well-known entrepreneurs, Mark Zuckerberg reportedly took a $100,000 loan from his father to start Facebook. Michael Dell’s parents offered some seed money for his fledging computer business. Nike founder Phil Knight credits his parents for helping him start the company too. All of these men came from upper-middle-class families and of course none of them owe their success entirely to mom and dad. But without their parents’ help, be it financial or otherwise, who knows where they – or the world – would be today? Family money and background plays a critical role when it comes to starting up a business. In fact, it’s one of the primary sources of funding for startups, well ahead of other options like bank loans and venture capital. And the more money mom and dad have, the better. A new study confirms this. “There is a strong connection between your parent’s income and your chances of becoming a startup entrepreneur, with those from a strong financial background having a higher chance of becoming entrepreneurs,” said Shira Greenberg, the chief economist Israel’s ministry of finance, in a recent report conducted by his agency and reported by the Jerusalem Post. The study – which used demographic, academic and financial data from Israeli entrepreneurs between the ages of 25 and 35 and their families – found that the income of an entrepreneur’s parents was the most important factor towards the likelihood of starting up a business. “Having strong financial support can help someone who is interested in setting up a startup and providing a financial safety net in the case of failure,” the report said. The Israeli study correlates to the 2013 findings of University of California, Berkeley economists Ross Levine and Rona Rubenstein, who looked at the shared traits of entrepreneurs and found that most were white, male, and highly educated. “If one does not have money in the form of a family with money, the chances of becoming an entrepreneur drop quite a bit,” Levine told Quartz. And even though having money is important, it’s not all that. It’s the family environment that has a big impact on the startup entrepreneur. According to the Jerusalem Post’s report on the study, there was “a significant connection between the parents’ level of education and entrepreneurship” and “that connection is even stronger if the parents studied science or technology”. The study did not find a difference if this impetus came from either the father or mother, as long as it was there. Being intelligent wasn’t a factor either. The Israeli study found that even those that scored lower on mathematic achievement tests but came from a family with higher income and wealth had more of a chance becoming an entrepreneur. Obviously, none of this necessarily translates into success. There’s a difference between starting a business and actually making it profitable and valuable. Bezos, Gates, Musk and all the other billionaires who got help from their parents took advantage of that help and then used their brains, work ethic – and a little luck – to build great companies. But none of this would have happened if they didn’t at least start somewhere. Governments can offer tax breaks, grants and special loans. Non-profits can provide assistance to fledging entrepreneurs. Big companies can make strategic investments. But in the end, one of the most important factors – if not the most important – for entrepreneurship is mom and dad. Come to think of it, doesn’t that account for a lot of other things too?"
2021-01-31T09:00:33Z,business,Business,Retail is at death’s door – and tinkering with business rates won’t save it,"The coronavirus pandemic has meant a brutal period for high street retailers, many of which were struggling before last spring as more and more consumer sales moved online. This trend was particularly noticeable last week with the rescue deals brokered for the stable of brands owned by Arcadia, Sir Philip Green’s bust fashion group, and for ailing department store chain Debenhams. In both cases there was zero appetite from the buyers to take on any of the groups’ combined estate of more than 500 shops. Instead these major high street presences look destined to become just websites, shorn of their stores and their large workforces. It is a stark illustration of the industry’s tilt towards the web, accelerated by the pandemic, and of a bleak future for jobs in what is still the UK’s biggest private employment sector.
Around 25,000 people are likely to lose their jobs as a result of the failure of Arcadia and Debenhams, and while online groups are expanding – Boohoo is opening a warehouse in Wellingborough with 1,000 jobs – the online model requires far fewer employees than do sprawling department stores. There will be the physical scars too: between them, according adviser Altus Group, Debenhams and Arcadia occupied 1.4m square feet of retail space – the equivalent of 194 Premier League football pitches. That means even more gaping holes in high streets and shopping centres that landlords will struggle to fill, not least given the impact of the pandemic on the bars and restaurants that had previously been eager to occupy the spaces vacated by retreating retailers. No one is pretending that Debenhams and Arcadia, with their tails of also-ran fashion brands, are the best the UK high street has to offer. Both suffered from a lack of investment and of management vision. There are, after all, obvious examples of strong high street store-based players – such as no frills chain Primark, where shoppers queue up to get their hands on low-price clothing and homewares. Even before anyone had even heard of Covid-19, a painful restructuring of the retail industry was in progress as home shopping grew in stature and out-of-kilter rents and business rates tipped the scales against big store estates. The pandemic has accelerated this Darwinian process and the fallout in job losses and empty stores will be frightening in the short term, even if renewal is possible further down the line. Over the past two years, according to the British Retail Consortium, one in every 50 shops has permanently closed, and without intervention at this desperate hour, it argues, this number will “only go up”. There are big issues that need to be resolved if high streets are to recover from these worst of times. The crisis has brought about a much-needed reset of rents, but what of business rates, currently on hold as part of the government’s emergency business support measures? If the owners of Arcadia and Debenhams’ stores can’t find new tenants, they will be on the hook for a £141m bill. Can’t the government think of a way to better to tax booming internet businesses? If unnecessary shop closures and job losses are to be avoided, business rates relief will at the very least have to be extended beyond April (as has already happened in Scotland). Let’s face it, non-essential shops have been closed since Christmas and may not even be open by the time their bills for 2021 land. Rates have been reviewed to death by the government: retailers are still in suspense as to the outcome of its current “fundamental review”. But now it has run out of road. Physical retail is dying and without action now more store-based retailers will disappear, making any recovery harder to achieve. Spread the word: even macho bankers have mental health issues There is a tendency to discount almost anything a banker might say about their workplace and how stressful it can be. The sky-high pay, the big house, the holidays in Dubai and the personal assistants all militate against any form of sympathy. This reaction should be set aside. The pandemic has damaged the mental health of millions, be it from the death of a relative, the monotony and restrictions of lockdown or the long hours many have had to put in, often to save their businesses from going under. Tom Blomfield, the founder and former chief executive of online bank Monzo, said this weekend that he was struck down by anxiety as investors pulled support and customers stopped spending in the early weeks of the first lockdown. Blomfield was already stressed when the pandemic hit, but the pressure he faced in the weeks after the first lockdown was so intense he had to take a step back. First he surrendered his chief executive role to become president, then he quit the company altogether. He joins a list already including Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the former Virgin bank boss, and António Horta-Osório, chief executive of Lloyds, who have also publicly told of their battles with stress and anxiety. Three lockdowns have had a major impact on the mental health of many in the UK. Among a welter of figures showing rising anxiety levels, Glasgow University research found that during the first lockdown, one in four respondents reported at least moderate symptoms of depression. Banking is a macho industry that finally looks as though it is addressing the need for cultural reform. The hope must be that hearing about the difficulties of top bosses will encourage other directors to review how they manage their own wellbeing – and that of their staff. How long will Kwarteng’s stand on workers’ rights last? There should be praise for a Conservative minister who openly rejects his youthful dalliance with crude free-market policies. Is Kwasi Kwarteng deserving of such praise? Having contributed to a 2012 collection of essays that called for a bonfire of regulations and branded British workers “idlers”, he appears to have broken with his past. After his recent promotion to the cabinet, Kwarteng found himself in charge of a controversial plan to downgrade EU employment protections, a plan apparently inherited from his predecessor as business secretary, Alok Sharma. The plan is understood to have included proposals to end the 48-hour maximum working week and remove overtime earnings from calculations for certain holiday pay entitlements. The response from Labour and the unions to any prospect of weaker protections for workers was immediate. They said it was an outrageous move in the middle of a pandemic, when so many were either on furlough and in fear for their jobs or being overworked by employers looking to survive the pandemic. Last week, the secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy announced that the plan had been axed, saying: “I made it very, very clear to officials in the department that we’re not interested in watering down workers’ rights.” It is a U-turn that this newspaper had foreseen. Those in the cabinet who argued for the axing of the plan will have focused on the likely reaction from Tory MPs freshly elected to so-called red wall seats. The many Brexit voters in these constituencies didn’t vote to leave the EU only for the government to hand their employers a bigger whip to beat them with. There is a worry, though. Kwarteng is still aligned with a sizable group of free-marketeers in the cabinet. And when the pandemic crisis has eased, they will without doubt once again press their case for deregulation. When it comes to preserving workers’ rights, this is a skirmish in a longer war."
2021-01-31T07:00:31Z,business,Business,'A lost history': the US women who fought for better working conditions,"In the early 1970s, a group of female clerical workers in Boston, Massachusetts, began organizing for better wages, advancement opportunities, and an end to sexual harassment. Their organizing efforts spurred a nationwide movement called 9to5, formed to improve working conditions for women across the board, and eventually toward the goal of forming unions within the workplace.
A new documentary film on the 9to5 movement from the Academy Award-winning film-makers of American Factory premieres 1 February on PBS, and the makers believe the movement has many echoes of today’s social justice movements from #MeToo and Black Lives Matter. Women’s participation in the workforce climbed from 33.9% in 1950 to about 51.5% in 1980. As more women began entering the workforce, they faced glaring pay inequities, rampant gender discrimination, pregnancy discrimination and sexual harassment. The film, featuring interviews with leading organizers of the movement and actor Jane Fonda, who starred in and helped develop the 1980 film 9 to 5 with Dolly Parton and Lily Tomlin, explores the history behind the movement that inspired the Hollywood film, its successes, losses, and parallels to the ongoing struggles in the labor movement and for women’s rights today.
“Women had so few opportunities that working-class women and middle-class women found themselves with the same problems in the same workplaces. We were able to bring people together across class, make sure that we were confronting divisions around race by bringing people together and finding common cause. And it worked,” said Karen Nussbaum, co-founder and director of 9to5. From Boston, 9to5 grew to cities around the US, creating a space for women and women’s issues in the labor movement in tandem with the women’s liberation movement occurring in the same era. Rallying cries of “Raises not roses”, “coffee rebellions” and picketing actions spread to cities like Chicago, Atlanta, Cleveland, New York City, San Francisco and Seattle. Local chapters ran campaigns targeted at employers and directed toward issues such as securing promotions and hiring opportunities for women workers, healthcare benefits, pay raises, childcare, receiving back pay, and organizing women around collective issues impacting them in the workplace. “It’s a lost history,” said film-maker Julia Reichert. “We started making this film long before we made American Factory. We didn’t realize the two films were going to end up talking to each other so much. For instance, the [American Factory] union drive was clearly defeated because plenty of workers were fired, and there were those huge mandatory meetings where workers were told unions were bad again and again. That all started in the 9to5 movement in the late 1970s and 80s.” During the 1970s and 1980s, union avoidance developed into a multimillion-dollar industry as consultants and lawyers actively pursued employers to utilize their services. According to a 2019 report by the Economic Policy Institute, US companies spend nearly $340m a year on union avoidance advisers. In part as a result of the corporate backlash toward the labor movement, the union membership rate of the US workforce drastically declined over the past 50 years, from 20.1% in 1983 to 11.1% in 2015, driven primarily by union losses within the private sector. “Whenever these votes occur, you might hear about a union drive and that the workers chose not to have the union. I feel a lot of people don’t get the kind of pressure workers are under from their boss, who pays their paychecks, stopping them from voting ‘yes’,” said film-maker Steven Bognar. Organizers with the 9to5 movement formed a local within the Service Employees International Union, Local 925, in the early 1980s. Through their organizing efforts, workers experienced union election victories, but also suffered defeats at the hands of well-funded, aggressive anti-union campaigns where consultants utilized captive audience meetings, fear, and intimidation to suppress unionization efforts.
“Everyone should know that there is an opportunity to do collective bargaining, working together so that they can have better decision making, make more money, have better outcomes, and better benefits,” said Mary Jung, a 9to5 organizer and activist in Cleveland, Ohio, in the 1970s. “It’s all about that one-on-one contact, how you approach people, how you’re inclusive, how you try to build an organization, and you just really need people to meet others where they’re at and see and show them where they can go.” Co-founder of 9to5, Karen Nussbaum noted the political and social conditions that enabled the rise of the 9to5 movement in the 1970s is similar to the political and social turmoil the US has recently experienced, from economic recessions to the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements. The new administration under Joe Biden has begun to take steps toward enacting a $15 minimum wage and reforming labor laws to facilitate workers to organize unions as public approval of labor unions is at the highest rate since the 1960s, at 65%, according to the latest Gallup poll, conducted in August 2020. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the unionization rate of the US workforce increased from 11.6% to 12.1% due to the job security protections afforded to workers who belong to a union. The decline in union membership over the past few decades has directly correlated to surges in income inequality, as increasing shares of income has been directed to the top 10% of wealthiest Americans. After securing a slim majority in the senate, the Democratic party now has the ability, if they eliminate the filibuster, to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which passed in the House in 2019 but did not reach a vote in the then Republican-led Senate. The legislation would expand worker protections in forming unions, including raising penalties for firing workers in retaliation for union organizing and banning captive anti-union meetings in the workplace. Aside from labor law reforms, Nussbaum explained worker-led organizations and unions need to partner together to organize to create the change similar to what 9to5 was able to achieve and continue to build on it. “Unions and the new worker organizations need to have the kind of partnership that we did,” Nussbaum said. “No amount of foundation money is going to substitute for organizations that working people own themselves. And if we don’t have that, we’ll never have the power that we need to really be a counterbalance to the better corporate power that we have right now.”"
2021-01-30T19:00:18Z,business,Business,Morrison wants to bask in the post-pandemic glow. Expect an election this year | Greg Jericho,"Right now everyone connected to the federal political sphere is preparing for an election this year – most likely August or September. The last possible date for the usual half-Senate/House of Representatives election is 21 May 2022, but no one thinks that is at all likely, regardless of Scott Morrison’s statement last year that he is a “full-termer”. It is why Anthony Albanese announced the shadow ministry reshuffle this week. Given few people can name any shadow minister, such changes are unlikely to have much impact, but there’s no point holding back when this year is likely to be a long sprint to the finish line. You can float all manner of reasons why the government might go to the polls this year rather than next but most are to do with the pandemic and the economy – and how both will look next year compared with now.
This week the IMF released its latest economic update, which includes projections for growth this year and next. The good news is it has revised up Australia’s growth figures for this year by 0.5% points, to 3.5%. That’s pretty solid, if not stellar, growth. It would be the best year since 2012, but nothing that would have people recalling the heady years of the early 2000s mining boom. But then comes 2022. The IMF projects growth will slow to 2.9%, which if we are generous we will call “average”, but it will be barely enough to lower the unemployment rate – meaning it will likely remain above 6%.
It’s not the stuff that is going to have people thinking we have “snapped back”; more it might serve to remind people just how weak the economy was before the pandemic came along. This year the vaccine, the lack of shutdowns, and just the general sense that nothing can be as bad as last year, will give the government an easier product to sell. There will be strong growth, both in jobs and other indicators, purely because last year was terrible. Donald Trump tried this on a bit by bragging about record growth levels last year. Of course he didn’t win, but the false sense that comes from comparing things with the worst of times did at least give him a pitch that he had the nation heading in a good direction.
Fortunately for Joe Biden, Trump was incapable of sticking to the script and continually undermined the message, but Morrison will not be so kind to the ALP. Morrison, unlike Trump, has been able to ride on the backs of the states. The ALP will claim the Morrison government failed during the pandemic to take responsibility of aged care and aspects of international quarantine, and that it had to be dragged to the table to agree to policies such as the wage subsidy that became jobkeeper. But when you have processes as purposely opaque as is the national cabinet, there is more than enough room for politicians to claim credit and deflect blame. And even better for the government, the pandemic has wiped away most memories of Morrison’s failures during last year’s bushfires. But by 2022, the pandemic will be further in the background and the excuses and willingness to forgive certain levels of unemployment, stagnant wage growth and lack of overall economic strength will fade. People like things being back to normal, but the last thing the government wants is for voters to realise that what was normal before the pandemic was not very good. The ALP remains relatively even with the Coalition in the polls (such as they matter). That itself is quite stunning, given a crisis like the pandemic naturally has people defaulting to the incumbent (so long as they don’t completely screw up). The problem for the ALP is that since the second world war no opposition has ever won a close election – for a swing to change government it has always needed to be a big one. Another year would give Labor more time to build up some momentum, while increasing the risk that the government’s pitch of a strong recovery seems less true. All of which makes an election this year more likely than not."
2021-01-30T17:00:13Z,business,Business,Rishi Sunak may be trapped between the wings of his own party,"Time is short as the chancellor tries to devise a coherent package for his budget on 3 March. Already it looks like being an impossible task. In the same way as the Conservative party is at odds over how to tackle the pandemic, it also cannot decide on what direction to take when the vaccine – maybe by as early as the summer – begins to clear the economic fog. To say that there are competing agendas would be to put this budget in the same category as all its predecessors. Rishi Sunak must wish that were the case. This one will be different because the pandemic, the climate emergency and Brexit mean the intensity of rival claims on Treasury funds will be more akin to the early 1980s and the internal battle between one-nation Tories and their free-market adversaries. When he stands up in the Commons to deliver the first fully fledged non-emergency budget of this parliament, one of Sunak’s main messages will be that he wants to protect existing jobs through the pandemic and also give extra depth to state-funded programmes that create new ones. An increase in unemployment to about 7%, predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility in its latest outlook, is short of the 10-12% it forecast in the depths of the first lockdown. Yet that rise would still create up to 2.3 million officially unemployed workers, and many more uncounted jobless. While state funding is expanded, free-market supporters who argue that job creation should be left to the private sector must be placated. They will receive promises of contracts to private-sector companies. Tax cuts for startup businesses and investment incentives are also likely to be offered to keep a powerful body of cabinet ministers – Michael Gove, Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng among them – from rebelling. A green tech revolution is promised, one that puts the UK at the forefront of tackling the climate emergency before the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow later this year. Meanwhile, Sunak will devote huge sums to the pet projects of backbench Tory MPs who obsess about road-widening schemes and lobby for the infrastructure needed to build homes on flood plains. The NHS, schools and the police are already in line to receive more cash following last year’s public spending review. But those who favour limits on local authority spending will cheer the return of austerity in every other area of council activity.
And free-market cabinet ministers and their backbench supporters don’t mind adhering to the sacred promises of free education and healthcare at the point of use, if the state funding for them can be hoovered up by privately run service providers. That too will continue. Can Sunak afford to appease both camps when the debate turns to other subjects, such as “levelling up” the north, supporting the economies of devolved nations and helping exporters hit by a chaotic Brexit? Not when he claims the budget will also be mindful of the UK’s growing debts. We won’t know until budget day how low Sunak’s debt ceiling will be and, as a consequence, how much room he will leave himself over the next four years for spending. It seems he will ignore the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund and the OECD, which have made it clear they believe those countries that can expand their borrowing should do so, to lift not only their own economies, but the economies of those around them. These organisations say with confidence that interest rates will stay low for several years and so will inflation – and that even if they don’t, the UK has a central bank that can step in to make up the difference. If the Treasury limits its financial room for manoeuvre and insists on pleasing all sides, its spending will be both incoherent and lack the necessary power to reform any aspect of the UK economy. An opportunity to persuade the public that a break with the past is needed will have been lost. Once again, the government’s rhetoric will sound disconnected from policies that resemble a collection of peashooters where bazookas are required. Boris Johnson is an inveterate crowd-pleaser. This year we have seen that Sunak too looks like he is trapped by the desire to satisfy both wings of his party, even if he leans towards toward the free-marketers and their small-state agenda. The chancellor may think arbitrary borrowing limits put the public finances in a stronger position and, with them, his chances of succeeding Johnson one day. They don’t. They just undermine household and business confidence, and limit the recovery."
2021-01-30T16:00:12Z,business,Business,Does Robinhood owe too much to its rich backers?,"Robinhood is the amateurs’ share trading platform at the heart of the attempt by an army of small investors to outsmart Wall Street by buying shares in companies such as GameStop, costing hedge funds billions in the process. The company has upset the applecart of US stock investing by waiving the commission that traditional brokers charge customers to play the markets. That, plus its user-friendly app, has made trading much cheaper and easier for ordinary people, regardless of their experience, enticing more than 13 million users at the last count. Its name is a nod to the idea of helping the “poor” gatecrash the glamorous domain of rich traders, and it likes to style itself as drawing on the ethos of the Occupy Wall Street movement. In the words of its official rubric, Robinhood is “democratizing finance for all”. But this romanticised vision sits rather uncomfortably beside the reality of its origins and ownership. The app was founded in 2013 by Stanford University graduates and financial technology whiz-kids Baiju Bhatt and Vladimir Tenev. In a few short years, they have become paper billionaires, building the business into a steamroller success worth $8.6bn (£6.9bn), according to a recent funding round. Given that Robinhood doesn’t charge commission from its users, it has to make money some other way. It does that by charging fees to financial services companies, which pay for a steady stream of orders for trades made by the app’s users. While Robinhood facilitates the trades, it goes to “market maker” firms – typically large banks and financial institutions – who actually execute the transactions that keep the stock market moving. They profit by pocketing the difference – the “spread” – between the price people are willing to pay for stock and the price at which they’re willing to sell.
This funding model has raised questions about whether Robinhood is really worthy of the name. Is it looking out for its users, or for the same Wall Street investors it claims to help them bypass? One of the market makers that pays Robinhood for this “deal flow” is Citadel Securities, whose automated exchanges process 39% of all US listed share trades by volume. It was founded by the Wall Street tycoon Ken Griffin, whose stable also includes the Rumours reached fever pitch when Citadel LLC helped bail out Melvin Capital, a fellow hedge fund that Robinhood users were trying to punish for shorting GameStop. Citadel has denied that it put any pressure on Robinhood to suspend trading in GameStop and other firms, in response to a burgeoning belief that Wall Street had flexed its financial muscles to thwart a rebellion that was costing it money. That belief only gained strength when critics pointed out the hedge-fund contingent among Robinhood’s own backers. Sequoia Capital, a big beast of venture capital that led a $280m fundraising effort valuing Robinhood at $8.3bn in May 2020, has denied applying pressure. There may be no evidence behind the rumours, but if anyone were under any illusion about Robinhood’s links to high finance, they need only look at the names that helped it raise $1bn last week to help shore up its finances. JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Barclays are hardly what you’d think of as the prince of thieves’s merry men. There are other reasons to be cautious about Robinhood’s model: making trading easier has exposed people with little knowledge of finance to information they often don’t understand. On 12 June last year, a 20-year-old student, Alex Kearns, killed himself, believing that he had just lost $730,000 (£580,000) on Robinhood. The sum was actually a temporary position on an option – the kind of financial instrument that Robinhood users have been using to buy in to GameStop. When he died, he was actually $16,000 in the red. In a statement, Tenev and Bhatt said they had been “personally devastated by this tragedy”, and Robinhood promised to review the products that users were able to trade, and give them more information about what they were doing. But it came under intense pressure from US politicians and eventually cancelled its UK launch, planned for last summer."
2021-01-30T08:00:02Z,business,Business,Philip Green’s family likely to receive £50m from Topshop sale as creditors get 1%,"Sir Philip Green’s family is likely to receive £50m from the sale of Topshop while more than 1,000 suppliers to the high street fashion chain are set to get less than 1% of the money owed to them. A report by administrators into the collapse of Topshop and Topman seen by the Guardian reveals that the chains owed at least £51m to 1,155 unsecured creditors, who include clothing suppliers and landlords. This figure does not include monies owed to HMRC. Administrators at Deloitte said the final debts for Topshop were likely to be “materially higher” once tax and money potentially owed to the group’s pension fund are included. Unsecured creditors owed more than £1m include Daventry district council, for Topshop’s new distribution centre in the area, shopping centres including Liverpool One and Stratford City, and a number of clothing suppliers, including several in the UK and Turkey. At least 706 unsecured creditors to the six other chains in Green’s Arcadia Group fashion empire, which include Dorothy Perkins, Burton, Wallis, Outfit and Evans, are also owed at least £33m. These creditors are expected to receive at least some payout except those to Outfit, who are owed £252,000. All the chains’ debts are also likely to be far higher than the initial estimate which does not include money owed to HMRC. Administrators say unsecured creditors of Topshop’s main operating company as well as its property and distribution centre arms are “likely, on present information, to [receive] a distribution of less than 1p in the £1”. Creditors to the German arm are unlikely to receive any of the £1.8m that they are owed. As secured creditors, the Green family’s Aldsworth Equity, which is owed £50m relating to an interest-free loan it made to the group in 2019 at the time of an emergency restructure, will be paid before any funds are distributed to suppliers, landlords and HMRC. Administrators said the timing and amount paid to secured creditors would depend on the amount Topshop is sold for. Online specialist Asos is in talks about buying Topshop, Topman and Miss Selfridge with the deal expected to total more than £300m. Topshop’s parent company, another secured creditor, is set to receive £327.6m of the proceeds with up to £210m of that cash potentially set aside to pay down Arcadia’s pension deficit, which is estimated to be as much as £300m. Proceeds from the sale of Topshop’s London flagship store are also earmarked for the pension scheme, but it is not clear whether the property will fetch more than its £312m mortgage.
Administrators were called in last November after Arcadia suffered from poor trading and high costs. Topshop, the jewel in Arcadia’s crown which accounts for almost half the group’s sales, recorded a sales slide of 11% in 2019. Only Burton increased sales in the year to August 2019 while sales at Miss Selfridge dived by nearly a quarter. Administrators say turnover for Topshop “reduced dramatically” after the high street lockdown to control the Covid-19 pandemic came into force in March 2020. Arcadia agreed to defer contributions to its pension fund for six months from March to August last year. But it could not agree on a further deferral of the contributions, which amount to £25m a month. Attempts to raise £30m in cash to support the running of the business were also unsuccessful. • The headline of this article was amended on 2 February 2021 to replace the word “gain” with “receive” in relation to the £50m which, as secured creditors, Green’s family is likely to get from the sale of Topshop."
2021-01-30T07:00:01Z,business,Business,Lawyers disagree over AstraZeneca's duty to supply vaccines to EU,"The row between the EU and AstraZeneca showed no sign of subsiding on Friday, even as the European commission published the terms of the deal struck between the two for millions of doses of the firm’s Covid-19 vaccine. The commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, said it was “crystal clear” that the contract required AstraZeneca to deliver doses produced in the UK to the EU to make up for a shortfall in orders. But the firm has said this is not the case. “There’s an expression in German, which is our equivalent of ‘clear as mud’, which is ‘clear as noodle soup’. And that’s what I think this particular kerfuffle in the contract is. I think this is clear as noodle soup,” said James Turner QC, of Quadrant Chambers, who specialises in cross-border commercial disputes. Legal figures said the dispute was likely to rumble on to litigation, such was the lack of clarity provided, as they advanced competing arguments about where responsibility lay under the newly published contract.
Turner said he believed it required AstraZeneca to do only as much as it reasonably could to fulfil the EU’s initial order of 300m doses with stock produced within the EU, which he said must reasonably be interpreted as not including the UK. “It seems to me that, so far as the initial 300m doses are concerned, AstraZeneca has a pretty good ground for arguing that it is not required to divert vaccine manufactured in the UK. “And that’s the conclusion really … Essentially, clause 5.1 says quite clearly AstraZeneca will be using its best reasonable efforts to manufacture the initial doses within the EU.” However, Richard Parkinson – a commercial contracts partner at JMW solicitors – said he interpreted the contract as requiring the firm to supply the 300m doses from manufacturing plants including those in the UK. “If it has produced those doses, it would appear that it would have to supply them, as its efforts to date have resulted in the creation of that volume of vaccine. “There doesn’t appear to be anything in the contract stating that the UK’s orders take priority. Therefore, AstraZeneca appears to be in a position whereby it has two customers who each seemingly have a valid claim on the doses that have been manufactured.” Both pointed out that the contract would come under Belgian jurisdiction. While Turner stressed that he is not qualified there, he said his analysis of the document led him to believe that – should he be proven wrong and the EU proven right – AstraZeneca would have no grounds to argue that doses must not be taken from the UK to make up the shortfall. He explained that the contract with the EU sets out that no other deal should take precedence. Parkinson added: “Even if the UK contract does say that it should be given priority, this doesn’t affect the EU’s position – though it may give the UK another ground to bring a claim against AstraZeneca.” Speaking yesterday, David Greene – the president of the Law Society and a senior partner at Edwin Coe, where he litigates contracts – predicted the row was likely to be settled by arbitration to avoid a court battle, should it be determined that AstraZeneca has to make good with the EU right away."
2021-01-30T05:57:01Z,business,Business,GameStop shares surge again as Robinhood restores trading,"Shares in companies including videogame retailer GameStop soared again on Friday, as an army of small investors taking aim at Wall Street regained access to amateur share trading platform Robinhood. The app, weaponised by activist small investors to trap hedge funds in a “short squeeze” that has cost them $20bn on paper by some estimates, had suspended buying of stocks such as GameStop, cinema chain AMC and BlackBerry on Thursday. But it secured a $1bn (£730m) cash injection from its backers on Thursday evening, which the company said it required to allow its users to resume their buying spree, which began on the WallStreetBets forum of chat forum Reddit. The decision to permit what Robinhood said would be “limited buys” resulted in GameStop’s shares climbing more than 67.6% on Friday, taking its notional value to more than $22bn, nearly 80 times what it was worth this time last year. The company’s shares had whipsawed a day earlier, finishing the day 44% lower after Robinhood barred users from buying more stock, threatening the Reddit rebellion.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission also jumped into the battle between small investors and Wall Street hedge funds on Friday, warning both brokerages and small traders that it was closely monitoring potential wrongdoing. “The commission is working closely with our regulatory partners … to ensure that regulated entities uphold their obligations to protect investors and to identify and pursue potential wrongdoing,” the SEC said. In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority issued a warning to British amateur traders thinking of jumping into the fray. The FCA advised them to use “extreme caution” and warning they could lose money quickly and irretrievably. While Robinhood is not available in the UK after cancelling a launch last year, platforms such as Trading212 offer a similar service.
Robinhood allowed buying to resume after tapping investors to draw down at least several hundred million dollars via a credit facility from banks led by JP Morgan and including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Barclays. A spokesperson for Robinhood early on Friday described the $1bn (£730m) injection as a “strong sign of confidence” that will help it “further serve our customers”. In a blog post late on Friday night in the US, Robinhood said the amount it had to deposit with the clearing house was so large that it had to limit buying in certain securities. “With individual volatile securities accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars in deposit requirements… we had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile securities to ensure we could comfortably meet our requirements,” it said. Robinhood also contacted existing investors, which include hedge funds Sequoia Capital and Ribbit Capital, about emergency funding, according to the New York Times. The move to stop trades had outraged users of the platform, which says its mission is to “democratise finance for all”, and prompted questions from US politicians. Vlad Tenev, Robinhood’s co-founder, took to Twitter to quash theories that the temporary ban was about protecting hedge funds, some of which pay the company for the right to execute its users trades, known as “market-making”. “This decision was not made on the direction of any marketmaker we route to or other market participants,” Tenev said. “We plan to allow limited buys of these securities. We’ll continue to monitor the situation and make adjustments as needed. We cannot control, however, the lightning fast spread of information and misinformation that takes place on social media.” Robinhood’s explanation for why it needed to suspend trading is complex, making it harder for the company to rebuff allegations of Wall Street cronyism levelled at it by its users, celebrities and even politicians as disparate as Republican Ted Cruz and Democrat Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez. By Friday morning, according to analyst S3 Partners, GameStop’s Wall Street short sellers had lost more than $19.75bn so far this year
Many of the Robinhood traders haven’t been buying shares in the traditional sense but using options, essentially borrowing from the company to fund their trades. Like any broker of financial instruments, Robinhood processes those trades via “clearing houses”, which want to know the broker can make good on those trades if everything goes wrong and its customers can’t fund their own positions. The sheer volume of trading in firms such as GameStop – and the wild movement of their shares on the markets – meant Robinhood was in danger of having too little money on hand to do that. That, says Robinhood, is why it had to suspend trading on Thursday. Raising $1bn from investors has put the company in a position that satisfies clearing houses that it has enough money, allowing trading to resume."
2021-01-29T17:48:55Z,business,Business,Dr Martens will make stock market debut at value of £3.7bn,"Dr Martens will make its stock market debut at 370p a share, giving it a valuation of £3.7bn at the top end of its range after keen investor demand for the famous boot brand meant the offer was eight times oversubscribed. As part of the flotation, the company’s private equity owner, Permira, and other existing shareholders have sold 350m shares at 370p each that will result in them splitting a £1.29bn windfall. The stake of the Griggs family, who sold to Permira for £300m in 2013 but retained a near 10% shareholding, is worth £129m of the windfall. Permira owns about 75% of Dr Martens, making its share about £970m.
The company had priced its initial public offering at between 330p and 370p, and it has hit the top end of the range. As a result of the demand, the principal shareholders have chosen to sell an additional 52.5m shares by exercising an over-allotment option, which will take the overall windfall up to £1.5bn. This will bring the total number of shares in public hands to 403m, accounting for 40.3% of Dr Martens’ total issued share capital. Shares were up 22% at 450p in conditional trading on Friday, among investors who were allocated shares in the IPO, but full market trading begins on 3 February. About 22 senior staff have become paper multimillionaires overnight, receiving share awards worth more than £350m in the flotation. They include the chief executive, Kenny Wilson, who joined the company in 2018 and is in line for a stake worth more than £60m. He previously worked for Cath Kidston, which collapsed last year. Dr Martens’ chairman, Paul Mason, who was once the chief executive of Asda, will also receive a multimillion-pound windfall. A group of former Dr Martens staff will receive shares worth at least £150m between them, while about 2,200 more junior employees are expected to receive cash bonuses. “We have been delighted by the strong levels of interest, engagement and support from such a high-quality selection of institutional investors,” Wilson said. “The successful transformation of Dr Martens is a great story, and what is even more exciting is the huge potential ahead. We are proud to take our place as a London-listed company, both delivering as a successful plc and, more importantly, continuing to grow our brand around the world.” Under Permira’s ownership Dr Martens has significantly increased its global presence, opening new stores and expanding its e-commerce offering, and sales of its distinctive chunky boots have risen sharply in recent years. The first pair of UK-made Dr Martens boots were produced in 1960. Sales of the classic 1460 and other styles have risen more than fourfold in the past seven years, from £160m in 2013 to £672m in the year to March 2020.
Dr Martens, which sells 11m pairs of shoes and boots a year across more than 60 countries, has managed to weather the Covid pandemic well, despite lockdowns that forced its 130 high street stores to shut. Sales rose 18% to £318m in the six months to September and profits grew by a third to £86.3m. The majority of sales come from its wholesale business, which sells to retailers. The footwear brand began as a collaboration between a small shoe factory in Northamptonshire and two doctors in Munich, one of whom, Dr Klaus Märtens, had developed an air-cushioned chunky sole in 1947 after a foot operation following a skiing accident. The shoe-making Griggs family acquired the licence and designed the 1460 in April 1960 (hence the name). The boots grew in popularity after being adopted by skinheads in the 1960s, and later became fashion staples among punks and goths. More recently, chunky boots have become mainstream fashion, with the model turned actor Agyness Deyn and the singer Rihanna among the wearers. Dr Martens came close to bankruptcy in 2003, when it cut jobs in the UK and moved manufacturing to China."
2021-01-29T17:46:42Z,business,Business,Cornwall gears up to cash in as Covid rules threaten foreign trips,"Holiday accommodation owners in Cornwall are being deluged with enquiries from Britons planning a domestic summer holiday, after the government’s new Covid travel restrictions dampened hopes of overseas trips this year. “This week in particular it has really picked up,” said Malcolm Bell, chief executive of official tourist body Visit Cornwall. “Where there is a lot of interest is in hotels with facilities, spas and swimming pools, and motorhomers who thought: ‘I won’t be doing four weeks in France this year.’ Some of our most expensive hotels which normally get two or three night stays are up to four and five night stays. People are choosing it as a more significant holiday,” said Bell. In addition to the G7 summit, being hosted at Carbis Bay in June, the health secretary, Matt Hancock announced in January that he had booked a trip to Cornwall, while warning that foreign holidays may not be possible in 2021 and people should plan for a “great British summer”. Government restrictions on foreign travel, including the introduction of hotel quarantine for British citizens arriving from countries deemed high-risk, has directly influenced consumers’ internet searches, according to analysts at investment firm Jefferies.
They found that Google searches for “Cornwall holiday” increased during the traditionally important January booking window, while those for package holiday operators – including Tui, Jet2 and On the Beach – declined. “We expect government policy volatility to continue into the summer, from both the UK and destination markets,” said the Jefferies analysts in a research note, although they added that there would be pent-up demand for foreign holidays in the future, once restrictions lift and more people are vaccinated. Heidi Clemo, who along with her husband runs the Little Winnick caravan and camping park at Pentewan in southern Cornwall, said she anticipating another busy tourist season, once they are allowed to welcome visitors back to England’s southernmost county. Under current Covid restrictions, domestic holidays are also banned. “We have seen a massive surge in bookings, but we have also seen a change to the type of bookings,” Clemo said. “In January we’d normally be getting tentative spring booking for short breaks, whereas right now we are getting long 10-, 14-, 21-night bookings”. The touring park was fully booked for the whole of last summer, albeit at a reduced capacity, once the business was allowed to reopen. Cornwall proved a popular destination last summer as visitors enjoyed its beaches and rugged coastline, as well as its attractions, seafood restaurants and country pubs. Clemo and other Cornish business owners are expecting a repeat performance this year, which would supply an injection of cash they sorely need. The Cornish tourism industry lost out on £1bn last year as a result of coronavirus closures and reduced capacity, according to Visit Cornwall, totalling about £200m in lost profit."
2021-01-29T17:41:33Z,business,Business,Chinese carbuyers help Jaguar Land Rover outpace UK lockdowns,"Jaguar Land Rover staged a recovery in the final three months of 2020, as the growth of car sales in China made up for the UK’s continued lockdowns and its setting aside of £35m to pay fines for missing carbon dioxide emissions targets. The carmaker made pre-tax profits of £439m in the last quarter of the year, £121m higher than in 2019, JLR said on Friday. Revenues recovered to £6bn, £1.6bn more than the July-to-September period, although still lower than at the same point the year before. JLR lost its status as the largest carmaker in the UK during 2020 as production fell by a third, allowing it to be narrowly overtaken by Nissan, the Japanese carmaker. The production fall was a testament to the difficulties faced by carmakers in Britain and beyond, as the coronavirus pandemic forced JLR and its rivals to shut factories for months, and hit sales. JLR lagged behind rivals in restarting production. However, the carmaker, which is owned by India’s Tata Motors, said sales in China, which has reduced Covid-19 cases, were a fifth higher in the three months to December than both the previous quarter and the same period the year before. JLR sold 128,000 cars during the quarter, down by 9% year-on-year amid continued restrictions in key markets such as the UK, helped by the rollout of the revamped Land Rover Defender. The carmaker sold 16,300 of the new off-roaders, whose launch was delayed by the pandemic.
JLR’s improved profitability partly reflected £400m in cost savings during the quarter, part of a revamp started by its previous chief executive Ralf Speth. The former Renault boss Thierry Bolloré, who took over at JLR in July, is working on his own long-term strategy for the company as it moves towards pure battery electric cars. The fine for missing EU emissions targets highlighted the challenge JLR faces, as its big, heavy petrol and diesel cars generally emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide. JLR has started to aggressively promote plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) that combine internal combustion engines with battery power that can lower emissions if charged correctly. Matthias Schmidt, an independent automotive analyst, said PHEV sales, which are attractive to company car drivers, would be likely to protect it from large fines during 2021. Bolloré said he was “encouraged by the improved financial performance in this first full quarter as CEO”, but predicted continued turbulence for carmakers. “Looking ahead, these challenges continue, including the Covid pandemic and its impact on the global economy, the UK’s new trading relationship with the EU and the significant technological changes taking place in the automotive industry,” he said."
2021-01-29T17:27:28Z,business,Business,Vaporiser maker to be first medical cannabis firm listed in London,"An Israeli-founded firm that makes vaporisers is on course to become the first medical cannabis company to float on the London Stock Exchange next month, after regulators gave the green light. Kanabo set a date of 16 February for its stock market debut and is setting its sights on the UK after securing £6m from investors, valuing the company at £23.2m. The firm, which issued its float prospectus to potential investors on Friday, expects to be the first to offer UK investors shares in a company that makes money directly from medical cannabis. It comes after the Financial Conduct Authority said last year that UK-based medical cannabis firms could list in London. Although Kanabo is originally an Israeli firm, it was bought by the UK-based cash shell company Spinnaker in 2019. Kanabo makes a medical-grade vaporiser that uses cartridges of liquid derived from cannabis flowers. “It’s something my grandma can use,” said the chief executive, Avihu Tamir, who got into the industry after becoming one of the early recipients of medical cannabis in Israel. “I found myself sitting in a clinic with a nurse teaching me how to roll a cannabis cigarette,” he said. Tamir said Kanabo’s vaporiser is an upgrade for patients and doctors because it delivers a precise 1mg dose with every inhalation, and will appeal to users who typically prefer an act similar to smoking rather than ingesting pills. He added that the company would target the UK market in the belief that patients’ past difficulty in accessing cannabis, despite legalisation, is dissipating. One of the problems has been that companies required a prescription before they could import and many GPs were not keen to prescribe. But Tamir said new specialist clinics were easing the bottleneck. “The distributors that have the clinics know how to collect together a sufficient amount of prescription for three or six months ahead, so they can import in bulk and dispense from there,” he said. While medical cannabis companies can list in the UK, those that sell recreational weed remain barred, even if they operate in countries where it is legal."
2021-01-29T16:48:03Z,business,Business,City trader jailed for Libor rigging freed after five years,"Tom Hayes, the City trader jailed for manipulating Libor interest rates, has been released from prison after serving what he called a “traumatic” five and a half years in custody. The former star UBS and Citigroup trader was the first person to be convicted by a jury of rigging the financial industry benchmark and was released after serving half of his 11-year sentence. During his trial Hayes was described as the ringleader in a vast conspiracy to fix the Libor rate – used to price trillions of pounds worth of financial products – between 2006 and 2010. A gifted mathematician who was diagnosed with mild Asperger’s syndrome shortly before his trial, Hayes was charged by both UK and US prosecutors. He earned millions of pounds for his work as a trader, but claimed during his trial that he was taking part in an “industry-wide” practice. He was convicted of eight counts of conspiracy to defraud. “Today I begin the process of rebuilding my life and my shattered relationship with my son, Joshua,” Hayes told reporters. He was met by his wife and child following his release from HMP Ford, an open prison in Arundel on England’s south coast. “After a traumatic five and a half years in custody and two and a half years of bail, my eight-year ordeal in the UK is almost over,” he said, adding: “I’m going to enjoy my first doner kebab in a long time.” Since his conviction in August 2015 Hayes has maintained his innocence, and has accused the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), of making him a scapegoat. He continues to try to clear his name and have his conviction overturned through an appeal to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates suspected miscarriages of justice.
Hayes’ lawyer, Karen Todner – who led Gary McKinnon’s case against extradition to the US on charges of computer hacking – said Hayes had been made a “scapegoat with a disability” for more senior executives. She also called on the CCRC to respond more quickly to applications. His previous attempts to have his conviction overturned failed, although his sentence was reduced from an initial 14 years to 11. Other traders were convicted of Libor manipulation after Hayes, including a group of four Barclays traders. Following a string of scandals and fines totalling billions for banks that manipulated the rate, the FCA decided in 2017 to phase out Libor, and the index will stop being used this year."
2021-01-29T16:28:32Z,business,Business,WallStreetBets' founder on GameStop: 'I didn't think it would go this far',"Jaime Rogozinski always knew WallStreetBets, the Reddit forum he founded, was part of something big â€“ but even he wasnâ€™t prepared for quite how big.
This week WallStreetBets was at the center of a full-scale war between Wall Street and an army of small investors over GameStop, an ailing video games chainstore, that has shaken financial markets, angered billionaire bankers and made unlikely allies of political enemies. â€œIâ€™m amazed how far itâ€™s gone,â€� Rogozinski told the Guardian from his home in Mexico City. Conceived around the time that social media was propelling democratic movements worldwide, WallStreetBets has played an important, if now contentious, part in lowering barriers of entry to financial information. The frenzy has also taken on political overtones, as if the elective struggle of 2020 had simply transferred to competing ideologies about the distribution of wealth. To some, the activity signals the barbarians have reached the gates to the high citadels of finance; to others, it is a liberation from the control of entrenched masters in a corrupted system. â€œI predicted it would go in this direction but I didnâ€™t think it would go this far. I donâ€™t think anyone thought this was possible. To an extent, coronavirus has helped fuel the velocity and direction of the changes taking place,â€� he says. Rogozinski, 39, is still trying to get to grips with the role his 2012 creation, now with more than 3.5 million subscribers, is playing in shaking up financial markets. In part he sees it as payback for the way financiers have behaved. â€œWall Street has always been getting away from its original intent, which was to provide capital to society. Little by little it has turned into a casino, a place for speculative games,â€� he says.
That casino mentality was on full display this week when GameStop â€“ a 37-year-old struggling retailer â€“ became the worldâ€™s hottest investment. Small investors bonded together on the Reddit forum, spurred on by members with names such as Roaring Kitty, to take on some of Wall Streetâ€™s biggest investors who they believed had made a bad bet on the company collapsing. The professional investors had â€œshortedâ€� GameStop â€“ a bet its price will collapse â€“ along with other companies that have since soared including the cinema chain AMC and BlackBerry. Incredibly, the WallStreetBets crowd won the round, forcing some out of the trade and causing consternation and fears of an electronic financial insurgency on Wall Street. As of early on Friday, GameStop short sellers had lost $19.75bn so far this year, according to analyst S3 Partners. On Thursday, popular trading conduits â€“ Robinhood and Ameritrade â€“ clamped down on retail investorsâ€™ bets on several highly popular but volatile stocks, locking traders out of the market and drawing sharp criticism from some users and politicians from the conservative Texas senator Ted Cruz and the self-described democratic socialist congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, longtime sparring partners.
Rogozinski canâ€™t say if the brokers were correct to step in to limit trading, only that given the scale of the disruption, authorities could be expected, rightly or wrongly, to find some channel to curb the activity. â€œWhether or not some of this trading is legal or not, what weâ€™re seeing is not normal, so some outside pressure is being put on brokers to do this to their customers because it doesnâ€™t make business sense.â€� Rogozinski started WallStreetBets as an antidote to staid advice on trading forums and insider-focused commentary on financial news cable stations like CNBC. What individual investors needed, he figured, was something irreverent, homegrown and inclusive. WallStreetBets was given the tagline: â€œLike 4Chan found a Bloomberg Terminal.â€� At the time, Rogozinski was single and working as an information technology consultant at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington DC, a job he has since traded for family life in Mexico and a job in financial tech. â€œI started WallStreetBets when I had time and money I could afford to lose. Now Iâ€™m a family man and my appetite for risk has diminished. Iâ€™ve moved past that stage.â€� Rogozinski hasnâ€™t been associated with the chat platform since April, and has deleted a subforum on Discord he felt had become infiltrated with extremist views and offensive comments that had little to do with finance. The backlash to the Discord deletion was swift and it may speak to the nature of the moment that Rogozinski, who had published a book, WallStreetBets: How Boomers Made the Worldâ€™s Biggest Casino for Millennials, was expelled by other moderators, which at one time included the disgraced pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli, before he was convicted of securities fraud. Some have seen WallStreetBets as the offspring of the 2010 Occupy Wall Street protests â€“ a popular uprising against the excesses of capitalism and the bailout of banks after the last financial crisis. Now armed with effective tools to register their unhappiness with the system, the peasants have revolted. Itâ€™s a conjunction, he says, that doesnâ€™t necessary fit. â€œI can see parallels, and appreciate the narrative of a feelgood story, but weâ€™re not in the same moment. In 2010, the grievances being aired were different. Iâ€™m confident to say that the people doing this didnâ€™t start with an agenda. This most likely happened because people were trying to make money and happened to organize around this type of trade. â€œThe sheer entertainment value of WallStreetsBets begs for there to be a nemesis and for someone to be on the other side of the trade. A year ago they were short-sellers. It just so happens short-sellers are now on the target side. Theyâ€™re nimble and when the time comes theyâ€™ll switch it up.â€� Not withstanding the overarching purpose of making money, Rogozinski says it is correct to interpret the forum as part of an effort to democratize Wall Street, just as other forms of social media have played a part in democratizing politics. They, too, have come with unpredictable results. â€œThese are natural forces that come as a consequence of lowering the barriers to entry. I canâ€™t take credit for Robinhood, but they fulfilled the ability for anybody to participate in this. Theyâ€™re taking advantage of access.â€� But Rogozinski acknowledges dangers in placing sophisticated options plays in the hands of individual investors that leverage up and take advantage of a flaw in exotic investments â€œso complex that theyâ€™re virtually unexplainable to non-professionalsâ€�. â€œItâ€™s democratic, yes, but to give amateurs access to such sophisticated plays can be incredibly dangerous. Shifts in the composition of the markets, combined with the speed of the shifts, is outlining fragility in the system.â€� Unintended consequences, he says, â€œshould not be ruled outâ€�. Joshua Mitts, an expert on hedge fund activism, short-selling and securities, at Columbia University, believes retail investors have been victims of trading strategies by sophisticated investors. â€œYou can see systematic downward price manipulation that often harms what are often a loyal devoted group of retail investors in a company. Those investors have now decided to take matters into their own hands,â€� he says. Mitts, who was recently cited in a Institutional Investor report, The Dark Money Secretly Bankrolling Activist Short-Sellers, says that from a policy standpoint, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the USâ€™s top financial watchdog, has taken little action to protect individual investors and â€œno regulatory information on rules of the road for social media tradingâ€�. The GameStop drama, he adds, â€œcould be a dangerous consequence of regulatory inactionâ€�. But Mitts questions the narrative of a disparate, populist rebellion. â€œWe donâ€™t know if this is being engineered. Individual investors could be being defrauded on these forums. Itâ€™s an open question. It could very well be that this bubble could have be an engineered misinformation campaign, and the need to know is quite urgent.â€� Rogozinski, too, doesnâ€™t discount the timing of GameStop run-up, effectively pushing politics and the pandemic aside, and arriving so soon after a resolution to the political tumult of 2020. â€œThe timing is interesting, absolutely,â€� Rogozinski says. â€œBut it is natural for an event that gets this much attention to turn political. Itâ€™s got the attention of the White House, big-time senators in Congress, and thereâ€™s no avoiding it. But within the forum itself, politics is almost never discussed.â€� Rogozinski is a clueless as anyone as to how this will play out but he is certain someone will be made a scapegoat. â€œYou know theyâ€™re going through regulatory statutes looking for anything to apply to this â€“ one, to apply pressure to brokers and secondly to get new legislation drafted.â€� Inevitably, he says, regulators will â€œstep in and find at least one person guilty of fleecing someone or breaking a regulatory statuteâ€�."
2021-01-29T15:47:00Z,business,Business,Marston's pub chain receives takeover proposal from US private equity group,"The pub chain Marston’s has received a takeover approach from a US private equity group in a move that could fuel a spate of deals in the embattled hospitality sector. The news of the all-cash offer from Platinum Equity Advisors prompted a 17% spike in Marston’s share price to 87p, giving the pub and brewing group a market value of £553m. “The board of Marston’s confirms that it has today received an unsolicited non-binding proposal from Platinum Equity Advisors regarding a possible cash offer,” the company said in a statement to the stock market. “The board will evaluate the proposal with its advisers and a further announcement will be made in due course.” Under stock market rules, Platinum now has until the end of the day on 26 February to make a formal offer. Marston’s, formerly known as Wolverhampton & Dudley Breweries until a 2007 rebrand, owns about 1,400 pubs, restaurants, cocktail bars and hotels across the UK, including the Pitcher & Piano chain. The pub group owns the freehold in about 90% of its pub properties. Under Ralph Findlay, Marston’s long-serving chief executive, the business has significantly expanded in recent years. Last month, the family-owned Welsh brewer SA Brain & Co handed over the running of its 156 pubs to Marston’s, saving 1,300 jobs, after the coronavirus pandemic threatened closures. Covid restrictions have battered the sector. Marston’s shares were trading at almost 130p in 2019 before the pandemic hit; the slump has now made it a takeover target. Earlier this month, former Greene King chief Rooney Anand raised £200m to invest in pubs with the support of private equity backers.
Despite resilient trading through the summer, Marston’s announced in October that aimed to make 2,150 of its 14,000 employees redundant, as government restrictions to curb the pandemic took a toll. Last May, Carlsberg and Marston’s announced a joint venture called the Carlsberg Marston’s Brewing Company. The Danish brewer took a 60% stake, while Marston’s retained a 40% stake as well as taking a £273m cash payment. In 2019, Greene King was bought by Li Ka-Shing, head of Hong Kong’s richest family, for £2.7bn. Analysts at Jefferies wrote: “We would argue that Greene King was a far higher quality business than Marston’s based on estate scale, geographic coverage (greater exposure to more affluent UK regions) and profit per pub. Private equity buyers may see a consolidation platform play and therefore be prepared to pay an initially higher multiple.”"

2021-01-29T08:48:57Z,business,Business,Brexit: British business leaders warn of 'substantial difficulties' at UK ports,"The leaders of Britain’s five largest business groups have warned the government that firms face “substantial difficulties” at UK ports since Brexit, with the prospect of a “significant loss of business” if the situation is allowed to continue. Following a round table meeting on Thursday evening with Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, a letter was issued by the CBI, the British Chambers of Commerce, the manufacturers’ group Make UK, the Federation of Small Businesses and the Institute of Directors. The letter said the government needed to act quickly to overcome “the sizeable obstacles” faced by exporters. With hold-ups at UK ports worsening and many lorries making return journeys empty following difficulties obtaining customs certificates, the business groups said ministers needed to act quickly. The letter was published after Gove appeared to play down the significance of the difficulties faced by businesses struggling to overcome customs barriers, and what they described as a lack of coherent advice from government departments about new EU trading rules following Brexit. Gove said after the meeting, which the business leaders believed was private, it is understood, that “some businesses are facing challenges with specific aspects of our new trading relationship with the EU”. He added: “I want to let them know that we will pull out all the stops to help them adjust.” The business groups said: “A range of problems were discussed, including the substantial difficulties faced by firms adapting to the new customs processes, sizeable obstacles to moving goods through the Dover-Calais route and the shortage of informed advice from both government and specialist advisers alongside a number of others.” They warned that grace periods agreed with the EU would expire over the next two months at a time when cross-border traffic, which is usually low in January, was due to grow. Unless measures were put in place to smooth customs procedures, the situation would deteriorate, they said. Last week it emerged that many small UK businesses are being told by advisers working for the Department for International Trade (DIT) to register subsidiaries within the EU single market, from where they can distribute their goods far more freely. Officials were found to be advising firms that it was the best way to circumvent border issues and VAT problems that have been building up since 1 January. A separate report has found that the majority of lorries travelling from the UK to the EU via Calais and Dunkirk are empty, suggesting that the situation at the border has worsened since the UK agreed a trade deal with the EU. According to figures obtained by ITV from the Prefecture Hauts-de-France et du Nord for the week ending 24 January, an average of 3,400 lorries a day travelled from the Port of Dover and Eurotunnel to Northern France. Of these, 65% were empty. The data also shows that heavy goods vehicle traffic in both directions across the Channel was down 30% on normal flows. There were also delays for lorry drivers at the French border after it was found that only one in 10 export health certificates – which are required for consignments of food, including for meat and fish – were correctly completed."
2021-01-29T08:11:27Z,business,Business,"Boohoo in talks to buy Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton","The online group Boohoo has entered exclusive talks to buy the final three Arcadia brands, as the breakup of Sir Philip Green’s collapsed fashion empire looks set to end in devastating job losses among its 13,000-strong workforce. Manchester-based Boohoo confirmed it was in talks to buy Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton from Arcadia’s administrators. It was the second deal announcement in a week for the fast-growing company after it snapped up the Debenhams brand on Monday. Rival online group Asos also confirmed this week it was closing in on a deal to buy Arcadia’s biggest brands, including Topshop, which is considered the jewel in the crown. Neither Boohoo nor Asos, which are web-only, are expected to take on any of Arcadia’s 444 outlets that employ the lion’s share of its 13,000 employees. Some head office jobs could be saved if the new owners opt to retain staff employed in key areas such as buying and design. A consortium that included Next, which offered hope that some high street jobs could be saved, pulled out of the auction.
The development comes days after Boohoo agreed to pay £55m for the Debenhams brand in a deal that will mean the chain’s remaining 118 high street stores will close with the expected loss of 12,000 jobs. Arcadia has been the biggest high street casualty of the pandemic, which has triggered huge changes in shopping behaviour. The lockdowns forced high street stores to close for long periods of time, forcing shoppers to turn to the web to satisfy their needs. The resulting job losses, in an industry that is the UK’s biggest private sector employer, have been devastating. According to the Centre for Retail Research, the UK high street shed 177,000 jobs in 2020, and a further 200,000 are expected to be lost this year. The British Retail Consortium says that over the past two years, one in every 50 outlets has permanently closed, and that this number “will only go up”. “Boohoo Group confirms that it is in exclusive discussions with the administrators of Arcadia over the acquisition of the Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton brands,” the company said. “These discussions may or may not result in agreement of a transaction. A further announcement will be made when appropriate.” Boohoo has reportedly offered about £25m for the trio of Arcadia brands. The deal is expected to be similar to the Debenhams one, with all Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton outlets expected to close and few employees set to transfer over. “Boohoo is rifling through the bargain bins once more,” said Susannah Streeter, a senior investment and markets analyst at investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. “Asos had turned its nose up at the trio of brands but Boohoo clearly believes there is still demand to be squeezed out of them. As an online-only fashion giant, Boohoo would only be interested in the brands, so the rescue of the famous names won’t throw a lifeline to the thousands of shopworkers who are very likely to still face redundancy.’’ Boohoo, which owns brands including PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal, has already taken advantage of the declining fortunes of once big high street chains, buying the Oasis, Coast and Karen Millen brands out of administration though not their high street stores.
The Arcadia brands being bought by Boohoo have not attracted as much buyer interest as Topshop but Andrew Wade, an analyst at the stockbroker firm Jefferies, said they were still well-known brands that had sales of £580m in 2018. “These acquisitions would be very much consistent with Boohoo’s successful approach to date, and we would view the brands as a good fit within the group, particularly given the recent Debenhams deal,” he said. At the start of the week it was announced that Asos had entered exclusive talks to buy Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and the fitness brand Hiit. It is thought Topshop, Arcadia’s prime asset, could go for between £250m and £300m. The administrators have been seeking buyers for parts of Arcadia since it collapsed in November. Evans, its plus-size clothing brand, was sold to City Chic Collective, an Australian retailer, for £23m and will become an online-only label."
2021-01-29T06:00:37Z,business,Business,Covid crisis is fuelling food price rises for world's poorest | David Malpass,"Over the last year, Covid-19 has undone the economic, health and food security of millions, pushing as many as 150 million people into extreme poverty. While the health and economic impacts of the pandemic have been devastating, the rise in hunger has been one of its most tangible symptoms. Income losses have translated into less money in people’s pockets to buy food while market and supply disruptions due to movement restrictions have created local shortages and higher prices, especially for perishable food. This reduced access to nutritious food will have negative impacts on the health and cognitive development of Covid-era children for years to come.
Global food prices, as measured by a World Bank food price index, rose 14% last year. Phone surveys conducted periodically by the World Bank in 45 countries show significant percentages of people running out of food or reducing their consumption. With the situation increasingly dire, the international community can take three key actions in 2021 to increase food security and help prevent a larger toll on human capital. The first priority is enabling the free flow of food. To avoid artificial shortages and price spikes, food and other essential goods must flow as freely as possible across borders. Early in the pandemic, when perceived shortages and panic generated threats of export bans, the international community helped keep food trade flows open. Credible and transparent information about the state of global food inventories – which were at comfortable levels pre-Covid – along with unequivocal free-trade statements from the G20, World Trade Organization, and regional cooperation bodies helped reassure traders, and led to helpful policy responses. Special rules for agriculture, food workers and transport corridors restored supply chains that had been briefly disrupted within countries. We need to remain vigilant and avoid backsliding into export restrictions and hardened borders that make food – and other essentials – scarce or more costly. The second priority is bolstering social safety nets. Short-term social safety nets offer a vital cushion for families hit by the health and economic crises. In Ethiopia, for example, households that experienced problems in satisfying their food needs initially increased by 11.7 percentage points during the pandemic, but participants in our long-running Productive Safety Net programme were shielded from most of the negative effects. The world has mounted an unprecedented social protection response to Covid-19. Cash transfers are now reaching 1.1 billion people, and innovative delivery mechanisms are rapidly identifying and reaching new groups, such as informal urban workers. But “large scale” is not synonymous with “adequate”. In a review of Covid-19 social response programmes, cash transfer programmes were found to be: Short-term in their duration – lasting just over three months on average Small in value – an average of $6 (£4.30) per capita in low-income countries Limited in scope – with many in need remaining uncovered The pandemic has reinforced the vital imperative of increasing the world’s investments in social protection systems. Additional measures to expedite cash transfers, particularly via digital means, would also play an important role in reducing malnutrition. The third priority is enhancing prevention and preparedness. The world’s food systems endured numerous shocks in 2020, from economic impacts on producers and consumers to desert locust swarms and erratic weather. All indicators suggest that this may be the new normal. The ecosystems we rely on for water, air and food supply are under threat. Zoonotic diseases are on the rise owing to growing demographic and economic pressures on land, animals and wildlife.
A warming planet is contributing to costlier and more frequent extreme weather events. And as people pack into low-quality housing in urban slums or vulnerable coastal areas, more are living in the path of disease and climate disaster. Development gains can be wiped out in the blink of an eye. Our experience with hurricanes or seismic events shows that it is more effective to invest in prevention, before a catastrophe strikes. That’s why countries need adaptive social protection programmes – programmes that are connected to food security early warning systems and can be scaled up in anticipation of shocks.
The time is long overdue to shift to practices that safeguard and increase food and nutrition security in ways that will endure. The to-do list is long and urgent. We need sustained financing for approaches that prioritise human, animal and planetary health; restore landscapes and diversify crops to improve nutrition; reduce food loss and waste; strengthen agricultural value chains to create jobs and recover lost incomes; and deploy effective climate-smart agriculture techniques on a much greater scale. The World Bank Group and partners are ready to help countries reform their agriculture and food policies and redeploy public finance to foster a green, inclusive, and resilient recovery. Focusing on food security would address a basic injustice: almost one in 10 people live in chronic hunger in an age of food waste and plenty. This focus would also strengthen our collective ability to weather the next storm, flood, drought, or pandemic – with safe and nutritious food for all. • David Malpass is president of the World Bank Group."
2021-01-29T06:00:37Z,business,Business,UK economy suffering most damage since first wave of Covid-19,"Britain’s economy is suffering the most damage since the first wave of Covid-19 as persistently high infection rates and renewed lockdown measures delay the economic recovery from the pandemic, according to a Guardian analysis. Almost a year on since the pandemic spread to Europe, focus is shifting towards how quickly coronavirus vaccines can be deployed, with the UK, for now, among countries leading the pack. Economists said this could increase the likelihood of the British economy outperforming other countries’ later this spring, depending on when lockdown restrictions are lifted. However, pressure is mounting on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to provide further financial support before the 3 March budget as the economic damage intensifies during the prolonged lockdown at the start of 2021. It comes as tensions between countries increase with regards vaccine supplies, with clashes between the UK and the EU over the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab. Concerns about mutations in the virus have also been growing since the emergence of new variants in England, South Africa and Brazil, leading experts to warn that defeating Covid-19 will require global coordination. As few as 25 doses have been administered across low-income countries compared with 39m in wealthier ones, according to the World Health Organization last week. In a new intervention, the president of the World Bank, David Malpass, warned governments across the globe that urgent action was necessary to prevent years of development gains being wiped out in poorer nations. Writing in the Guardian, the head of the Washington-based agency said countries should avoid hardening their borders to allow the continued flow of food and other essentials. “The time is long overdue to shift to practices that safeguard and increase food and nutrition security in ways that will endure. The to-do list is long and urgent,” Malpass said. Since the onset of the pandemic, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the level of the FTSE 100, to track the impact of coronavirus on jobs and growth, and the measures used to contain it. Faced with the deepest global recession since the Great Depression, the Covid crisis watch also monitors how the UK is faring compared with other countries. The International Monetary Fund has estimated the UK economy contracted by 10% in 2020, the biggest fall of any G7 country. This month, the dashboard includes some positive signs after official data showed Britain’s economy shrank by less than expected during the November lockdown, in a sign that businesses have adapted to restrictions. Raising hopes that a double-dip recession can be avoided, gross domestic product fell by 2.6% on the month as hospitality venues operated takeaway services, more shops stayed open than during the first wave, and manufacturing and construction activity continued. City economists had forecast a 5.7% monthly decline. Analysts said the partial reopening of the UK economy in December meant growth would probably be flat in the final quarter of 2020. At the start of 2021, Brexit uncertainty has diminished after the signing of the EU free trade agreement, despite some disruption. The vaccine rollout is also underway, with more than 7m doses administered so far – among the highest vaccination rates in the world. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the economics forecasting group the EY ITEM Club, said: “The prospects for recovery are looking brighter. Once the economy has negotiated what is likely to be a challenging first quarter of this year, it will undoubtedly benefit from the vaccine rollout helping to boost consumer and business confidence.” However, there are warning signs that the tougher lockdown at the start of 2021 is inflicting renewed pain on businesses and workers, delaying the economic recovery and undermining Britain’s growth potential.
Ten months into the crisis, surveys of business activity and indicators of mobility levels suggest the largest contraction in the UK economy since the first wave of the pandemic. While more severe job losses have so far been prevented by the Treasury’s furlough scheme, unemployment has hit the highest level in four years, at 5%, with more than 1.7 million people out of work. Almost a million more are expected to lose their jobs after furlough is wound down at the end of April. Ahead of the 3 March budget, Sunak is facing growing calls from business leaders to extend the wage subsidy scheme, with unions and the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell saying an extension until the end of 2021 is needed to avert lasting damage to jobs and the economy. The chancellor is also under pressure to retain the £20 a week uplift to universal credit to prevent financial hardship for millions. Hannah Essex, a co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said ministers needed to keep the furlough scheme open until at least the end of July. “Only with certainty on the future of government support can businesses communities plan ahead and look to restart, rebuild and renew.”"
2021-01-29T05:20:54Z,business,Business,Confused about GameStop? Five films to watch to help you pretend to understand the stock market,"The GameStop debacle has put the stock market on everyone’s radar this week – even those who rarely pay it any attention. Many are depicting the incident as a David-and-Goliath battle between small investors gathering on Reddit message-boards and Wall Street powerbrokers finding themselves unexpectedly on the back foot at their own game. Billions of dollars are in the balance. Along with such major news events, though, come the instant internet experts. Let’s face it: most of us understand diddly squat about the stock market and rely on Hollywood to inform us about an industry that it portrays as a place in which, to quote from the tyrannical, fictional Gordan Gekko: “lunch is for wimps”.
Want to join the conversation about GameStop? Here are five films and TV shows that might help you muddle your way through. 1. Black Monday
Don Cheadle turning charm and smarm up to 100. Regina Hall in blue eyeshadow and big 80s hair. Tony-award winning Andrew Rannells adding another besuited straight-edger to his acting credits, along with The Book of Mormon’s Elder Price – at least at first. Black Monday, in this series, refers to 19 October 1987, still the single worst day for America’s stock market. Produced by Seth Rogen, this technicolour comedy purports to tell the story of who caused the crash that day and how. It’s a kind of cocaine-fulled narrative rollercoaster in which everyone is double-crossing everyone else and you’re never quite sure which character to root for – until you realise that the answer is none of them. 2. The Wolf of Wall Street In this film, Martin Scorsese – a director celebrated for making great gangster movies – turned his focus to Wall Street, applying the same kind of “rise and fall” narrative structure as his films about the Mafia. The Wolf of Wall Street was inspired by former stockbroker Jordan Belfort (adapted from his memoir of the same name), who reacted to the film by suing the financiers and requesting $300m in compensation.
Scorsese’s film is damning in his portrayal of Wall Street culture as a pit of toxic masculinity and various kinds of “isms” – hedonism, chauvinism, sexism. The film suggests succeeding as a big-name stockbroker involves not only being ruthless and calculating but also putting on a show and appealing to people’s base instincts – like an inspirational speaker or a late night TV evangelist. “There is no nobility in poverty”, Leonardo Di Caprio’s Belfort tells his sales team during a shouty pep-talk. In this portrayal, there was no nobility in wealth either. 3. Trading Places
If you think the stock market is wild, just wait until you learn about commodity futures. All will be explained in this vaguely Dickensian Eddie Murphy Christmas comedy that features the price manipulation of oranges, attempted murder, a sex worker with a heart of gold and a live gorilla. If you haven’t guessed by this summary, the answer to your question is yes, this film was made in the 1980s. Viewers be warned: some of the language, politics and visuals of this film would see it very much cancelled in 2001, let alone 2021. 4. American Psycho
This reviewer was never much of a fan of Mary Harron’s frankly disgusting 2000 adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis’ equally icky novel, about a New York stockbroker (Christian Bale) who commits various hideous crimes that will not be retraced here. For one thing, the ending (spoiler alert!) strongly implies it may have all been a series of hallucinations inside the protagonist’s head, attempting to justify grotesque gratuity by contextualising it as a kind of sick recurring daydream. The prominence of murders and orgies does however carry an unsubtle metaphorical message about capitalism and the way it works. “This confession has meant nothing,” Bale’s character famously says towards the end, his crimes going unpunished. 5. The Big Short
There were people in Wall Street who saw the global financial crisis coming and dove in. Adam McKay’s playful 2015 film follows sharks who got wind of the impending crash and endeavoured to profit from it, including a shoeless heavy metal enthusiast (Christian Bale) and a self-loathing investment maverick (Steve Carell). Aware that his subject matter is potentially dry and confusing, McKay breaks the film up with comedy scenes in which various concepts are explained straightforwardly but in wacky contexts. The director includes, for instance, Margot Robbie in a bubble bath, who, glass of champagne in hand, breaks down the ins and outs of subprime mortgages. It’s a trick designed to make you think, by the end of it, that you’ve actually learned something. Maybe you want some real information? If you want an actual primer on the global economy – how it works, how it fails, and how it can affect so many people’s lives – try John Lanchester’s easily accessible book about the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, Whoops! Why Everyone Owes Everyone and No-One Can Pay. Or you could reach for the NPR podcast Planet Money, which offers fun, digestible explainers on complex financial questions from Modern Monetary Theory to how antitrust laws work. They even have an episode about Trading Places. You can also listen to Full Story’s episode on modern monetary theory here."
2021-01-28T19:38:21Z,business,Business,Seeing the hedge funds being squeezed is fun but it won't last | Nils Pratley,"The squeezing of the hedge funds, or at least a few of them, is splendid entertainment. The pure bizarreness of the rise in GameStop’s share price since the start of this month – a 25-fold rise at the peak – beats anything seen in the dotcom mania at the turn of the century. But the lesson of 20 years ago should be remembered: when it looks easy for anybody to make quick money speculating in stock markets, the party is probably about to end. This Reddit crew prefer a different narrative, naturally. For them, cranking up share prices and trying to create hell for short-selling hedge funds is about beating Wall Street at its own game. And give the traders credit, their loosely coordinated tactics worked like a dream at GameStop. The likes of Melvin Capital, the short-selling hedge fund forced into a bailout, never saw the rebel alliance coming. But let’s not pretend the hedge fund industry is now in tatters or won’t learn from the experience. For starters, a large part of it doesn’t dabble in obscure video gaming retailers. Currencies, government bonds and interest rates are what excites the “macro” crowd. For short-selling hedge funds, the new power of Reddit’s traders (for as long as it lasts) probably won’t be viewed as an existential threat. It’ll be regarded as another factor to incorporate into strategies. Stage one for the hedge funds was about taking bets off the table elsewhere to inspect the new landscape. Stage two may involve reading the Reddit breezes to get a possible edge. Indeed, when the dust settles on the GameStop saga, it would not be a surprise to learn that rival hedge funds joined the squeeze on Melvin and its co-travellers. Hedge funds also like to eat their own. The wider picture is that these unusual stock market events tend not to appear out of nowhere. The oddity this time is that the shares in the spotlight are those of struggling and half-forgotten companies – aside from GameStop, there’s AMC, the US cinema chain, and Nokia and BlackBerry. Back in 1999 and 2000, the speculation centred on new internet companies with little revenue. But the new version still looks like a familiar case of speculative excess that will end badly for many. One common theme is fear of missing out. Redditers who had the nous to get out of GameStop in time will have made life-changing fortunes – they even publish their paper winnings with screenshots. The advertising is powerful but works best for the early-comers. Another ingredient is the notion that stock market risks have reduced. The rip-roaring recovery in share prices after last year’s initial Covid plunge helped on that front. And a critical factor is access to leverage, or magnified bets. In the UK, spread-betting firms are doing great business – IG Group reported a 55% increase in active clients in its last half-year figures. In the US, retail investors are using futures and options, another way to increase the size of a punt.
“One of the surest signs that a bubble is close to bursting is when the retail investor piles in with leverage,” says Albert Edwards, at the investment bank Société Générale. “And if the retail warrior millennial mob are angry now, wait until they lose their shirts in any market collapse.” He blames the US Federal Reserve for creating an environment in which stock market investors believe central bankers, dishing out cheap money, have their back. He’s usually a gloomster but he has a point. GameStop is so much fun it can’t last."
2021-01-28T19:24:13Z,business,Business,'Sending a message': GameStop investors on why they bought shares,"After two weeks in which GameStop became one of the hottest stocks of the year, its share price whipsawed on Thursday when the amateur trading platform Robinhood barred users from investing in a number of stocks including GameStop. As Reddit users urged one another to refrain from selling, three small, amateur investors explained why they had bought shares in the company, and why they aren’t selling despite the risk of losing their money. ‘It was a chance to make money’ A 37-year-old store manager from Pittsburgh, US, first heard about the GameStop shopping frenzy at work. “A few colleagues were hyping it, and some other friends too, all millennials, parents of young kids, online-savvy types. I did some research and immediately knew that I wanted to put my money in, make big gains, and watch the rich cry into their $5,000 suits.” He bought $500 of shares , which have so far netted him gains of 23%. “I thought ‘screw it’ and did it. Then yesterday I bought in with another $500. My parents would freak out if they knew I bought these shares. I’ve heard that people have taken out higher mortgages to go all in with GameStop, but I just used an amount I’m comfortable playing with.” He said buying GameStop shares was not all about making financial gains. “It was a chance to make money, but it’s about so much more than that at this point. My husband and I both earn well, but seven years ago we were priced out of Washington DC and moved to Pittsburgh. We’re renting, we cannot buy a house. I feel like my money, here in my little corner, is making a point.” He added: “I’m not selling. I’m nervous, but I’m holding. I’d rather take a loss than let Wall Street and the Fintech [financial technology] apps win.” ‘I enjoy seeing the average man winning for once’ A 33-year-old solicitor from Greater Manchester said: “I am enjoying seeing the vulture hedge funds that profit from trying to force a company’s price down being on the losing side for once, and the average man winning. “I came across some interesting thoughts on GameStop via the Wallstreetbets thread. The basic thesis was that there are lots of short sellers who owe people GameStop shares, and that they would owe a lot of money and thus be forced to buy back in as their options expire. “I felt the ideas made sense [and] bought 60 shares, partly for a laugh, and sold 15 of them yesterday, for about $300 each. I have 45 shares left, this afternoon they were worth around $380, and if I had sold, I’d have made about $17,000 on an investment of around $2,250.” He said he had bought shares before, but hadn’t gambled like this. “But with GameStop I thought: this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I’m gonna take it.” When his chosen platform halted Gamestop trading, he said: “This would appear to suggest the game is rigged for the benefit of the hedge funds. My 45 shares are currently dropping in value, so we shall see where they end up in a few days. I’m not selling.” ‘It’s not about the money. It’s about sending a message’ A 23-year-old student at London university said he had invested £5,000 in GameStop when the shares were around $60, “but I have friends with far more than that in it. We all joined in, not just because of the money but because we wanted to send a message to Wall Street to tell them it’s not OK for you to make money through the destruction of companies, jobs and the economy.” The student added: “My friends and I have now all covered our initial positions and are riding this until everyone pays. All of our families, friends, rich or poor, have applauded what we are doing. They were scared about the money at first, but they’ve seen the hedge funds cave and now they want to join in to stick it up to Wall Street. “People have not forgiven nor forgotten what happened in 08. It’s not about the money. It’s about sending a message.”"
2021-01-28T17:59:58Z,business,Business,GameStop fun turns serious for Reddit's WallStreetBets,"In normal times, everything on WallStreetBets, the anarchic community of online day traders that has propelled shares of the US video game retailer GameStop up 2,200% this year, is simultaneously a joke and wholly serious. The group, made up of more than 4.5 million members of the social media site Reddit, has been well known in certain corners of the financial community for years thanks to its unique approach to equity markets. A classic WallStreetBets trade tends to include a strong narrative at the root, an almost alarming insight into the deep workings of financial markets as the hook, and then, the essential element, enough self-awareness that the whole thing can be adopted as a sort of quantum joke: it’s either all for a laugh or an entirely reasonable investment proposition, and it is impossible to know which until the dust has settled and the winners and losers have emerged. Take the saga of Hertz. The car rental company filed for bankruptcy protection in May 2020 as a result of the Covid pandemic, and its stock price duly plummeted to record lows. But over the course of June, users on the subreddit began discussing the company. Here, after all, was a household name, trading at just 59 cents a stock. Wasn’t that surprisingly low? Could something not happen to rescue the company, particularly if a million retail investors piled in? And so they did. First came those who were convinced that Hertz had value. Then came those who were convinced that enough other people would be convinced, and then Hertz really would have value. Then came those who just thought it would be fun to join in, and finally those who were attracted by Hertz’s name showing up on the “most traded” list on Robinhood, the free stock trading app that lies at the heart of much of WallStreetBet’s activity. All of that interest was compounded by the hive mind of the community discovering an investing technique labelled “gamma squeeze”. Rather than buying Hertz shares directly, you could buy call options – a deal that lets you buy shares in the future, for a price you pick today. If that future is near, and the price wildly higher than the current price, those options are practically free, because conventional wisdom says they will never pay off. But, redditors realised, the person who sells you those options then needs to go out and buy the stock anyway, just in case the price does go up. That means if enough people buy those options, then the price of the stock will go up, for a fraction of the investment that would be required if they went and bought the shares anyway. The end result? Hertz’s stock price grew tenfold in a matter of weeks, despite the company being bankrupt. When the market inevitably soured – Hertz was ultimately delisted in October – some people had sold out at the top, some had lost cash, but crucially, everyone involved had had fun. The GameStop trade began similarly. Some WallStreetBets users had noticed that the store was trading low, and caught on to the idea that it might have more upside than it was given credit for. They bought in, and joined the chorus arguing that GameStop was worth real money. On top of the “gamma squeeze” that was used with Hertz, another tactic, a “short squeeze”, was spotted – highlighting the fact that a few hedge funds had borrowed and then sold billions of dollars of GameStop stock, which they would have to buy back at inflated prices if the price continued to rise. From there, the same predictable cycle played out: people bought in because they believed in the argument, others joined the rush because they believed there was going to be a rush, and still others joined in just because it was fun. But this time the quantum joke has started to falter. So much money has piled into the company, from such a broad array of investors, that the wry smile is giving way to genuine emotions. One post, with tens of thousands of upvotes, recounts “the enormous repercussions” of the financial crisis, and frames the short squeeze as karmic retribution on Wall Street professionals. “You’re a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage,” the poster writes to Melvin Capital, the most prominent of the GameStop short-selling hedge funds. “I dumped my savings into GME [GameStop’s trading symbol], paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME. This is personal for me, and millions of others. I’m making this as painful as I can for you.” On Thursday, Robinhood and other free trading firms including Trading 212, a British competitor, announced that they would stop trades on GameStop entirely, as well as a range of other WallStreetBets-favoured stocks including the cinema chain AMC and the once-great phone maker Nokia. One hour, and 10,000 comments later, WallStreetBets was on the warpath. “I was done buying. Now I’m gonna switch brokers and buy more. I can’t believe how hard they’re trying to fuck the little guy,” reads the top reply to the top comment. What is not clear is how this might end, other than a lot of people losing a lot of money. But this time, they aren’t going to go down laughing."
2021-01-28T16:34:47Z,business,Business,GameStop shares plunge after ban by Robinhood app,"Small investors mounting an assault on Wall Street speculators suffered a setback on Thursday as trading platforms banned them from buying more shares in GameStop, spawning conspiracy theories, political intervention and at least one lawsuit. Amateur trading app Robinhood stopped users from investing any further in GameStop â€“ a US chain of video games stores â€“ and seven other companies on Thursday, after an extraordinary rise in their value, spurred by users of the chat forum website Reddit, that cost some hedge funds billions of dollars. The move slammed the upward surge in their share prices into reverse and sparked allegations that the hedge funds had wielded influence over Robinhood and other trading platforms to stop the rout. The fallout even caused unlikely accord between opposite extremes of the US political spectrum, with Republican Ted Cruz and Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez both calling for a hearing into the decision to halt the trades.
It follows a meteoric rise in the share price of retailer GameStop and a handful of other stocks including Nokia, cinema chain AMC and BlackBerry, that began on the WallStreetBets page of chat forum Reddit, where users took aim at hedge funds making big bets against the companies. As amateur investors piled into stocks that hedge funds had tipped to struggle or fail, the resulting rise in their share prices saw GameStopâ€™s value hit $30bn (Â£22bn) at one stage - more than 100 times what it was worth in August. This left Wall Street institutions, including hedge fund Melvin Capital, sitting on billions of dollars in losses. But the decision by Robinhood and other trading platforms including Trading 212 â€“ which is popular in the UK â€“ to restrict usersâ€™ activity by allowing them to sell but not buy, removed the major catalyst for the WallStreetBets rebellionâ€™s progress.
GameStop shares were down 44% by the end of the day, while the share prices of seven other companies caught up in the affair, including Nokia, BlackBerry, Trivago and AMC, also suffered big falls as share-buying was effectively halted.
Traders joining in the frenzy have flocked to Robinhood, an app which claims to â€œdemocratiseâ€� finance by letting ordinary people trade shares and more complex financial instruments, such as options. The trades are offered free of commission charges and the app, which was founded only in 2013, now has more than 13m users. But the buying ban on the Reddit traders has sparked a furious backlash. Social media lit up with theories about hedge funds with an interest in the Robinhood company and other trading platforms flexing their muscles to quash the Reddit rebellion. One customer has already filed a class action lawsuit in New York, according to reports in the US. As the backlash built, Robinhood said on Thursday evening that it would allow limited trading on the stocks on Friday. Robinhood has previously faced criticism after a young trader killed himself in the mistaken belief that he had lost $730,000. The company cancelled its UK launch last year. Such is the fresh concern about the potential effect of such platforms on stock markets that the White House and financial regulators have said they are monitoring the situation regarding GameStop and the other stocks in Reddit usersâ€™ sights. A spokesperson for the UKâ€™s Financial Conduct Authority said: â€œThe FCA is aware of the situation and continues to closely monitor trading in UK markets. UK investors should take care when trading shares in highly volatile market conditions that they fully understand the risks they are taking. This applies to UK investors trading both US and UK stocks. â€œFirms and individuals should also ensure they are familiar with, and abiding by, all regulations including the market abuse and short selling regimes in the jurisdiction they are trading in.â€� The phenomenon has been fuelled by small investors not just buying shares but also options, a sort of leveraged financial instrument that forces others to also buy, ratcheting up the power of the transaction.
Pundits have expressed concern that many of the Redditors and small traders who bought stock enthusiastically will lose their money unless they get out quickly. Neil Wilson, chief markets analyst for Markets.com, wrote: â€œIt would appear there is a failure to understand that the only way to realise paper gains after this ramp (pump) is to sell (dump); and in so doing offload your unwanted stock on someone (the greater fool) who thinks it will go even higher.â€� While day-trading investors could lose out, the more immediate result is that hedge funds such as Melvin Capital that bet against GameStop and other companies are caught in a â€œshort squeezeâ€�. The more the shares go up, the bigger the losses they face. They also have to â€œcoverâ€� their position â€“ in effect betting on a continued increase in the share price to offset the losses on their previous bets against it. Melvin Capital said it had closed out its position, crystallising losses, but several other hedge funds are thought to be yet to take the hit. The affair has caused upheaval in the US financial sector, due to the unusual battle between a cohort of many thousands of small-scaled traders and multi-billion dollar investment houses. â€œSometimes the past year has felt as if we were living through a dream or nightmare depending on how you see it,â€� said Saxo Bankâ€™s head of equity strategy Peter Garnry. â€œThe number of things that have turned upside down is breath-taking. The past week has added another dimension to the things that have structurally broken down.â€� He said the wild market movements caused by the Reddit short squeeze on hedge funds could ultimately lead to new financial regulations."
2021-01-28T15:48:46Z,business,Business,"US economy shrank by 3.5% in 2020, the worst year since second world war","The US economy shrank by 3.5% in 2020, the worst year for growth since 1946, as the coronavirus pandemic brought the country to a shuddering halt. In the last three months of the year the economy rose by just 1% compared with the previous quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis – equivalent to an annualized rate of 4%. The latest figures represent a significant slowdown in the economy. In the previous quarter the economy rose by 7.5%, an annualized rate of 33.4%. The reversal comes amid rising rates of Covid 19 infections. More than 429,000 people have now died of Covid 19 in the US and 25.6m cases have been confirmed, according to Johns Hopkins university’s coronavirus tracker. The economic reversal was the first annual contraction for the year since 2009, the depths of the Great Recession, when gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of economic health, shrank by 2.5%. Last year was also the worst year for economic growth since the year after the second world war, when the economy shrank by 11.6%. The US economy has bounced back significantly from the early months of the pandemic. GDP collapsed by an annual rate of 32.9% between April and June. The Biden administration has outlined an ambitious economic recovery program and pledged a significant increase in vaccinations but the coronavirus remains a significant drag on the recovery.
Joe Biden has drawn up a $1.9tn coronavirus and economic stimulus plan that involves immediate pandemic economic relief and longer-term policies aimed at stimulating the economy and tackling the racial and wealth gap inequities that have been exacerbated by the health crisis. But the situation remains dire. Unemployment has dropped sharply from a record high of 14.7% in April to 6.7% in December but the economy still lost 140,000 jobs in the last month of 2020 and the numbers of people filing for weekly unemployment claims remain over four times as high as they were before the pandemic. Another 847,000 people filed for unemployment last week alone. From March 2020 to June 2020, 20.4m jobs were lost from closing and contracting private-sector establishments, an increase of 12.6m jobs from the previous quarter, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Thursday. The Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, warned this week that the US economy was “a long way from a full recovery”, citing the millions of unemployed workers, including the many who have stopped looking for work. Biden faces a tough fight getting his relief package passed. Republicans, who largely ignored Donald Trump’s free-spending ways, have balked at its scale and impact on the national debt. Powell believes now is not the time to worry about the nation’s $27tn federal debt. “I’m much more worried about falling short of a complete recovery and losing people’s careers and lives that they built because they don’t get back to work in time,” Powell said. “I’m more concerned about that and the damage that will do, not just to their lives but to the United States economy.” Oxford Economics described the US economy as “chilled, but not frozen”. GDP remains 2.5% below its pre-Covid level and Oxford Economics does not foresee it reclaiming its end of 2019 level until the second quarter of the year. “Against the risk of excessive winter pessimism, we believe in spring optimism. We foresee record-breaking consumer spending growth in 2021 with households benefiting from a watered-down $1.2tn version of Biden’s American Rescue Plan, vaccine diffusion gradually reaching two-thirds of Americans by July and employment accelerating this spring. After a 3.5% contraction in 2020, we foresee the economy expanding around 5.5% in 2021,” the economists said in a note to investors."

The investors, who use online broker apps such as Robinhood and discuss stocks and tips anonymously on sites such as Reddit, are targeting stocks that have been heavily shorted by hedge funds that stand to lose billions unless their share prices fall dramatically. AMC Entertainment Shares in the world’s largest cinema chain, and owner of Odeon in the UK, surged by 300% on Wednesday, bouncing back to a market value not seen since before the pandemic brought the industry to its knees. The stock fell by 22% in after-hours trading in the evening. American Airlines The company’s share price jumped nearly 10% after it was mentioned on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum. “AAL the next GME?” Asked one Reddit user in an online discussion, referring to GameStop which has risen as much as 1,700% in two weeks. BlackBerry The once must-have phone from the noughties, has seen its share price rise 170% since the start of the year Nokia The Finnish phone company’s shares rose 42% on Thursday, reportedly its biggest one-day percentage gain since it began trading in 1991. Blockbuster The company whose model was all but relegated to history with the rise of streaming services led by Netflix saw gains of much as 700% on Tuesday despite having only one physical video store left. Bed, Bath and Beyond Shares in the US retail chain rose 43% on Wednesday but fell back 12% in after-hours trading. Pearson and Cineworld The UK-based education company and the movie theatre chain, which this week agreed a £200m award to bosses if the share price can bounce back to pre-pandemic levels in three years, both saw rises of about 10% on Wednesday. Both are among the most-shorted of London-listed stocks. Webjet, Tassal Group, Inghams Group and InvoCare Heavily-shorted Australian stocks including these companies all rose on Thursday against an overall fall of Sydney’s benchmark ASX 200 index."
2021-01-28T15:36:43Z,business,Business,Lidl's investment in 51 new UK shops sends it into the red,"Lidl’s British business fell £25m into the red last year despite ringing up strong sales growth after it invested in opening new shops in the UK. The company, which has 800 outlets in England, Scotland and Wales, said the losses followed investment of £654m in 51 new stores, the extension of 13 more sites, and the opening of a new distribution centre in Motherwell, Scotland. The business made a pretax profit of £19m a year before, but that came before a restructuring which combined the group’s store operations and property management into one company. Lidl, which employs nearly 26,000 staff, will invest £1.3bn this year and next with a plan to open about 50 more new stores in 2021 and shift to a new British headquarters in Tolworth, south-west London, and build a new warehouse in Luton. The company also plans to install 300 electric car charging points in its car parks by 2022 and is installing solar panels on new freehold stores. Christian Härtnagel, the chief executive of Lidl GB, said the retailer would not be investing in home delivery despite a surge in demand for online grocery ordering during the pandemic. Online grocery sales have grown to account for nearly 14% in the UK market as a whole, up from just over 7% a year ago, as health concerns have prompted shoppers to order from home. But Härtnagel said he thought families would not continue to buy as much online once fears of the virus had subsided. “Its been an absolutely unprecedented year and nothing about 2020 was normal. A lot of people are talking about a new normal but I fundamentally disagree,” he said. “[Online grocery shopping] may not go back to 7.5% but even if it is going to be 10% it is still absolutely OK for a discount retailer to focus on the 90% of the market that is [in] bricks and mortar [stores]. There is so much more potential in opening stores up and down the country. We are not entertaining any thoughts to go into e-grocery.” He said Lidl was instead investing in keeping prices lower than its competitors, opening stores and its loyalty app, Lidl Plus, which offers perks including discount vouchers if shoppers spend over a certain amount each month. The German discount chain said it booked sales of £6.9bn in the year to 29 February 2020. While it could not provide a comparable figure from the previous year after the company reorganisation, data from the market analyst Kantar indicates that sales rose by more than 9% during the year, making it one of the UK’s fastest-growing grocery chains. Like almost all the grocers, Lidl has seen sales growth rise since then as families have been forced to cook more at home because restaurants, cafes and canteens in many schools and workplaces have been closed during the pandemic.
Sales rose by 18% in the four weeks to 27 December, compared with the same period a year earlier. The increase was larger than those at the UK’s four biggest supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – and Aldi. Härtnagel said: “Our driving focus remains on offering customers the best quality products at the lowest prices in the market. “We are confident in our strategy and see huge potential in the market long-term and will continue to hire more colleagues, invest in British suppliers, open more stores and become an integral part of more communities.”"
2021-01-28T15:24:49Z,business,Business,GameStop: how Reddit amateurs took aim at Wall Street’s short-sellers,"The co-ordinated effort by users of the online forum Reddit to drive up the share price of GameStop and other companies is designed to turn the screw on short-sellers. To the layman, the dynamics at play here can seem dizzyingly labyrinthine. But a good place to start is by understanding what short-selling is – and how the Wall Street wizards who do it could end up being wrong-footed by a group of amateur traders. What is short-selling? It’s a way of making money by betting that a company’s share price will fall. Let’s say StuffCo (a made-up company) has a share price of £10. If I believe the share price is going to rise, I’ll simply buy shares at £10. If the price rises to £15, I can then sell my stock for a profit of £5 per share. Shorting is a little more complicated. If I expect the share price to fall (because I think it is a rubbish business: badly run, for instance, or selling outdated products), I can borrow a share in StuffCo from someone who has it, in return for a small fee. If I sell it straight away, that puts £10 in my pocket. I no longer have the share I borrowed but I will have to give it back at an agreed time. So I wait for the StuffCo share price to fall to £5, then buy it and return one share to the person I borrowed from in the first place. They get their share back and I’ve still got the £10 I sold it for, minus the £5 I had to pay to replace it. I have pocketed £5 by correctly anticipating the fall in the share price. What can go wrong? If my prediction is incorrect and StuffCo’s shares go through the roof, I’m in big trouble. I’ve sold the share I borrowed at £10 but if the value increases to £100, I’ll have to spend £100 in order to give a share back to the person I borrowed from. I’d lose £90. Theoretically my losses are unlimited – because there is no defined ceiling on how far a share can rise. What has happened with GameStop? In this case, Reddit users in a group called WallStreetBets noticed that hedge funds, including one called Melvin Capital, had taken a large short position in GameStop. They decided to punish the Wall Street big boys and launched a co-ordinated buying spree. That began forcing the price up – it is now up more than 1800% – increasing the losses for the short-sellers who had bet against it. They had suffered losses of $1bn already, according to reports on Thursday. The hedge funds found themselves trapped in what is called a “short squeeze”, a kind of feedback loop that drives the price ever upwards. The hedge funds have to start buying the shares, in order to “cover” their position and limit their potential losses. But that buying forces the share price up even more – making their position even worse. Effectively they have been forced to bet on shares rising in order to offset their previous bet on them falling.
How can Reddit users afford the buying spree? They aren’t only buying shares, they’re also using call options. These are the right to buy shares at a certain price and they effectively function as a leveraged bet, a purchase that only requires you to pay a fraction of the share price. This is the fuel that stokes the short-squeeze fire. Do short-sellers deserve it? Hedge funds aren’t exactly the world’s favourite people, given that they make vast quantities of money, often with ruthless disregard for the businesses that become little more than chips in a financial casino game. During the financial crisis, shorting became a byword for vulture capitalism. Hedge funds were accused of deliberately driving companies into the ground by taking out billion-dollar short positions, artificially pushing down share prices to the point that they collapsed, when they might otherwise have survived. Several national financial regulators across the world imposed temporary bans on short-selling certain vulnerable stocks – such as banks or insurers during the post-2008 financial crisis – or even blanket bans on the practice. Is the criticism fair? There is evidence that shorting can accelerate the downward movement of share prices, as big bets on corporate failure become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The counter-argument is that you cannot successfully short a healthy company, as your bet will simply turn out to be wrong. Furthermore, short-sellers can act as an early warning system highlighting bad businesses. They have often proved to be the first people to notice that a company is in trouble, sometimes even before the company’s directors do. Investors took out large short positions in the government outsourcer Carillion before its high-profile collapse. In the recent Wirecard scandal, short-sellers realised the German company was built on sand, even while Germany’s financial regulator continued to bury its head in the sand."

2021-01-28T15:18:19Z,business,Business,UK supermarkets to tell delivery drivers not to hand alcohol to drunk people,"Supermarket delivery drivers are to be told not to hand over alcohol to drunk people or children, as drinks companies seek to show they are acting responsibly amid a surge in online drinks orders. Twelve of the world’s largest drinks brands will unveil the plans on Thursday, drawn up in partnership with UK retailers such as Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda, as well as the delivery specialist Uber Eats.
Under the agreement, staff who deliver food and drinks to the door will be trained in how to spot signs of intoxication and check ID if they suspect someone is underage. They will be asked to refuse to deliver alcohol if need be, just as pub landlords are supposed to do if customers have had too much. Guidance issued to drivers by Uber Eats says: “If you suspect intoxication, please select ‘intoxicated’ in your driver app and politely let the customer know that you cannot complete the delivery.” The companies will train staff on how to prevent trouble and de-escalate conflict when customers take exception to being denied service. Employers will also look at ways to ensure delivery drivers are not discouraged from following the instructions via disincentives such as non-payment for deliveries they refuse to make. Online retailers and delivery services in other countries will also take part, including HipBar in India, Jumia in Africa and JD.com in China. There has been a steep rise in global online alcohol orders, which increased 40% to $17bn in 2020 and are projected to reach $40bn by 2024, according to the alcohol market research firm IWSR. Diageo, whose brands including Guinness and Smirnoff vodka, reported a surge in online alcohol ordering when it released financial results on Thursday. Orders doubled in the UK and trebled in the US. The results reflect a broader trend in the UK during the coronavirus pandemic. Overall alcohol sales have fallen due to the enforced closure of pubs, bars and restaurants, but sales at supermarkets and online have soared.
The tougher controls on online drinks ordering are being coordinated by the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking (IARD), which represents brands including Heineken, the Budweister owner AB InBev, and Diageo. “We feel that it is vital that delivery agents feel supported and empowered to refuse delivery to anyone who is intoxicated or underage,” said Albert Baladi, the IARD chair and chief executive of the US-based spirits maker Beam Suntory. “This partnership enables us to share these tools, where relevant, to support delivery agents in refusing delivery to intoxicated individuals.”"
2021-01-28T14:42:25Z,business,Business,EasyJet revenues down almost 90% in last three months of 2020,"EasyJet suffered another grim quarter at the end of 2020 with revenue down by almost 90% but the budget airline said it was holding on for a surge in traveller numbers later this year if restrictions ease. The airline’s revenues for the last three months of 2020 fell by 88% year-on-year to £165m, it revealed on Thursday. That matched an 87% decline in passenger numbers to just 2.9 million. Global air travel has been decimated in the past year by both pandemic restrictions and a lack of customer demand, but the rapid creation and approval of vaccines has given airline executives reason to hope that 2021 could be the year when sales rebound. Johan Lundgren, easyJet’s chief executive, said the airline planned to fly only 10% of the flights it ran in 2019 between January and March 2020, down from 18% in the last three months of 2020 – almost all of which was domestic travel. However, he said there was a “reasonable chance there will be a good summer”. EasyJet said that holidays bookings for summer 2021 were “currently significantly ahead of last year”. “When restrictions are removed or eased sales go really through the roof on that, so the key now is to make sure the government do have a plan on how to unwind these restrictions as we’re coming into the summer,” he said. The return of international travel is likely to be closely linked to the rollout of vaccines but it remains unclear how long it will be until restrictions on movement are lifted. In the UK 7.1 million people had received the first dose of a vaccine by 26 January, and the government aims to have every adult vaccinated by September. The rollout in the EU has been significantly slower. However, the UK government on Wednesday said travellers would be questioned at airports on their reasons for leaving home, tightening restrictions. Lundgren welcomed the “targeted approach” on enforcing quarantine in hotels only for travellers from high-risk regions. He did not back so-called vaccine passports, saying they were unnecessary when people were flying from areas with similar levels of infections. The uncertainty on the timing of any recovery has heightened scrutiny on airlines’ ability to weather further months without the bulk of their revenues. EasyJet said it had halved its costs in the final quarter of 2020 compared with 2019, reflecting deep cuts, less secure seasonal contracts for pilots and furloughed workers across Europe.
Lundgren said the company’s brand, large network of routes, and cheap prices would help it survive. He also said the company was in a stronger financial position than rivals, and still had multiple options to raise more money if needed, including the sale and leaseback of more planes. “If restrictions were to be continued to the extent we’ve seen across summer, I do think that the government would need to put in place 100% furlough for the whole of the sector,” he said. Shares fell 3% in early trading, but rebounded to gain more than 6.5% by the afternoon."
2021-01-28T14:04:37Z,business,Business,Jump in online and shop sales helps Diageo offset Covid impact,"Drinkers opening expensive bottles of spirits at home helped the Guinness and Smirnoff maker Diageo to weather the coronavirus pandemic, offsetting the closure of pubs, bars and restaurants. Global pre-tax profits were down by 10% but still came in at £2.2bn, on sales that fell only 5% to £6.9bn. Despite the decline in sales and profits, a relatively resilient performance in the face of Covid-19 meant Diageo still felt able to continue its policy of annual increases in its dividend, which rose 2% to 27.96p a share for the half-year payout. In the UK, Diageo managed a 2% sales increase, despite venues where its drinks are sold being closed for large parts of the year due to coronavirus restrictions. Diageo said “off-trade” drinking, from shops and online, was up by more than 30% in the UK, more than offsetting the impact of hospitality closures, with spirits proving particularly resilient, up 15%. While purchases via supermarkets and web-based retailers such as Amazon remain a small part of Diageo’s overall income, they doubled over the period. Diageo’s CEO, Ivan Menezes, pointed to changing consumer habits that could have lasting effects. “There are new habits developing, including making cocktails at home. Some of that will stick,” he said. “But the consumer orientation to return to socialising outside the home is very high so as conditions get back to normal we expect consumers returning to pubs, bars, restaurants and sporting events, so our business will rebalance.” Diageo’s experience mirrors the trend in the UK market, where official figures released towards the end of 2020 showed an overall decline in alcohol sales but significant increases at supermarkets and online, as locked-down consumers bought alcohol to drink at home.
Russ Mould, the investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “Under the circumstances, Diageo’s results could have been a lot worse given the ongoing disruption to the hospitality and travel sectors as fewer people have been able to go to bars, hotels, pubs and restaurants, as well as shop for spirits at airports. “Working in its favour is a rise in alcohol sales during lockdown as people are forced to entertain themselves at home. Notably, spirit sales have held up well and pre-mixed drinks have been very popular. But longer-term Diageo really needs all the leisure establishments to reopen as they are also key drivers of premium spirit product sales.” Julie Palmer, of the corporate restructuring firm Begbies Traynor, pointed to the company’s global reach, which helps it to offset difficulties in one region with recovery in others. “Diageo has benefited from sales in the US where restrictions have not been as strict as Europe, while China’s successful recovery from the pandemic will give the group a major boost as the country returns to some normality,” she said."
2021-01-28T12:38:09Z,business,Business,Norway's sovereign wealth fund gains more than £90bn during 2020,"Norway’s sovereign wealth fund earned more than £90bn during 2020 as the wave of central bank stimulus provided to counter the effects of the coronavirus pandemic pushed up the value of shares and other assets. The fund, built with the revenues from its oilfields, gained 10.9% in value during the year, Norway’s central bank said on Thursday. The total gain was worth 1.07tn kroner (£91bn). However, the fund’s head said the appetite for market risk was “high” and warned that the buoyant investor mood would at some point come to an end. Nicolai Tangen told the Financial Times that the retail investor boom – exemplified by the GameStop furore – and the emergence of blank-cheque special purpose acquisition companies were signs of a high-risk market environment. “The positive developments we have seen in markets can’t, of course, go on forever,” he said. “What we are seeing now is indicative of the type of risk appetite there is. And the risk appetite is high. You see it through this type of situation such as Spacs [special purpose acquisition companies] and retail investors.” Norway founded the Government Pension Fund Global, also known as the oil fund, in 1990. It has grown into one of the biggest single stores of wealth in the world, and the largest sovereign wealth fund controlled by a country on behalf of its citizens. In 2017 its value surpassed $1tn (£730bn) for the first time. At that point the Economist magazine calculated that the citizens of Norway owned more than 1% of all the world’s shares. Despite its roots in oil wealth, the fund has turned in a different direction in recent years, including a 2019 pledge to divest its ownership of oil and gas producers’ shares.
The 10.9% gain for the fund was not a particularly extraordinary performance during a year in which the US benchmark stock market index, the S&P 500, gained more than 16%. However, the vast size of the fund meant the increase was notable. Its value on 31 December reached 10.9tn kroner, or £923bn – equal to assets worth £170,000 for each of Norway’s 5.3 million inhabitants. Global stock markets plunged in early 2020 as the extent of the coronavirus pandemic became clear, but staged a remarkable rebound from the end of March as central banks stepped in with huge stimulus efforts. That stimulus is thought by many economists and investors to have inflated the prices of many assets, such as those in companies such as Tesla, the electric carmaker, or GameStop, the US video game retailer at the centre of a retail investor frenzy. Some 72.8% of the fund was invested in equities, 2.5% in unlisted property, and 24.7% in fixed income such as government and corporate bonds. US technology in particular helped the fund, said Norway’s central bank, which manages it."

Wednesday’s announcement by the press secretary, Jen Psaki, came as the Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission said it was “aware of and actively monitoring the ongoing market volatility in the options and equities markets”. GameStop’s shares have soared this year as an army of small investors have bought in, hoping to profit from Wall Street bets that the company’s share price will fall. The company’s shares rose another 135% on Wednesday to more than $347, up from $3 last April. The battle between Wall Street and small investors who have gathered on Reddit to discuss tactics and celebrate their recent successes intensified on Wednesday when a US hedge fund that has invested heavily betting on the failure of the struggling video game store pulled out, costing the financial firm a fortune. Melvin Capital Management, one of a number of Wall Street firms that stood to make money for investors if GameStop’s shares plummet, told CNBC it has closed out its short position after taking a huge loss.
The hedge fund, which has lost 30% of the $12.5bn (£9.1bn) it manages this year, was outmanoeuvred by an army of Reddit users from the forum “Wall Street Bets”. The group sought to punish the financial giants betting against GameStop by sending the chain’s shares soaring. The David and Goliath battle has attracted the attention of Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX chief executive who earlier this month became the world’s richest person. He posted a tweet earlier this week about the company and its Reddit supporters, an intervention that reportedly helped the company’s stock surge 50% in after-hours trading on Tuesday. Musk, who is affectionately referred to as “Papa Musk” by supporters on the stock trading discussion group, tweeted the single word “Gamestonk” and a link to the Reddit group. “Stonks” is a tongue-in-cheek term for stocks that is widely used on social media.
The army of traders have declared war on the Wall Street companies looking to “short” GameStop, which involves “borrowing” a company’s shares and selling them with the intention of buying them back cheaper when the company’s share price falls, and it has proved to cost them billions. Last week, the short-seller Citron Research placed a bet against GameStop calling it a “failing mall-based retailer”, and predicted its shares would fall to $20 because it is “pretty much in terminal decline”. It prompted the Reddit traders to push the retailer’s stock through the roof, declaring: “We want to see the loss porn”, which resulted in the short-sellers being caught in what traders refer to as a “gamma squeeze” they cannot escape. Andrew Left, Citron’s founder, has now given up shorting the stock citing harassment by GameStop supporters, according to CNN. Melvin Capital threw in the towel just days after raising a $2.75bn bailout from backers including Point72 Asset Management, run by the New York Mets owner, Steve Cohen. A year ago shares in GameStop, which plans to close 450 stores this year, traded at $3.25 each. Now the 37-year-old chain is one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street, closing on Wednesday at $347.51, up more than 700% since 1 January. Supporters of GameStop are now in victory mode as the rocketing stock has seen its market value hit $22bn. The US betting site MyBookie has called it the “short squeeze of the century” and reckons GameStop’s stock is on track to hit $420-a-share by April. Amateur traders have been boasting of their wins, with one telling the Reddit forum: “I can now write my mom a check and put my sister through lymes [disease] treatment.” The meteoric rise has been fuelled by small investors snapping up the stock when it was cheap, using the trading app Robinhood and other services, seeing it as an opportunity to make money if the company can recover. Small investors began piling in last September after Ryan Cohen, founder of the online pet food giant Chewy, took a 13% stake in GameStop and began lobbying for it to go digital and become a serious rival to Amazon. However, analysts warn of concerns over a potentially unsustainable bubble emerging off the back of gossip over actual financial performance. “Amateur investors on social media platform Reddit are engaged in a battle with hedge funds which are shorting GameStop and several other stocks including Blackberry and Virgin Galactic,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. “[This] raises fears about a bubble in the markets given these stocks are being backed on little tangible news.” The Reddit chat room that drove the GameStop stock surges on Wednesday was briefly made private by its moderators, before being made public again. The page also said that it was facing technical difficulties due to an “unprecedented” scale of newfound interest in the server. Separately, Discord Inc, a messaging platform for online gamers, said it had removed the WallStreetBets server from its platform for violating its guidelines on hate speech and spreading misinformation. Discord said it had issued multiple warnings to the server admin before banning it. Reuters contributed reporting"
2021-01-28T07:00:04Z,business,Business,GameStop's three largest shareholders earn over $2bn amid stock surge,"The three largest shareholders in GameStop, the video game retailer at the center of a frenzied duel between Wall Street and small investors, have made more than $2bn from the company’s astronomic recent share rise. Stock in the company continued its vertiginous rise on Wednesday, hitting a fresh 52-week high of $354.83, making the 13% stake held by Ryan Cohen, 34, GameStop’s largest single shareholder, worth more than $1.3bn. Over the past two weeks, according to CNBC, Cohen’s net worth increased an average of $90m a day, or nearly $4m per hour, as GameStop stock has surged more than 1,550% this year alone. Other winners include Donald Foss, the 76-year-old founder and former CEO of Credit Acceptance Corp, a subprime auto lender. Foss bought 5% of GameStop early last year for about $12m. His stake is now worth more than $500m. GameStop’s chief executive, George Sherman, has seen his 3.4% stake jump to a value of about $350m.
On Reddit, where many of the small investors have strategized over their investments, small investors too have boasted of their outside gains from beating Wall Street. But some in Wall Street are also making huge gains. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, owned 9.2m shares in GameStop at the end of December, according to a regulatory filing. If it still holds all those shares, they were worth more than $3bn on Wednesday. The gains comes as thousands of small investors have poured into the stock and forced Wall Street hedge funds, including Melvin Capital and Citron, which were betting on GameStop’s collapse, to take billions in losses. The trading frenzy over GameStop drew comment from the incoming Biden administration on Wednesday with the treasury and other regulators announcing they were monitoring the situation. Cohen was a catalyst in the company’s phenomenal share price rise. Last year the investor and founder of Chewy, an online retailer of pet products, bought a stake in GameStop and launched a campaign for the company to move faster into the digital age to compete with Amazon. In January Cohen and two allies joined GameStop’s board. Despite the record rise in the company’s share price it is still planning to close up to 450 stores this year. On Wednesday evening, the Reddit message board that drove the GameStop stock surges was briefly made private. The page also said it had experienced an “unprecedented” scale of interest and was facing technical difficulties. Separately, the online gaming platform Discord said it had removed the WallStreetBets server from its platform for violating its guidelines on hate speech and spreading misinformation. Discord said it had issued multiple warnings to the server admin before banning it."
2021-01-28T00:01:01Z,business,Business,UK car production in 2020 slumped to lowest level since 1984,"UK car production slumped to its lowest level since 1984 last year amid the turmoil caused by the coronavirus pandemic, and Nissan overtook Jaguar Land Rover as the biggest British manufacturer. The output of British car factories dropped by 29% compared with the year before – to about 921,000. It was the first time annual production had fallen below 1m since 2009, during the depths of the financial crisis. The figures were “the worst in a generation”, said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the industry lobby group that compiled the data. Every major car plant in Europe shut its doors at the start of the pandemic, and in the UK some plants remained closed for months as they brought in new social distancing measures. UK car sales for 2020 were the lowest since 1992, hitting demand for the fifth of British-made cars that stay in their home market. The 300,000 drop in car output meant the industry lost about £10.5bn in revenues compared with 2019, Hawes said. The drop had a major effect on workers, with at least 10,000 car industry jobs lost during the year. However, the headline total may be an “iceberg”, Hawes said, with a significant number of redundancies hidden from view in supply chains where smaller companies may have had little choice but to cut back. Every large carmaker in the UK suffered steep production declines. At Vauxhall’s under-threat Ellesmere Port factory, production of the Astra car nearly halved. Production at Jaguar Land Rover’s three car plants fell by 37% to 244,000 cars, meaning it was narrowly overtaken by Nissan, whose Sunderland factory produced 246,000. Jaguar Land Rover has struggled particularly with production at its factory in Castle Bromwich in the West Midlands. Nissan’s newfound status as the UK’s largest carmaker came shortly after its chief operating officer, Ashwani Gupta, committed to production at Sunderland and said the Brexit deal would give it a competitive advantage over UK rivals. The UK’s departure from the EU’s single market on 31 December is causing problems for the industry. Sourcing parts from outside the EU, moving staff across the Channel, and gaining safety approvals for different models have all become more difficult. There have also been significant delays at the UK’s ports, disrupting automotive supply chains honed for just-in-time deliveries to factories. Many carmakers have resorted to flying parts in, Hawes said. Bentley and Jaguar Land Rover have both previously revealed such plans. Hawes hit back at comments from the government that minimised the negative impacts of Brexit for manufacturers, after the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said there “will be no non-tariff barriers to trade” and that issues at ports were “teething problems”. “There are non-tariff barriers,” said Hawes. “I would not characterise it as teething difficulties because this is a system that is going to be there for the foreseeable”. Some of the most notable barriers included administrative requirements for import and export, paperwork such as certifications and customs declarations, he said, adding that these hurdles would bring “additional cost that will have to be borne by industry for the foreseeable”. “They [carmakers] are working furiously to make sure supply chains can continue to operate,” he said. “As an industry we were as well prepared as any other sector but that doesn’t mean we could be fully prepared.” Hawes said the industry was “a bit more optimistic going into 2021” in the hope that vaccines will help economies to recover and because the Brexit deal, reached on Christmas Eve, removed the threat of tariffs on most UK exports – at least in the short term. Investment figures were another cause for cautious optimism, with pledges of £3.2bn during 2020 recovering to pre-Brexit-vote levels. However, the figures were boosted by Britishvolt, a startup aiming to build automotive battery “gigafactories” that has not yet funded its £2.6bn pledge. AutoAnalysis, a consultancy, forecast that UK production will bounce back to more than 1m cars during 2021, but the SMMT acknowledged that there are risks to that recovery. The permanent closure of Honda’s Swindon plant in the summer will add another obstacle, and a severe blow to the automotive supply chain. Honda started the plant in 1985, the year after output was last at 2020 lows."
2021-01-27T19:59:31Z,business,Business,GameStop's dizzying share price rise means it's game over for the short-sellers | Nils Pratley,"If you find trading bitcoin insufficiently hair-raising, try GameStop. It is the Texas-based video games retailer that will be hard to out-do as the stock market story of 2021. The share price was $19 at the start of this month but reached $330 in mid-afternoon on Wednesday in New York. There have been a few downwards lurches along the way, but the overall direction has been unsustainably upwards. It must be unsustainable because nothing of note has happened to improve GameStop’s commercial prospects so radically. Exciting PlayStation and Xbox releases may lie around the corner, but the company is still a bricks-and-mortar retailer struggling in an online age. Instead, punting on GameStop has become a video game in itself. One could call the game “burn the bears” – the bears being short-selling hedge funds who had bet last year that the share price had further to fall. They reckoned without a Reddit forum called r/WallStreetBets, where amateur traders gather, in this case to spot a daring counterattack – an uprising to propel the share price higher. You have to admire the imagination. Short-sellers had bet so heavily on catastrophe for GameStop that they were vulnerable to any sudden reversal. In the old days, private punters would not have been able to assemble enough collective financial firepower to make a difference. Now, like the professionals, they have access to financial leverage in form of zero-commission derivatives – futures and options – to throw a few sticks of dynamite into the mix. The explosion forced the hedge funds to cover their losses by buying stock, thereby adding to the upward momentum. The phenomenon is not new, but it’s hard to think of another example on this scale. Two hedge funds, at least, have been severely scalded, which, according to the subreddit, was half the point of the exercise. It was about getting one over on Wall Street. In that sense, it has succeeded to a degree that seemed impossible. And, since short-sellers are rarely popular, the world will not weep for the hedge fund losers. Instead, one reaction was to wonder where Reddit’s enterprising crew will strike next. BlackBerry, another heavily shorted stock, has seen similar dynamics. Even the 14% rise on Wednesday in Pearson, a member of the FTSE 100 index, was attributed to short-sellers running for the hills. Where does the tale go next? Well, despite calls for regulators to investigate possible market manipulation, that plot-line looks a non-starter. Amateurs communicating in chatrooms to talk up a stock does not amount to a conspiracy; the practice is as old as the internet. Instead, after a few more rounds of excitement, expect the game to stop in the traditional way: the late-comers to the party, and those staying until the end, will learn the hard way that a paper profit is not the same as cash. The smart money will be out by then, of course. But if GameStock’s common sense value is $2bn-ish – and not the $24.5bn implied by the share price on Wednesday – the crash will be brutal. Don’t blame AstraZeneca for the row with the EU Which side – AstraZeneca or the European Union – would you guess has read the vaccine supply contract correctly? The bet here is that AstraZeneca’s Pascal Soriot, a chief executive who has always been commendably uninterested in spin, was merely delivering some hard truths to Brussels in his interview with Italian newspaper La Repubblica on Tuesday. In short: AstraZeneca is obliged to use its “best effort” to meet the EU’s order on schedule and that, in the event of “glitches” in the dedicated EU plants, doses cannot be re-directed from the UK without the approval of the UK government. The EU’s position is that its own delivery terms are strict and, now that the EU plants can’t meet initial orders, UK sources should be tapped. It is possible the company signed two contracts that were ambiguous on this critical point. But it seems unlikely. Biological vaccines are hard to produce, especially at speed. The event that has occurred – delays in one dedicated supply chain – will surely have been anticipated and covered. It is also fairly clear the UK’s vaccine taskforce, which seems to have played a blinder, insisted that UK supplies should go to the UK first. Since that contract was signed three months before the EU one, AstraZeneca’s lawyers must have reflected the fact. The contract will probably be leaked by somebody soon enough. In the meantime, sympathies lie with AstraZeneca. Alongside Oxford University, it has worked wonders and does not deserve to be a political football."
2021-01-27T19:20:10Z,business,Business,JP Morgan to launch digital bank in UK,"The Wall Street company JP Morgan is to launch a new digital bank in the UK, in a move that threatens to shake up a banking sector still dominated by a handful of high street lenders. JP Morgan has already hired 400 staff for its soon-to-be-launched digital bank, which will be headquartered in Canary Wharf and operate under its consumer brand, Chase. The announcement confirms rumours about JP Morgan’s plans for a retail bank in Britain. Known only as “Project Dynamo”, Chase staff based in JP Morgan’s London offices had to keep their work under wraps for nearly two years. It will be the second major US lender to enter the UK retail banking market, since Goldman Sachs started offering Marcus-branded digital savings accounts 2018. Marcus has already lured in 500,000 UK customers by offering higher than average interest rates. It was forced to shut its doors to new British accounts due to a surge in demand last summer. In the US, Chase is one of the largest consumer banks in the country, serving nearly half of American households through online banking and 4,700 branches. But by offering online-only current accounts, Chase will be measured against British digital upstarts including Monzo, Starling and Revolut, which are trying to grab market share from the six largest lenders. HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest, Santander and Nationwide Building Society still hold roughly 87% of the retail banking market. JP Morgan said it plans to offer a “new take” on current accounts and said its new contact centre in Edinburgh will be a key selling point, offering “fast to access, personalised service around the clock.” The bank used part of its annual $11.8bn (£8.6bn) technology spending pot to build the UK Chase platform from scratch. Chase is now undergoing internal testing but is expected to launch later this year. “The UK has a vibrant and highly competitive consumer banking marketplace, which is why we’ve designed the bank from scratch to specifically meet the needs of customers here,” said Gordon Smith, co-president of JPMorgan. Chase has brought in seasoned City bankers to oversee its UK retail operations, including former Lloyds and Citibank chairman Win Bischoff, who will serve on the board and head up its risk committee. The former Financial Conduct Authority director, Clive Adamson, will chair the business, while the chief administrative officer of JP Morgan’s corporate and investment bank, Sanoke Viswanathan, will be chief executive. Although JP Morgan was forced to shift hundreds of UK investment bankers to EU offices due to Brexit, it said the launch of the retail bank was proof it was committed to the UK. The bank now employs about 19,000 people in Britain and is still hiring for the new retail operation. “Our decision to launch a digital retail bank in the UK is a milestone, introducing British consumers to our retail products for the first time,” said Daniel Pinto, JP Morgan’s London-based co-president. “This new endeavour underscores our commitment to a country where we have deep roots, thousands of employees and offices established for over 160 years.”"
2021-01-27T18:47:20Z,business,Business,Boeing 737 Max cleared to fly again by EU regulator,"Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft has been given the green light to return to the skies in the UK and the EU, after a 22-month grounding following two fatal crashes. The UK’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said on Wednesday it had lifted a ban on the 737 Max in UK airspace and that UK airlines would be allowed to fly it, shortly after the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) also issued its final approval. However, the CAA stressed that pilot training requirements meant it would be some time before the plane takes to the air in the UK. Marking a crucial step in its return to service, a modified version of the US company’s previously bestselling aeroplane has been given permission to fly again, although not until a package of checks and training is completed. The regulatory approvals came on the same day that Boeing revealed a net loss of $11.9bn (£8.7bn) for 2020, the largest in its history, as the coronavirus pandemic and the 737 Max caused revenues to slump by 24%. Richard Moriarty, the CAA’s chief executive, said: “Our thoughts remain with those affected by the tragic accidents of the Boeing 737 Max. This is not a decision we have taken lightly and we would not have allowed a return to service for UK operators, or lifted the ban on the aircraft operating in UK airspace, unless we were satisfied that the aircraft type is airworthy and can be operated safely.” The CAA regained the responsibility for supervising British airspace after the UK’s exit from the EU on 31 December. The CAA said the 737 Max will be “subject to close oversight” once it returns. Two airlines from the British Isles have 737 Max planes in their fleets: the Irish carrier Ryanair and the Anglo-German travel company Tui. British Airways has said it plans to buy 200 of the planes, but is yet to put in a firm order. Tui has said it will let customers change flights free of charge if they feel uncomfortable flying in the plane. Ryanair will let customers change from flights using the 737 Max to the next available flight for the first three months of operating the reapproved plane, after previously saying it would be unable to offer the facility. The regulators said each 737 Max aircraft would be required to undergo software upgrades, reworking of its electrical system, maintenance checks, operations manual updates and crew training before re-entering service.
As a result, in the EU each aircraft will have to undergo an updated airworthiness directive, which will be scheduled by the aircraft operators and overseen by the national aviation authority of each of the 27 EU member states, meaning it may also be some time before the 737 Max takes off again in Europe.
EASA and the CAA have followed in the footsteps of regulators in the US and Brazil in granting approval to the modified 737 Max. The decision to give approval was “a significant milestone on a long road”, said EASA’s executive director, Patrick Ky, adding that the regulator had not come under any pressure from Boeing or others to do so. “This assessment was carried out in full independence of Boeing or the Federal Aviation Administration and without any economic or political pressure – we asked difficult questions until we got answers and pushed for solutions which satisfied our exacting safety requirements,” Ky said.
The 737 Max was grounded globally in March 2019 after two plane crashes in the space of six months killed a total of 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia. The crashes were partly caused by a faulty sensor which repeatedly triggered a system, called MCAS, that pushed down the planes’ noses. Naoise Connolly Ryan, whose husband, Mick, died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, said families of the victims were not satisfied that they had been told fully what happened or why. Some of the families have objected to reapproval of the 737 Max. “Ultimately we are more determined than ever to find out exactly what Boeing knew about this dangerous aircraft, and hold them accountable for the deaths of our loved ones,” she said. A Boeing spokesperson said the lessons learned from the crashes had “reshaped our company and further focused our attention on our core values of safety, quality and integrity”, and said the company would continue to work closely with regulators. • This article was amended on 28 January 2021. A previous version said Ryanair would not let customers change from flights using the 737 Max. Ryanair has changed its policy to allow flight changes for the first three months of operation of the 737 Max."
2021-01-27T16:30:48Z,business,Business,"It's not just the pandemic, stupid. Australia's economy has been weak for years | Greg Jericho","One of the weird consequences of Covid-19 is that it has actually hidden the weakness of the economy. When things are going to hell due a pandemic, it gets all the blame, and yet, as the latest inflation figures show, Australia’s economy has been weak for many years now. The consumer price index figures for December, released yesterday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, show the continual impact of the pandemic. After a record fall of 1.9% in the June quarter last year, followed by an absurd 1.6% jump in September, the last three months of 2020 saw a 0.8% increase in prices:
And yet, even with prices rising 2.4% in just six months, annual inflation grew just 0.9% in 2020:
It is easy to excuse that pathetic result as being a case of “oh well, it’s the pandemic”. While of course the pandemic has had a massive impact, it is nowhere near the full story. The Reserve Bank’s underlying “trimmed mean” measure of inflation (or “core inflation), which removes the one-off and erratic rises and falls, shows that blaming all our problems on the pandemic is greatly misguided. In just one of the past 20 quarters core inflation has been above 0.5%. Given the bottom of the Reserve Bank’s target for annual inflation is 2%, that means we have now gone five years with inflation below the RBA’s target.
That low price growth reflects a lack of demand in the economy, a lack of wage growth and a decidedly limp state of economic affairs. It is also set to continue. The latest government bond yields, which are a good estimate of future inflation, suggest little hope of inflation going above 2% in the next year:
And even if we suggest that the annual CPI growth of 0.9% – up from 0.7% in September last year – shows some meagre sign of improvement, the reality is that, for Australians who don’t smoke (most of us), prices barely increased at all. Tobacco jumped 20% in price over the past year due to the latest excise increase, well above even the large 8% increase in beef and veal prices:
Tobacco price rises accounted for over 40% of the December increase in all of the CPI. Without tobacco, inflation was around 0.2% last year. If you had been wanting to save money, chicken, lamb and vegetables were the best things to eat, and washing it down with a beer, as its price rose less than other alcohol. The inflation figures also show how the real impact of the pandemic has been on services rather than goods. While the prices of goods did fall and rise a bit more than usual last year, it was nothing compared to the hit service prices took when lockdowns effectively prevented such activity:
These prices were also affected by government decisions – most crucially on childcare. Last year, when the government introduced a temporary period of free childcare, prices obviously plummeted. Now that the period is over they have steeply risen back to pre-pandemic levels:
Without the childcare rises, inflation in the December quarter would have been just 0.5% rather than 0.9%. This actually means that those non-smokers with no children in childcare saw prices rise just 0.1% in the last three months of 2020. These government decisions also affected price rises around the country. In the December quarter, Melbourne had the highest amount of inflation – with prices going up 1%. But much of that was due to childcare prices there rising more than other capital cities because Victoria’s lockdown kept childcare policies in place longer than other states. It meant childcare prices rose 208% in Melbourne in the December quarter compared with 18% in Sydney. But if we exclude childcare, Melbourne and Sydney’s inflation in December was essentially the same:
Perth was the only city to have overall prices fall in 2020. But again, this was due not to natural demand or supply, but the state government policy of offering a $600 electricity credit on 1 November. That had the impact of cutting electricity prices by two-thirds:
And so we continue to see the pandemic create a mess with the economic data – crazy price rises and falls due to lockdowns, and governments madly trying to come up with ways to abate the impact of income and job losses. But when we look through the extremes we see the same weak demand that was there well before the pandemic. A weakness that is now more than half a decade long."

A row over coronavirus vaccine shortages in the EU has descended into farce as AstraZeneca denied claims by the European commission that it had pulled out of a crunch meeting over a breakdown in supplies.
And here’s an explainer of the vaccines row.
Boeing’s 737 Max has been cleared to fly again by the European regulator after being grounded for 22 months following two fatal crashes.
Goldman Sachs has cut the pay of its chief executive, David Solomon, by $10m (£7.3m) after the bank was forced to pay billions of dollars to settle an international investigation into its role in the 1MDB scandal.
The Covid-19 pandemic could delay construction of the Hinkley Point C nuclear reactor by six months and raise its costs by £500m, according to its developer.

2021-01-27T15:09:47Z,business,Business,Why the EU and AstraZeneca are stuck in a Covid vaccines row,"The chief executive of AstraZeneca has dismissed suggestions that the UK is being unfairly prioritised for Covid-19 vaccine doses, in a wide-ranging interview revealing “glitches” that have constrained production. Pascal Soriot offered the deepest insight yet into a scientific process that has been dragged into the political sphere, as leaders in Brussels and several EU capitals voiced anger that Europe will not get the vaccine as quickly as hoped. He also talked about the “one-dose” strategy and the efficacy of the vaccine against new variants. Here is what we learned from Soriot’s comments, given to the Italian newspaper La Repubblica. Why are EU leaders angry? The EU ordered 80m doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine by the end of March but the Anglo-Swedish company has said it can only deliver 31m doses, with deliveries in the following quarter also likely to be 50% lower.
The escalating row, which comes ahead of a decision on Friday by the European Medicines Agency on whether to approve the vaccine, has even led to suggestions from Brussels that exports of doses from the EU could be banned. On Wednesday, the European commission said AstraZeneca had pulled out of talks set for the evening, only for the company to deny that minutes later, insisting the summit was still on. What does the company say? AstraZeneca’s contract with the EU is on a “best effort” basis, said Soriot, meaning the company is obliged to produce as much vaccine as it can but is not legally committed to fulfilling the order in the volumes the EU wanted. However, on Wednesday, European leaders said Soriot had misrepresented the contract and insisted the company had signed an “advance purchase agreement” promising it had enough capacity to deliver the order. Why have there been delays? AstraZeneca has suffered production problems at plants that make the vaccine for Europe, particularly at one site in Belgium. “We are basically two months behind where we wanted to be,” said Soriot. “The sites that have the lowest productivity in the network are the sites that are supplying Europe,” he added. The vaccine is made in two separate phases. The first is the “drug substance” – the vaccine itself – made for European distribution at plants in the Netherlands and Belgium. The second is the “drug product”, where the vaccine is taken to plants in Italy and Germany and put into vials to be distributed to different countries and, ultimately, to clinicians. The production problem, said Soriot, is with the first “drug substance” phase, the manufacture of the vaccine itself. AstraZeneca uses vast “cell cultures” in batches of up to 2,000 litres. The virus is injected into the cell cultures and the cells produce the vaccine. However, some plants produce a much higher yield of vaccine than others, up to three times as much. Why isn’t the UK affected? It is, or at least, it was. “We’ve had also teething issues like this in the UK supply chain,” said Soriot. The difference, he said, is that the UK signed its contract for 100m doses much earlier. As a result, there has been more time for production problems to be ironed out, meaning vaccine yields are higher. “So with the UK we have had an extra three months to fix all the glitches we experienced,” he said. Why did the UK move faster? Soriot declined to comment on the EU’s timing. But he said that when AstraZeneca began developing the vaccine in tandem with Oxford University, Oxford had already begun working with the UK government on plans for how to distribute the vaccine. AstraZeneca was able to take Oxford’s processes and scale them up. This headstart is what allowed production glitches to be fixed in the UK in time for the vaccine rollout. Where glitches persist at European sites, the later signing of the contract means there hasn’t yet been time to fix them. Can UK doses be diverted to Europe? In a word, no. “The UK agreement was reached in June, three months before the European one,” said Soriot. “As you could imagine, the UK government said the supply coming out of the UK supply chain would go to the UK first. Basically, that’s how it is.” AstraZeneca’s contract with the EU does raise the possibility that some of the vaccine made in the UK could be supplied to the EU, he said, but only once the contract with the UK government has been fulfilled. This, said Soriot, is “fair enough”. Is the “one-dose” strategy sensible? There has been disagreement over whether the UK was right to adopt a strategy of ensuring as many people as possible get their first dose and wait longer for a second, rather than administering both within a short timeframe. Soriot said he could not speak for the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines but said the “one-dose” strategy was “absolutely the right way to go” for AstraZeneca. The company believes one dose is 100% effective at stopping serious illness and hospitalisation and up to 73% efficient overall. A second dose, he said, would be needed for longer-term immunity. What about new variants? Soriot was asked about early signs that some vaccines are not as effective on new variants. The South African variant has been of particular concern. Soriot pointed out that the “neutralisation effect” of Moderna’s vaccine has been shown to be six times lower. Tests are still being done on AstraZeneca’s vaccine but he said it was “logical” to expect reduced efficacy. However, he said existing vaccines would probably still be able to control the virus enough to prevent serious illness, while the company will continue adapting vaccines to respond to new mutations."
2021-01-27T13:47:33Z,business,Business,"Keep Covid rescue programmes or risk triggering stock market crash, warns IMF","Governments and central banks must maintain their pandemic rescue programmes or risk triggering a stock market crash, the International Monetary Fund has said. Warning that there were legitimate concerns about a share price bubble, the Washington-based organisation said that without continued low interest rates and government subsidies it was possible a “correction” in stock markets would occur. In a report issued to coincide with the World Economic Forum, the IMF said investors had ignored recent data showing major economies slowing as the pandemic persisted through the winter months. There was also the prospect that vaccination programmes would take longer to deploy, especially across the developing world, forcing governments to maintain restrictions for a longer period. Financial markets have rebounded since last March and some have soared to fresh highs. The S&P 500, which accounts for a cross-section of the largest 500 US companies, slumped by a third last spring from a high before the pandemic of 3,386. Since then it has climbed to 3,849, up more than 13% from the level in February 2020. The FTSE 100 in London was at 7,534 in January last year and has struggled to recover from a drop in value of 2,500 points. It grew to a year’s high of 6,873 earlier this month before sliding to 6,638 this week. Tobias Adrian, the IMF’s head of financial stability, and his deputy, Fabio Natalucci, said in a blog to accompany the report that investors were able to bet on a “persistent policy backstop” and that a “sense of complacency appears to be permeating markets”. They said a herd mentality had gripped markets, which meant the majority of investors were ignoring warning signs of an economic slowdown and a longer climb back to pre-pandemic levels of activity. “This raises the risk of a market correction or ‘repricing’,” they said. “A sharp, sudden asset-price correction – for example, as a result of a persistent increase in interest rates – would cause a tightening of financial conditions. This could interact with existing financial vulnerabilities, creating knock-on effects on confidence and jeopardising macro-financial stability.” They said this left central banks with no option but to maintain low interest rates and governments to continue state support programmes, because to reduce their scope or generosity would cause a panic among investors. The report said a shortsighted approach to vaccinations that restricted access to developed countries was a particular threat. “Delayed access to comprehensive healthcare solutions could mean an incomplete global recovery and endanger the global financial system. With emerging market economies accounting for about 65% of global growth (about 40% excluding China) over 2017–19, delays in tackling the pandemic in such countries may bode ill for the global economy,” it said. “Supply chain disruptions could affect corporate profitability even in regions where the pandemic is under control. And because growth is a crucial ingredient for financial stability, an uneven and partial recovery risks jeopardising the health of the financial system.”"
2021-01-27T12:34:22Z,business,Business,Goldman Sachs cuts pay of chief executive David Solomon by $10m,"Goldman Sachs has cut the pay of its chief executive, David Solomon, by $10m (£7.3m) after the bank was forced to pay billions of dollars to settle an international investigation into its role in the 1MDB scandal. Solomon was still granted a $15.5m bonus on top of his $2m annual salary, in light of the investment bank’s bumper performance last year. It left Solomon with a pay packet totalling $17.5m, compared with $27.5m in 2019. Solomon’s pay is nearly half the size of the $31.5m package handed to JP Morgan’s chief, Jamie Dimon. Morgan Stanley’s boss, James Gorman, surpassed both rivals after receiving $33m. A strong showing by Goldman’s investment division in 2020helped the bank beat expectations with a 12% rise in full-year profits to $9.5bn. The lender more than doubled its profits and reported record revenues in the fourth quarter. Goldman announced in October that it was cutting executive pay by a combined $31m, after reaching a $2.9bn settlement with global regulators and the US Department of Justice over its alleged role in the 1MDB corruption scandal. Months earlier, Goldman agreed to pay $3.9bn to the Malaysian government, after claims it allegedly failed to act while $4.5bn was looted from the country’s sovereign wealth fund. Goldman underwrote and arranged bond sales for the fund and earned $600m in fees for helping raise the cash, according to the DoJ. In regulatory filings released overnight, Goldman Sachs explained that none of the current executives, including Solomon, were involved or aware of the bank’s participation “in any illicit activity” regarding the arranging of bond sales for 1MDB. However, the bank’s board said it “views the 1MDB matter as an institutional failure, inconsistent with the high expectations it has for the firm.” Goldman’s president and chief operating officer, John Waldron, and its chief financial officer, Stephen Scherr, each had their pay reduced by $7m, leaving them with pay packets worth $18.5m and $15.5m respectively. In total, the Wall Street bank is trying to claw back a total of $174m from a dozen current and former executives."
2021-01-27T11:10:06Z,business,Business,Sales surge for sofa firm ScS as lockdowns put focus on homes,"The sofa retailer ScS experienced a surge in sales over the past six months as locked-down consumers opted to spend money on new furniture for their homes. Gross sales at ScS rose by 13.9% over the 26 weeks to 23 January to reach £182.3m, compared with sales of £160m a year earlier.
However, the company, one of the UK’s largest retailers of upholstered furniture, and flooring, said new orders had slumped over the past month, with renewed coronavirus restrictions forcing ScS to close its stores during its winter sale. The retailer experienced a significant increase in new orders in June and July 2020 after the first lockdown, thanks to pent-up demand. The majority of ScS’s customers chose to wait until stores reopened to try out its fabric and leather sofas in person, before making the decision about which one to buy. ScS said it had also experienced strong trading in the first quarter of the current financial year, pushing its order book to £90.5m, including VAT, on 23 January this year, £16.8m higher than at the same point a year earlier. However, the intake of new orders at the group decreased by 65% between 20 December and 23 January, compared with a year earlier, as the impact of renewed store closures took a toll. As a result, the order intake during the six months from 26 July ended up 9% lower than a year earlier. ScS said more than half (57) of its 100 stores were able to trade on Boxing Day, when it began its winter sale, and the shops traded well while they were open. However, further restrictions meant that all of its branches closed by 4 January.
The group’s website has picked up some of the slack during repeated store closures, and online orders rose by 98% compared with the same period a year earlier. The company’s distribution centres have remained open during the current Covid-19 restrictions, in line with government guidelines, which was not the case during the first national lockdown, allowing the company to continue delivering products to its customers. Despite repeated store closures, ScS said it remained cautiously optimistic about the firm’s outlook, thanks to the strong trading it had seen once previous coronavirus restrictions were lifted."
2021-01-27T10:00:28Z,business,Business,How GameStop found itself at the center of a groundbreaking battle between Wall Street and small investors,"The coronavirus pandemic hit GameStop hard. Like many retailers, already suffering from the shift to online sales, the video games chain is losing money and plans to close 450 stores this year. And yet, surprisingly, GameStop has become one the hottest stocks of the year. The 37-year-old chain store group is now the focus of a David-and-Goliath battle between an army of small investors and Wall Street that shows no signs of abating and has highlighted some fundamental shifts in investing. Last April, when the company announced mass closures, GameStop’s shares (GME) could be bought for $3.25 each. On Tuesday they soared another 92% to end the day at close to $148, pumped up again by small investors hoping to ruin Wall Street bets that the price would crash. It’s a bet that has, so far, proved very costly for the professional financiers.
The strange saga of GameStop’s cult status can be traced back to last September, when Ryan Cohen – investor and founder of the online pet food giant Chewy – took a 13% stake in the retailer and started lobbying for it to move more of its business online and become a serious rival to Amazon. Cohen and two associates were added to the company’s board in January. The company’s share price began to soar as small investors snapped up a cheap stock using the trading app Robinhood and other services, seizing on what they saw as an ideal buying opportunity. Wall Street saw something else – a chance to “short” an ambitious bet against Amazon they believed was bound to fail. Shorting a stock is risky. It involves “borrowing” a company’s shares and selling them with the intention of buying them back cheaper when the share price falls. Many Wall Street fortunes have been made this way, but if the price doesn’t fall, the losses can be huge. About 71.66m GameStop shares are currently shorted – worth about $4.66bn. Year-to-date, those bets have cost investors about $6.12bn, which includes a loss of $2.79bn on Monday. Monday’s 145% price rise came in less than two hours, extending GameStop’s gains for the year to more than 300%. On Tuesday, the party continued. When, and how, it ends is anyone’s guess. Amid manic trading, the New York stock exchange halted trading nine times. “We broke it. We broke GME [GameStop’s stock market ticker] at open,” one Reddit user wrote on Monday after the NYSE halted trading. Ihor Dusaniwsky, a managing director at the data analytics company S3 Partners, called the situation “unique”. Established investors were still betting that the company’s sky-high share price would – eventually – collapse, ignoring earlier losses “and using any stock borrows that become available to initiate new short positions in hopes of an eventual pullback from this stratospheric stock price move,” he said. “Much like the revolutionary war, the first line of troops goes down in a rain of musket fire but is replaced by the troops next in line,” Dusaniwsky added. The battle has become a war of attrition between a new generation of investors and established, more diversified players. Investors on the WallStreetBets subreddit forum have been promoting GameStop aggressively, with many pitching it as a battle of regular people versus hedge funds and big Wall Street firms. “This is quite the experience for my first month in the stock market. Holding till infinity,” posted one user on the thread. Another user said: “We’re literally more powerful than the big firms right now.” In some cases, they’ve been right, with larger investors like Citron Research taking a sharp lesson in what can happen when “herd investors” squeeze a stock higher. Citron’s founder, Andrew Left, called GameStop a “failing mall-based retailer” in a report earlier this month and then predicted that the stock would plunge to $20 in a video he posted to Twitter on Thursday. According to CNN, Left has now given up on shorting the stock, citing harassment by the stock’s backers.
Another loser is Melvin Capital Management, a hedge fund that has lost 30% of $12.5bn under management this year on a series of short positions, including exposure to GME. On Monday, Citadel LLC and its partners announced it would invest $2bn in Melvin, and Point72 Asset Management (the New York Mets owner Steve Cohen’s firm) would invest an additional $750m on top of $1bn already in the fund. “As someone who started trading stocks in the late 90s in college, I would always remember watching when the small retail trading groups would get crushed by hedge funds and savvy short-sellers,” Oanda market analyst Edward Moya said in a report. “What happened with GameStop’s stock is a reminder of how times are changing.” The battle has spread further, with some accusing the financial media of backing institutional Wall Street players. In an open letter to CNBC, one Reddit user wrote: “Your contempt for the retail investor (your audience) is palpable and if you don’t get it together, you’ll lose an entire new generation of investors.” But others warned that conditions represent market intoxication. “This is the new day and age in which no one listens to the analysts: ‘Why bother, let’s just go out and buy it ourselves?’” Lars Skovgaard Andersen, investment strategist at Danske Bank Wealth Management, told the Wall Street Journal. “It is a sign of high complacency.” The short-squeeze war over GameStop stock is just the latest in a series of conflicts perhaps exemplified by the war over Tesla stock. Last year, short-sellers of the electric vehicle maker lost $38bn, which S3’s Dusaniwsky called “the largest yearly mark-to-market loss I have ever seen”. It is too early to say how long the GameStop saga will continue, or how it will end, but some analysts believe both sides in this skirmish could learn some hard lessons. “I think the millennials will temporarily be rewarded, and a short-squeeze is definitely conceivable,” the investor Erika Safran at Safran Wealth Advisors said. “The stock can get pushed up so that at some point the short-sellers will fold and make the stock go higher. Eventually, it may trend down to the fundamentals of what a stock like this is willing to accept.” Safran has in the past warned that Robinhood, the vehicle many long-investors are using to make trades in GameStop, is behind investment strategies that financial planners generally warn against. “It’s ironic to me and other professional advisers that over decades we have moved away from an individual stock-picking philosophy to broad stock diversification, and this is the exact opposite,” Safran says. “Investing is not just buying one stock.” Safran says the strategy of driving up a stock in the hope of forcing a short-squeeze and riding an a individual stock are hallmarks of a conflict between the new, individual investment strategy and the old guard that recognized financial success requires diversification. “Someone’s got to be wrong, but that’s what makes a market,” Safran says. “I think it will be an education for some and a good story for everyone else.”"
2021-01-27T02:02:35Z,business,Business,Rating agency S&P warns 13 oil and gas companies they risk downgrades as renewables pick up steam,"Rating agency S&P has warned 13 oil and gas companies, including the some of the world’s biggest, that it may downgrade them within weeks because of increasing competition from renewable energy. On notice of a possible downgrade are Australia’s Woodside Petroleum as well as multinationals Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Imperial Oil, Royal Dutch Shell, Shell Energy North America, Canadian Natural Resources, ConocoPhillips and French group Total. S&P said it was also considering downgrading four large Chinese producers – China Petrochemical Corp, China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, China National Offshore Oil Corp and CNOOC.
The rating agency said it had increased its risk rating for the entire oil and gas sector from “intermediate” to “moderately high” because due to the move away from fossil fuels, poor profitability and volatile prices. It said it also had a negative outlook for two other big oil and gas companies, British multinational BP and Canadian group Suncor, but did not plan to immediately reassess their credit ratings.
“In particular, we note significant challenges and uncertainties engendered by the energy transition, including market declines due to growth of renewables; pressures on profitability, specifically return on capital, as a result of high dollar capital investment levels over 2005-2015 and lower average oil and gas prices since 2014; and recent and potential oil and gas price volatility,” S&P said on Wednesday. It said it did not plan to downgrade companies by more than one notch as a result of the risk to the industry as a whole. “This said, we cannot exclude a combination of the industry risk revision and other material factors leading to a two-notch downgrade, especially given the potential for negative surprises after the Covid-19 impacts in 2020,” it said. A two-notch downgrade would put Woodside at BBB-, which is one notch above a junk rating. Woodside shares fell 3.25% on Wednesday morning.
A lower credit rating can make it harder or more expensive for companies to borrow money. In particular, many fund managers will not invest in companies with a junk rating. S&P’s move came after the world’s biggest funds manager, BlackRock, said it might dump shares in big greenhouse gas emitters in support of limiting global heating to 1.5C by 2050. “I believe that the pandemic has presented such an existential crisis – such a stark reminder of our fragility – that it has driven us to confront the global threat of climate change more forcefully and to consider how, like the pandemic, it will alter our lives,” BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink said in a letter to CEOs."
2021-01-27T00:01:16Z,business,Business,Gordon Brown calls for urgent budget help as 1 in 7 UK firms face collapse,"Gordon Brown has called for emergency measures to support businesses in the budget after new research from the London School of Economics warned almost 1m UK companies were at risk of failure in the next three months. The former prime minister said the report’s finding that one in seven businesses – employing 2.5 million people – might be forced to close by the spring should act as a “clarion call” to Rishi Sunak as he prepares his tax and spending measures for 3 March.
Brown, who was prime minister at the time of the global financial crisis in 2008, said: “Governments cannot afford to be behind the curve – especially in a crisis. They have to be at least two steps ahead.” Using data published by the Office for National Statistics, the LSE report found that the UK’s micro businesses – those with less than 10 employees – were at particular risk of going under as a result of damage caused by the Covid-19 crisis. It estimated that 908,000 firms could be classified as at risk because they had either no confidence or low confidence in surviving the next three months. Of the total, 390,000 were registered for VAT and PAYE, while the remainder were unregistered because their turnover was too small. The report was prepared for the Alliance for Full Employment, a body founded by Brown that includes metro mayors and the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford. A separate report by the corporate recovery specialists Begbies Traynor found that 620,000 small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) were in “significant financial distress”, putting 2.8m jobs at risk. Brown said it was clear many businesses were on a “cliff edge” and that a major collapse would occur without government action.
“If we are to save good small businesses that are innovative and forward looking but which, without help with their investment plans, are in danger of going under, the budget must bring forward measures. It is time to offer new hope to what will otherwise be dying firms.” Sunak has offered a range of support to businesses since the pandemic first arrived in the UK early last year. In addition to the furlough scheme, the Treasury’s package of measures has included grants, loan guarantees, a business rates holiday, deferral of VAT payments, and a VAT cut for the hardest-hit sectors. The LSE report said the chancellor needed to extend the scale and duration of government support, proposing a continuation of loan subsidies; and debt restructuring during the UK’s eventual recovery that would involve exchanging government loans for government equity stakes. Prof John Van Reenen, one of the authors of the LSE report, said: “Without further policy action, businesses face a cruel spring of bankruptcy.”"
2021-01-26T19:49:52Z,business,Business,HSBC denies taking political stance over China's crackdown in Hong Kong,"HSBC’s chief executive has denied taking a political stance on China’s crackdown in Hong Kong, claiming the bank was not in a position to question police requests when it agreed to freeze accounts of pro-democracy activists. Questioned by MPs on the foreign affairs committee on Tuesday, Noel Quinn ruled out exiting the Hong Kong market in light of Beijing’s controversial new security laws, saying it “would only harm” local customers.
In a 90-minute exchange that left many MPs exasperated, the HSBC boss repeatedly refused to comment on issues of “democracy or political systems” and said his main motivation was to help Hong Kong’s economy and its citizens “through the current challenges”. The London-headquartered bank has come under fire not only for backing the security law, but freezing the accounts of pro-democracy protesters – including veteran activist Ted Hui – who critics claim are the real target of Beijing’s crackdown. The bank has also been accused of protecting its own interests in Hong Kong, where it employs about 30,000 of its 235,000 global staff and makes more than half its profits. But Quinn said the bank was not singling out activists, and was merely following police orders as it would in any of its markets, including the UK. “I cannot cherrypick which law to follow,” he said. MPs pushed Quinn to justify his decision to support the security law, and allow his Asia-Pacific chief executive, Peter Wong, to sign a petition backing Beijing’s new rules. HSBC’s statement at the time said it would “respect and support laws” that would help the territory “recover and rebuild.” Quinn said on Tuesday that the bank had hoped the security law would restore calm in a city that had faced months of disruption due to pro-democracy protests. “We had to ask 30,000 people to work from home because they were afraid to travel on public transport. Buildings were being firebombed,” he said. “We believe that it was appropriate to stabilise the security position in Hong Kong,” Quinn added. The Labour MP, Chris Bryant, claimed HSBC seemed to “adopt a moral stance when it suits you, but not when it doesn’t”.
However, Quinn defended the bank’s decision: “It’s not my position to make a moral or political judgment on these matters, I have to comply with the law.” He quashed rumours that HSBC may consider splitting its Asian and western operations, or pulling out of Hong Kong entirely, to avoid the reputational damage of being associated with China’s anti-democratic crackdown. Quinn said pulling out of the territory “would only harm” customers. “I am nowhere near the point at which the challenges Hong Kong faces would even give me any hints or consideration of walking away from Hong Kong. We’re committed to it.”"
2021-01-26T19:44:14Z,business,Business,"Caught between China and the US, the pressure for HSBC to split grows | Nils Pratley","Noel Quinn, chief executive of HSBC, had his line and he stuck to it. He was just a humble banker, obeying the rules in Hong Kong, even the draconian ones imposed by Beijing that stamp out the last knockings of democracy. “It’s not my position to make moral or political judgments on these matters,” he told the foreign affairs select committee. “I have to comply with law.” One matter in question was HSBC’s freezing of the bank account of pro-democracy activist Ted Hui. It was the Hong Kong police that told HSBC to act, said Quinn, and any bank would have to do the same. Not complying, he argued repeatedly, could ultimately mean losing the licence to operate. This straight-bat defence was what you’d expect, of course, and Quinn only looked discomforted when invited to defend the decision of Peter Wong, HSBC’s top executive in Asia, to sign a petition last year supporting China’s new powers for Hong Kong. Quinn argued that Wong was merely signing as a citizen of Hong Kong and, absurdly, that the act was not political. “I think our definition of what is political may be slightly different,” replied committee chair Tom Tugendhat. Quite. An hour of questioning by MPs is the least of HSBC’s troubles, however. The wider question is whether a 150-year-old institution can maintain its double life as a UK-regulated bank that makes most of its money in Hong Kong. “I do not see a point where we will have to split the institution into two,” said Quinn. Again, he’s bound to say that – appearances must be maintained. But, come on, it’s easy to imagine circumstances in which a split could become necessary. For starters, US-China relations could deteriorate further, making the bank an even bigger political football. Remember, HSBC also needs a licence to clear US dollars. The other important party is the shareholders. It is hard to judge the degree of “Hong Kong discount” in HSBC’s share price, but it’s not nil. If a split comes to be seen as a way to restore value, there will be pressure. Quinn can opine unconvincingly about staying out of politics, but it’s really not that simple. BlackRock talk the talk It was good news, of course, when BlackRock finally started talking seriously about climate risks a year ago – even if the world’s biggest fund manager was years behind most big European rivals in doing so. The company, with an astonishing $8.7tn under management, is still not at the radical end of the spectrum but it has moved. There is a greater willingness these days to side with activists on shareholder-led climate proposals, for example. Chief executive Larry Fink’s latest annual “dear CEO” letter contained two new ideas. First, BlackRock will push companies harder to commit to business plans that align with net zero emissions by 2050. And, in its actively managed funds, the firm is threatening to dump the worst polluters. The second proposal is more interesting but needs to be seen in context. BlackRock is predominately an index-tracking operation – that is where 90% of its equities are held. Thus divestment is not an option for that portion, even if clients can be encouraged to switch into passively managed funds with ESG (environmental, social and governance) overlays. But the actively managed funds are still big in their own right, and some holdings in polluters will be so significant that BlackRock’s departure could affect the price at which those companies can raise capital. But, to be taken seriously, the weapon has to be used occasionally. The divestment threat was merely a couple of lines in Fink’s letter. Let’s see if he really means it.
Saga’s all at sea There is “pent-up demand for cruises among our guests who will benefit from the first round of vaccine rollout,” says Saga. It wants to get them at sea as early as May. The timetable looks ambitious since it surely depends not only on the punters’ willingness to travel but also on other countries’ willingness to let them land to inspect the local sites. If destinations are still locked-down, a boatload of UK tourists, even ones waving vaccination certificates, may not get a welcome. Still, if Saga is right about pent-up demand, it sends a bullish signal for the rest of the travel market. Cruise ships, as floating super-spreaders, did not have a good press during the early stage of the pandemic. If the passengers are undeterred, budget airlines can expect a boom."
2021-01-26T16:30:07Z,business,Business,Two Coalition MPs urge further bailouts for Australia's Covid-hit tourism industry,"Two Coalition MPs are calling for the Australian tourism industry to receive further bailouts after jobkeeper finishes in March because domestic holidaymakers can’t fill the void left by lost international revenue. The assertion by Warren Entsch and Llew O’Brien is backed by the infrastructure department in its submission to a parliamentary inquiry on the future of aviation, which warned that domestic trips “tend to be shorter, lower yield and involve fewer activities”. The submission also said the industry may suffer from fewer business trips and “a hesitation among holidaymakers and visiting friends and relatives to fly”.
The Morrison government has sent mixed signals about whether it will bail out the tourism industry when jobkeeper wage subsidies expire in March. After a fall in unemployment in the December quarter Scott Morrison said businesses should only count on existing supports. But the new tourism minister, Dan Tehan, confirmed the government was considering targeted support because international travel was likely to remain restricted for up to a year. The department submitted that there was “no clear pathway to full reopening of international aviation”. Even though domestic tourism was expected to recover, “until a vaccine is widely available there remains the continued risk of Covid-19 outbreaks and recurring travel restrictions”, it said. The department noted 84% of domestic flights in 2019 were for overnight trips, half of which were for business, meaning the industry was vulnerable to a structural shift away from in-person to remote business meetings. Aviation demand could also be held back by lower incomes and fears of Covid-19 transmission, it said. Aviation could be boosted by lower prices due to cheaper oil, pent-up demand for visits to family and friends, and substitution towards domestic tourism. The department cited Tourism Research Australia that nine million international visitors came to Australia in 2019, spending a total of $45bn, “significantly less” than the $65bn spent by Australians on 11.6 million outbound trips. But it warned that “domestic tourists have different travelling and spending patterns to those travelling overseas: trips tend to be shorter, lower yield and involve fewer activities”. The Nationals MP Llew O’Brien told Guardian Australia businesses in his electorate of Wide Bay were “doing OK”, thanks to “a lot more domestic tourism from Brisbane up to Noosa” although other areas such as Fraser Island were finding it more difficult without international visitors. Tourism operators, such as boat tours, reported business was “basically dead”, he said, because domestic tourists “are coming for relaxation and less for the experience of discovery” to destinations that were already more familiar to them, a few hours from home. “If a business can demonstrate a direct link to Covid-19 that has seen them down 30% [of revenue] or more … I’m favouring, and will advocate, that they deserve further assistance,” O’Brien said. “If, on the other hand, there is a long-term structural change and they will never recover then we still need to help them transition, to give some assistance, or people will go to the wall.” The Liberal MP Warren Entsch said it was “absolutely true” that Australians spent less on domestic holidays. Tourism businesses in Entsch’s far northern Queensland seat of Leichhardt have had “mixed” results with smaller operations catering to locals such as bed and breakfasts doing well, while “for bigger operations geared for mass tourism – it’s been a disaster”. Entsch cited “big marine operators” and the Tjapukai Aboriginal Cultural Park – which shut down after 30 years of operation – as among those hardest hit due to reliance on international tourists. Entsch said tourists from Victoria and New South Wales had been “reluctant to travel” because state government policies had “open and shut, open and shut” the borders, or forced travellers into quarantine after outbreaks. “Brisbane to Cairns is one of the busiest routes in Australia right now, but there’s got to be confidence that when people book a holiday they can actually go on it. “Border restrictions have been a hell of a whack on confidence and people are reluctant to hop on a plane.”
Entsch said there “has to be some level of support ongoing past March, there’s no question about that”, citing big tour operators, entertainers and the arts as areas that would need payments after jobkeeper ends. “The biggest thing the government can do is roll out these bloody vaccines – if it does what it’s supposed to that will allow the industry to open back [up], but there are still a lot of ifs.” The Transport Workers Union has led a charge for the government to extend jobkeeper to all aviation workers until domestic and international borders are open and flights return to normal. The call has been backed by Virgin Australia, cargo service provider Swissport, and airline service companies Dnata and Gate Gourmet. In a letter sent on Friday, the group warned the aviation industry had “lost at least 11,000 aviation workers to redundancies” during the pandemic and “a further 2,500 ground handling and cleaning workers have been outsourced by Qantas”. The Tourism and Transport forum has also called for an extension of jobkeeper, warning that according to modelling by Stafford Strategy the tourism industry could lose 320,000 jobs by September 2021 without further wage subsidies."

It downgraded the UK recovery but raised its global outlook, expressing hope that Covid-19 vaccines will power the world economic recovery, despite concerns over the new, more transmissible Covid-19 strains. The IMF also pointed to fresh stimulus packages from the US and Japanese governments. The US consumer confidence index from the Conference Board showed a slight improvement in January, but December was revised lower.

2021-01-26T14:43:05Z,business,Business,'An absolute killer': small UK firms struggle with Brexit VAT rules,"Small British businesses exporting to the EU are struggling to navigate a new VAT regime, with one tax advisory firm receiving up to 200 calls a week from worried companies. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said its members are facing “significant issues” as a result of leaving the EU VAT area. “Businesses just did not have enough time to prepare for this,” said Selwyn Stein, managing director of VAT IT, a firm that helps reclaim the sales tax. “They’re being hit by a rulebook from 27 separate countries, when they are used to dealing with the EU as a single bloc. “They are calling us in a panic because their goods have been stopped and they don’t know what to do,” he said. “They have become fearful about trading so are stopping shipments until they have a resolution.” The UK is no longer part of the single EU VAT area, which means the sales tax is now collected by each country. Bills must be settled upfront by the buyer, with a lack of preparedness on the part of exporters and purchasers resulting in shock demands for payment at the border in recent days. Many small firms are having to consider registering for VAT in multiple jurisdictions for volumes in sales that are often relatively low, according to the FSB, which said the extra administrative burden could be off-putting.
Phil Ward, managing director of Bristol-based firm Eskimo, which sells designer radiators for up to £4,000, said he is considering moving some of its manufacturing to Poland to stay competitive. Brexit had dealt his business a blow, because the EU accounted for 25%-45% of its sales. Eskimo has not exported anything so far this year as its main distributor has been unable to find a carrier willing to take the job.“We are the only designer and manufacturer of posh radiators in the UK – everything else is imported from Turkey or Italy,” said Ward, who is concerned it is a “hell of a lot more difficult” for EU buyers to deal with a British company than its main rivals, which are based in Italy. Leaving the bloc also means UK firms can no longer exploit the VAT triangulation scheme, which makes cross-border trade easier between EU countries. David Lee, managing director of Torqueflow-Sydex, an engineering company, said it is now charged VAT at 22% on goods manufactured by its Italian sister company, which are then sold to another EU country, because it is a UK entity. “This is adding 22% on to our costs, which in a competitive market is an absolute killer,” said Lee. Lee’s company’s options include directing shipments via the UK or registering as a tax entity in every EU country it trades with. “I’ve been in the industry for over 30 years, working with Australia, Russia and the Middle East – this just makes everything look a joke,” he said. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said help was available via a dedicated HMRC phone line and online at gov.uk. “Now the UK has left the EU customs union and single market, there are new rules and processes businesses will need to follow,” they said. “The Government will continue to work closely with businesses to ensure they are able to trade effectively under the new rules.”"

2021-01-26T13:07:02Z,business,Business,IMF downgrades forecast for UK economic recovery,"The International Monetary Fund has downgraded forecasts for the UK’s recovery this year while the expansion of the global economy, aided by accelerating vaccine rollouts, is expected to gather pace. Illustrating the severe impact of the pandemic on the UK economy, the IMF said in its latest forecast that the UK’s national income, or GDP, would expand by 4.5% this year, down 1.4 percentage points from the 5.9% growth forecast made last October. It follows an estimated contraction in UK GDP of 10% in 2020, the biggest fall of any G7 country. The global economy, helped in part by improved outlooks in the US and Japan, will recover from a 3.5% fall in GDP in 2020 with growth of 5.5% in 2021, up 0.3 percentage points compared with October’s forecast.
The US economy is forecast to grow by 5.1% in 2021, while Japan’s economy is expected to expand by 3.1%. GDP in the eurozone is forecast to rise by 4.2% this year. In an update to its flagship world economic outlook, the Washington DC-based IMF said the upgrade in global growth, while modest, reflected an increase in government spending to offset the worst effects of the pandemic and vaccination programmes that were being rolled out across richer nations. Close to 90 million people were likely to fall below the extreme poverty threshold during 2020–21, the report said. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director, has urged governments to expand healthcare provision and welfare policies to protect vulnerable groups to limit an expected growing divide between rich and poor during the pandemic. At the weekend, ahead of the World Economic Forum’s annual summit this week, she said governments must not let the pandemic affect efforts to tackle poverty and the climate emergency. Speaking to the Guardian, she said: “Building resilience can be good for nature and ecosystems; it can be good for economic growth; at a time when economies have lost low-skilled jobs, it boosts job creation; and the fourth win is that it can bring health benefits [such as reduced air pollution].” There were risks to the outlook from variants of Covid-19 that could prove difficult to treat and vaccinate against, the IMF said, but other risks had diminished, including the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. With the Biden administration poised to pump an extra $1.9tn (£1.4bn) into the US economy and Chinese economic growth likely to surge to 8.6% this year, much of it after a huge boost from state-sponsored investment, the prospect for higher growth than predicted last October had improved. “The upgrade is particularly large for the advanced economy group, reflecting additional [government] support – mostly in the United States and Japan – together with expectations of earlier widespread vaccine availability compared to the emerging market and developing economy group,” the report said. The UK’s acceleration of its vaccination programme is not expected to give an extra boost to UK growth until 2022 when its growth rate is upgraded by 1.8 percentage points to 5%. Concerns that inflation is likely to take off over the next 12 months as the recovery gains speed were dispelled by the IMF, which said average prices would not increase by more than 1.5% over the two-year forecast period.
There would be an increase in oil prices and the cost of commodities such as metals, but they would remain below 2019 levels and allow central banks to maintain ultra low interest rates for at least a couple of years. Global trade would recover by 8% this year before falling back to 6% growth in 2020, largely following a slow recovery in services and especially tourism. “Services trade is expected to recover more slowly than merchandise volumes, which is consistent with subdued cross-border tourism and business travel until transmission declines everywhere,” the IMF said."
2021-01-26T13:00:03Z,business,Business,Asset manager BlackRock threatens to sell shares in worst climate polluters,"BlackRock, the world’s biggest investment fund manager, has threatened to sell shares in the worst corporate pollutersin a bid to support the goal of net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s chief executive, said the investor would ask companies whose shares it holds to disclose their plans to achieve net zero emissions. The new approach is set out in Fink’s annual letter to CEOs around the world. BlackRock could then divest from polluting companies in its actively managed funds – which represent about a tenth of its assets – if they did not improve. BlackRock has significant influence with companies, investors and governments because of the vast array of shares, bonds and other assets its controls, worth $8.7tn (£6.4tn) at the end of December. Its size makes it a major player in sustainable investment, although only $616bn of its assets, about 7%, are managed with environmental, social or governance criteria taken into account. Fink said the coronavirus pandemic had increased the focus on the climate crisis among investors. “I believe that the pandemic has presented such an existential crisis – such a stark reminder of our fragility – that it has driven us to confront the global threat of climate change more forcefully and to consider how, like the pandemic, it will alter our lives,” wrote. “No issue ranks higher than climate change on our clients’ lists of priorities.”
BlackRock has faced significant pressure from environmental activists to improve its record on climate action, given its role as the biggest controller of shares and bonds in the world, including vast holdings of fossil fuel companies. The pledge to support net zero by 2050 brings BlackRock in line with commitments by more than 100 countries around the world, and with some of its big rivals which have already vowed not to invest in companies that pollute by 2050. Other investors have gone further. New York City on Monday announced that two of its pension funds for employees and teachers had voted to divest holdings worth $4bn in fossil fuel companies. “Fossil fuels are not only bad for our planet and our frontline communities, they are a bad investment,” said New York’s mayor, Bill de Blasio. Part of BlackRock’s pledge will mean taking a more muscular role in its dealings with the companies whose shares it holds, including an increased willingness to vote against boards and in favour of climate resolutions and the “potential exit” from companies who do not try to improve. It will focus its efforts on 1,000 companies – up from 440 during 2020 – who together account for 90% of emissions from BlackRock’s portfolio.
The asset manager last year pledged to divest from companies who made more than 25% of their revenues from thermal coal, but the latest decision to threaten further divestments represents a stronger signal particularly to oil and gas extractors who do not have a plan for net zero emissions. However, the company will retain vast holdings in fossil fuel companies because of its role in providing funds that passively track investment indices, about 90% of its holdings. Even after the thermal coal pledge BlackRock owns assets worth $85bn in coal-producing companies. Environmental activists welcomed BlackRock’s decision to consider divesting from the worst climate laggards. However, Gaurav Madan, a senior campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said its actions, including the net zero pledge, were “too little, too late”. “This doesn’t rise to the visionary leadership we need from the world’s largest investor in coal, oil and gas, and deforestation-linked commodities,” he said. BlackRock says it is not its role to force its clients to divest from fossil fuel producers, but it argues that it is making it easier for clients such as pension funds and university endowments to choose environmentally friendly investments rather than support polluters. These included new measures showing “temperature alignment” scores for equity and bond funds, further adding climate risks into its investment processes and launching new funds aligned with the net zero goal."
2021-01-26T10:59:13Z,business,Business,Saga reports surge in holiday interest as Covid vaccine rolls out,"Saga, the travel and insurance company for the over-50s, has reported a rise in holiday interest as the first wave of customers who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 look to “travel in great numbers and live life to the full”. The company said that despite the pandemic, customer retention levels have been high and an average of 69% of cruise guests rebooked rather than asked for a refund. However, the company said more recently this has jumped to 86%, showing the “pent-up demand for cruises among our guests who will benefit from the first round of vaccine rollout”. Under the government’s plans, 15 million people designated to be in the four highest priority vaccination groups, including all those in the UK over the age of 70, will have received at least their first shot by the middle of February. “We are confident in our strategy, the strength of our brand and the loyalty and economic resilience of our customers,” said the Saga chief executive, Euan Sutherland. “We know they are ready to travel in great numbers and live their lives to the full as the vaccine programme is rolled out. Within travel we are focusing on ensuring the safest possible environment for our guests when cruise and holidays resume.” Saga, which last week became the first UK tour operator to tell cruise and holiday customers that they must be fully vaccinated to travel with them this summer, said that as of 23 January it had taken £140m in cruise bookings. It has also issued a further £8m of vouchers to customers who are not ready to rebook a specific cruise. This compares with £127m in bookings taken by the end of January last year, prior to the pandemic. The company plans to restart its tour and cruise operations in May, depending on government travel restrictions at the time.
The company said that it has made significant savings in marketing and administrative costs which means it has reduced its cash burn rate to about £6m a month, from closer to £8m. Despite the increase in holiday bookings Saga has also opened talks with lenders to increase financial flexibility, given the continuing disruption to the travel industry, as well as seeking to defer another £45m in debt repayments relating to its two cruise ships. Saga said it had £51m in cash available at the end of last year and net debt stood at £785m, including what is owed on its ships."
2021-01-26T10:57:24Z,business,Business,UK unemployment reaches four-year high in Covid-19 lockdown,"Unemployment in the UK has reached the highest level for more than four years as the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic and tougher lockdown measures place more pressure on businesses and workers. The Office for National Statistics said the unemployment rate rose to 5% in the three months to the end of November – representing more than 1.7 million people – from 4.9% in the three months to the end of October, reaching the highest level since August 2016. Unemployment was 4% in February before the pandemic struck. In a snapshot of the jobs market during the second English lockdown and as tough restrictions were imposed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to limit the spread of Covid-19, the ONS said redundancies hit a record high during the quarter. Job losses were most heavily concentrated among younger workers, and in the retail and hospitality sectors.
However, weekly figures indicated the number of people being made redundant had started to ease slightly from a peak in September, as the jobs market showed signs of stabilising after worse damage earlier in the pandemic. Separate figures from HMRC for December, which offer an earlier snapshot of the jobs market than the official ONS figures, showed a 52,000 rise in the number of people on company payrolls on the month, but there are still 828,000 fewer workers on payrolls than in February, before the crisis hit. Economists said widespread use of the furlough scheme had helped to prevent a more substantial increase in unemployment. Nye Cominetti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “While the labour market continued to deteriorate, the furlough has held back the tide on jobs losses. Around one in six private sector workers were furloughed during England’s second lockdown in November, and even more are likely to be furloughed today.” The government extended the multibillion-pound wage subsidy scheme at the last-minute with only a matter of hours to spare, despite repeatedly committing to close the programme at the end of October. Amid persistently high Covid infections and tougher restrictions, the number of jobs on furlough has doubled to about 5 million since November from the level in October, while Rishi Sunak has further extended the scheme until the end of April. However, the chancellor is under pressure to provide further support as the unemployment rate continues to rise, including scrapping plans to cut a £20-a-week uplift in universal credit benefits launched last year at the start of the crisis, which is due to be removed in March. Responding to the unemployment figures on Tuesday, Sunak said: “This crisis has gone on far longer than any of us hoped – and every job lost as a result is a tragedy. While the NHS is working hard to protect people with the vaccine we’re throwing everything we’ve got at supporting businesses, individuals and families.” The latest figures from the ONS showed the number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits has shot up to more than 2.6 million, a rise of 113% since March last year, as the pandemic puts people out of work and reduces opportunities for finding a new job. Dave Innes, head of economics at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said the figures showed it was vital for the government to keep the higher rate of universal credit. “Cutting benefits just as unemployment accelerates is bad economics and bad policy. Nor is it acceptable to leave millions of families in the dark about whether their incomes will be cut by £20 a week in April.”
The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s independent economics forecaster, expects unemployment to peak at about 7.5% later this year – representing 2.6 million people – once the furlough scheme is wound down. Union leaders said the government needed to recognise the damage done by withdrawing support too soon, and from leaving its announcements until the last-minute. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said the furlough scheme should extended until the end of 2021 to remove uncertainty facing employers and workers and to help the UK’s economic recovery from Covid-19. “The more people we keep in work, the faster we can recover. But with the job retention scheme set to end in April, millions of people’s jobs hang in the balance,” she said."
2021-01-26T10:03:01Z,business,Business,UK jobs market moves fast as Covid-19 policies launch and unravel,"These are fast-moving times. The latest official unemployment figures tell us what was happening to the UK labour market in the autumn and they already have a historical feel about them. Since the jobless rate hit a four-year high of 5%, restrictions on the economy have been loosened and then reimposed even more stringently. A mass vaccination programme has got under way. Even so, there are four key messages from the unemployment statistics.
The first is that the jobs market is sensitive to the tightening or easing of the lockdown. Last summer, when there was hope for a while that the crisis might be over, the number of job vacancies rose but the recovery in vacancies slowed towards the end of 2020 when the second wave of the pandemic arrived. On a more positive note, the number of employees on payrolls increased by 55,000 in December, the period between the end of the four-week lockdown in England and a new national lockdown being imposed. The second is the importance of the government’s coronavirus job retention scheme, which has kept the rise in unemployment in check. To be sure, the number of people in payrolled employment is 828,000 lower than it was in February last year and the official jobless rate has risen from 3.8% to 5%, but the picture would have been a lot worse without the furlough. In the recessions of the early 1980s and 1990s, the unemployment rate exceeded 10%.
The third message is that the job losses have tended to be concentrated in specific low-wage sectors of the economy, such as hospitality and tourism, and in parts of the country where those sectors account for a high proportion of jobs, such as London. Annual earnings growth has picked up to 3.6% because higher-paid workers have tended to remain in full-time employment while the axe has fallen on people working in pubs, restaurants and bricks-and-mortar retail. The final message is that there is the risk of further job losses unless the exit from the furlough is handled with care. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has announced that wage subsidies will be maintained until the end of April but he is under pressure from the CBI and other employers’ groups to extend it into the summer so that continued support can be provided to vulnerable parts of the economy. In an ideal world this would not be necessary because the vaccines would allow restrictions to be lifted and the employment outlook would brighten as those currently stuck at home spent the savings they have accumulated on eating out and holidays. That, though, was also the hope last summer. Things don’t always go according to plan."
2021-01-26T09:17:21Z,business,Business,Rolls-Royce says new Covid-19 strains will slash travel this year,"Rolls-Royce has slashed its forecast of flying hours and expects to burn through £2bn in cash this year, as uncertainty about the new coronavirus variants and increased travel restrictions put the brakes on a recovery in air travel. The engine-maker said it expects engine flying hours to be about 55% this year compared with pre-Covid levels in 2019. The latest forecast is significantly down on the prediction made by Rolls-Royce, whose business model relies heavily on the number of hours its engines spend in the air, in October of a base case of flying hours this year running at 70% of the 2019 level. Shares fell 9% after the update on Tuesday, making Rolls-Royce the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, as analysts had expected cash burn this year to be lower between £1bn and £1.5bn. “Continued progress on vaccination programmes is encouraging for the medium-term recovery of air traffic and economic activity,“ the company said in a trading update. “In the near-term, however, more contagious variants of the virus are creating additional uncertainty. Enhanced restrictions are delaying the recovery of long-haul travel over the coming months compared to our prior expectations, placing further financial pressure on our customers and the wider aviation industry, all of which are impacting our own cashflows in 2021.” Rolls-Royce, which in October announced a £5bn emergency funding plan to weather the pandemic-fuelled slump in demand for its engines, said the reduction in flying hours means it expects to see an increased free cash outflow of £2bn this year. The company said it expects the cash burn to be steepest in the first half of the year and become cashflow positive as flying hours pick up in the second half. “Significant uncertainty remains over the precise shape and timing of the recovery in air traffic,” the company said. “We continue to expect to turn cashflow positive at some point during the second half, reflecting our forecasted profile of flying hours as they recover from today’s low base.”
The company insisted it had a strong enough balance sheet to weather a delayed recovery in the aviation industry. “With liquidity of approximately £9bn, we are confident that despite the more challenging near-term market conditions we are well positioned for the future,” the company said. Rolls-Royce said it has cut 7,000 of 9,000 jobs, the biggest restructuring in the company’s history, which will save £1.3bn annually upon completion in 2022."
2021-01-26T06:00:55Z,business,Business,Construction material shortages could delay UK housebuilding,"A growing shortage of key construction materials could delay housebuilding this year as builders fight for fresh supplies against a backdrop of coronavirus-related challenges and price increases. One builders’ merchant said they were being given an August delivery date for roofing materials, such as pitched roof tiles, compared with a usual three-month wait because, even with extra shifts, UK factories were struggling to keep up. The industry also continues to be affected by shortages of power tools, screws and fixings, stemming from congestion at UK ports. Companies now face increased shipping costs because of a global shortage of empty containers. Timber prices are also up by a fifth. The Builders Merchants Federation (BMF) said if the problems were not resolved it could “have an impact on the number of houses that we are able to build in the UK” as well as cause delays to smaller projects, such as extensions and loft conversions. “I wouldn’t say it’s having a major impact on contractors and housebuilders yet,” said John Newcomb, the BMF’s chief executive. “But it could do over the next couple of months because clearly you can’t build houses without roof tiles.” Builders’ merchants and DIY stores have enjoyed a sales bonanza over the past year as Britons spent lockdowns renovating their homes. The trend did not even let up at Christmas, with merchants recording growth of more than 10%, a figure Newcomb said was unprecedented. Recent figures from B&Q’s owner, Kingfisher, showed sales up 17%. The implications of the Brexit deal were bubbling away in the background but for builders the major concern was just getting their hands on enough materials to keep working. “Right now, the main issue is that the demand for products like roof tiles is outstripping supply,” Newcomb said. “That will come into balance but a lot of these things are a spillover effect from April, May when factories were closed.” The BMF said there continued to be shortages of plumbing materials and bathroom suites that come from the east Asia because of the problems at major container ports such as Felixstowe, which are struggling to cope with a combination of high container volumes and coronavirus restrictions.
Three-quarters of building materials are made in the UK but Newcomb said the industry needed access to “goods from around the world to keep the industry running”. The cost of shipping goods from China to Europe has also hit record highs in recent weeks, with producers unable to absorb the huge price increases. Lakes Showering, which imports bathroom equipment from China, said the cost of a container load had increased from $2,100 (£1,536) a year ago to $15,750. It was also finding carriers were reluctant to take bookings for the UK because of the congestion problems. “We’ve found the shipping companies are not even quoting contract rates; it’s all based on spot pricing, where you get what’s available at a price, on that day,” said Mike Tattam, the sales and marketing director. “It’s having a very serious impact and it’s a situation that’s getting rapidly worse.”"
2021-01-25T23:25:50Z,business,Business,Janet Yellen confirmed as first female treasury secretary,"Janet Yellen has been confirmed as the first woman to head the US Treasury. The former chair of the Federal Reserve and noted economist was approved by the Senate on an 84-15 vote. She sailed through a congressional hearing last week and had already been unanimously approved by the Senate finance committee and backed by all living former treasury secretaries.
She faces a monumental task. Last week another 900,000 people filed for unemployment benefits – more than the population of San Francisco and four times the number of weekly claims made before the coronavirus pandemic struck. Businesses are closing across the US amid a surge in infections. The US reported more than 188,000 new cases for Thursday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, and close to 4,000 people are dying each day. At the hearing Yellen said it was imperative for the government to “act big” on the next coronavirus relief package and argued now is not the time to worry about the costs of a higher debt burden. Tackling the fallout of Covid-19 would be her top priority, said Yellen, and especially its disproportionately hard impact on communities of color. Black and Latino workers are still experiencing far higher rates of unemployment, at 9.9% and 9.3%, compared with their white counterparts, 6%. “We need to make sure that people aren’t going hungry in America, that they can put food on the table, that they’re not losing their homes and ending up out on the street because of evictions,” Yellen said. “We really need to address those forms of suffering, and I think we shouldn’t compromise on it.”"
2021-01-25T21:02:30Z,business,Business,Online brands are making a clean sweep in the great retail carve-up,"It’s looking like a clean-sweep for the online brigade in the great retail carve-up. Boohoo has bagged Debenhams and Asos is in pole position for the best bits of Arcadia, meaning Topshop, Topman and Miss Selfridge. This outcome, unfortunately, will maximise the number of store closures, and thus job losses, since both buyers will stick rigidly to their online-only formula. It also seemed unlikely even a few weeks ago. JD Sports and Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group were contemplating bids to resuscitate Debenhams, albeit not necessarily in full 124-store form, while Next wanted to own Topshop and keep the shops open. Why couldn’t the old guard win the bidding? In part, it’s because the pure online players are on a roll and eager to slot more brands into their existing infrastructure. Adding recognisable brands represents a relatively low-risk punt. But another feature, perhaps, was the handicap for any store-based bidder of business rates – or, more precisely, uncertainty over the government’s intentions for the property-based tax. Will the Treasury extend the Covid rates holiday for another year, or even for six months? Since Debenhams’ annual rates bill was £75m at the last count, the question will have been relevant for anybody interested in trading the stores. It’s not one, though, that the Treasury has yet answered. And is the government committed to long-term reform of rates, a levy that reflects property values that are seven years old? Ministers hint at reform but never get round to it. In drawing up their bids, JD Sports, Frasers and Next will have had to assume more foot-dragging. Boohoo and Asos might have emerged victorious anyway, of course. Momentum is on their side, which is partly why Debenhams and Arcadia failed in the first place. Asos, for example, has run rings around Sir Philip Green for years in terms of dynamism and investment in Topshop’s core 20-something market. So let’s not overstate the role of business rates in the wider story. But, equally, let’s not ignore it when it comes to today’s situation. Warehouses should pay more in rates and shops should pay less, reflecting up-to-date property values. Maybe, under a such a set-up, Debenhams and Arcadia could have survived longer in physical form under JD Sports or Next. We’ll never know. But several thousand people – those now likely to lose their store-based jobs – are entitled to wonder. UK Covid respiratory treatment trials funded by US government Congratulations to Synairgen. This Aim-listed company, a spin-out from Southampton University, has secured government funding for expanded clinical trials on a potential respiratory treatment for Covid patients not yet requiring hospitalisation. The surprise is over the identity of the government. It’s the US healthcare agencies that are interested in the possible new application of a drug that is used already for multiple sclerosis patients. The partnership is under the US “Operation Warp Speed” programme. Synairgen’s shares, which had had a good run already, rose 10%. Synairgen says it regularly updates the department of health in the UK on progress, which is why it’s odd the US seems keener to back more research. Maybe the department has its reasons but, if so, it’s not sharing them. Covid treatments are needed in addition to vaccines, the medical community says. It would be embarrassing if this homegrown treatment succeeds because of US public money."
2021-01-25T20:52:40Z,business,Business,"Debenhams deal and Topshop talks put more than 20,000 jobs at risk","More than 20,000 high street jobs are at risk after the online retailer Boohoo bought the Debenhams brand and its rival Asos said it was poised to buy Topshop. Debenhams, which traces its roots back to 1778, will disappear from the high street with the likely loss of up to 12,000 jobs after the £55m Boohoo deal, which does not include the department store chain’s high street operation. As part of the deal, Boohoo will buy the retailer’s Maine, Mantaray, Principles and Faith labels, while Debenhams’ remaining 124 stores will be permanently closed once they are allowed to reopen in order to sell off stock.
The online fashion retailer Asos is, meanwhile, in exclusive talks to buy Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and the athleisure label HIIT from Arcadia, Sir Phillip Green’s former retail empire, which collapsed into administration last year and employs 13,000 people. If Asos finalises a deal for Arcadia’s leading brands it is likely to be bad news for thousands of staff at the relevant stores, which are not expected to be taken on by the online specialist. Arcadia Group – which also owns Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton – had 500 stores across the UK when it entered administration in November. So far only the group’s plus-size retail chain, Evans, has been sold off. After the £23m deal with the Australian retailer City Chic Collective, all Evans shops and concessions will shut as the brand becomes an online-only business. While Arcadia and Debenhams have been struggling for some time, the two deals highlight the disparate fortunes of the online specialists and their ageing rivals reliant on physical stores, which have been forced to close for months during the coronavirus pandemic. Richard Hyman, a retail analyst and partner at the consultancy TPC, said Covid-19 had only accelerated an existing trend: “Twenty years ago there was no such thing as online retailing. Non-food retail sales online hit £90bn in 2020. [Since 2000] the number of physical stores have not gone down and something has got to give. “It is terrible for the people that work there but there is going to have to be a lot of repurposing as UK retail is oversupplied.” According to the Centre for Retail Research, the UK high street shed 177,000 jobs in 2020, and a further 200,000 are expected to be lost this year. The retail trade union Usdaw is seeking urgent meetings with Debenhams’ administrators and called on the government to do more to save high streets. Dave Gill, Usdaw’s national officer, said: “It is devastating news for our high streets that Debenhams’ administrators have sold the company brand to an online-only retailer. Throughout Debenhams’ difficulties, the company and then administrators have refused to engage with Usdaw; the staff are being treated appallingly.” The union wants the government to extend business rates relief and help with millions of pounds of rents that have gone unpaid during the government’s high street lockdowns. Boohoo plans to use Debenhams to help attract more mature shoppers and expand into new product categories beyond fashion. It also wants to begin selling brands it does not own for the first time from late spring, turning Debenhams into a marketplace, similar to Amazon or Zalando, with third-party labels handling distribution of their products sold on the site. Debenhams made approximately £400m in online revenues in the financial year to 31 August 2020 and welcomed 300 million visitors, making it a top 10 retail website in the UK. “This is a transformational deal for the group, which allows us to capture the fantastic opportunity as e-commerce continues to grow. Our ambition is to create the UK’s largest marketplace,” said Mahmud Kamani, the executive chairman at Boohoo. “Our acquisition of the Debenhams brand is strategically significant as it represents a huge step which accelerates our ambition to be a leader, not just in fashion e-commerce but in new categories including beauty, sport and homeware.” The company said that after the Debenhams deal it had £387m in cash to fund further potential acquisitions. The deal with Boohoo marks a final rebuff for Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, the owner of Sports Direct, which had been in talks to buy Debenhams for some weeks after failing to gain control of the department store before its first fall into administration in 2019. Ashley is expected to try to take on a number of Debenhams stores from landlords to house his Flannels, Sports Direct and House of Fraser chains.
Shares in Asos rose almost 6% after it said it was in talks to buy the Arcadia brands. The company said a deal would be funded from cash reserves and “represent a compelling opportunity to acquire strong brands that resonate well with its customer base”. However, it said there could be “no certainty of a transaction and Asos will keep shareholders updated as appropriate”. Chloe Collins, a senior analyst at the consultancy GlobalData, said: “The [Arcadia] brands are already popular sellers through its third-party platform, proving that there is strong customer overlap, and Asos’s impressive global reach would help the Arcadia brands target new shoppers.”"
2021-01-25T20:05:27Z,business,Business,Boohoo buying Debenhams: a changing of the guard in retail,"The symbolism is stark: a venerable 243-year-old department store chain acquired by a 15-year-old online upstart. Debenhams will disappear from British high streets after its sale to Boohoo, swallowed by a company that thrives in the world of fast fashion and has become mired in controversy in the process. Boohoo has drawn criticism for poor working conditions in its supply chain but continues to make strong sales growth as it feeds a voracious consumer appetite for affordable fashion that responds quickly to shifts in taste and style.
The £55m deal also marks a changing of the guard in UK retail prompted by a radical acceleration towards buying clothes, beauty products and homewares online during the pandemic. First launched in 2006, Manchester-based Boohoo has grown from a three-employee operation to a business with sales of more than £1.2bn last year and a 5,000-strong workforce. Sales jumped 40% in the run-up to Christmas as shoppers shrugged off revelations about treatment of workers in factories making Boohoo’s clothing in the UK and overseas. An investigation by the Guardian found that factories in Leicester making the company’s clothes were failing to pay workers the minimum wage and were putting the health of staff at risk during lockdown. Sir Brian Leveson, who led the phone-hacking inquiry, was drafted in to lead change at Boohoo after a damning independent review, which found that media reports of poor conditions in the company’s supply chain were “substantially true”. The Boohoo co-founder Mahmud Kamani said this month that he was proud of the speed at which his team had reacted to the supply chain scandal. But Leveson said a clean-up of the retailer’s supply chain had a “long way to go”. The issues at factories are not the only reason Boohoo has drawn criticism. Shortly after unveiling the record profits last year, Boohoo announced a controversial scheme under which its bosses could receive a £150m bonus if the company’s shares rose by two-thirds over three years. Its co-founders Carol Kane and Kamani would receive two-thirds of the payout.
In May last year, Boohoo raised £200m to buy up brands and has already taken advantage of rivals’ difficulties to snap up Oasis, Warehouse, Karen Millen and Coast. It also consolidated its stake in Pretty Little Thing, giving Mahmud’s son Umar Kamani and his business partner, Paul Papworth, more than £260m for their 35% stake. The Debenhams deal is the latest in this consolidation campaign. The long-troubled department store chain has been on the radar of would-be buyers for some time. It began looking for a rescue bidder last summer after calling in administrators twice in a year. Founded in 1778, Debenhams is one of the world’s oldest department stores but has been brought down after being loaded with debt by a force in modern finance: private equity. First listed on the London Stock Exchange in the 1920s, at one time the group had more than 200 large stores across 18 countries and partnerships with some of the world’s best-known designers, including Jasper Conran and Julien Macdonald. But in recent years sales have stagnated as it struggled to cope with heavy debts built up under private equity ownership. In 2003 the group was taken over by a private equity consortium. The trio of funds, TPG, CVC Capital and Merrill Lynch, collected £1.2bn in dividends in less than three years. In 2005, 23 shops were sold for £495m, as part of an effort to pay down debts linked to the buyout. Debenhams leased the stores back, on expensive rent deals up to 35 years in length. As it struggled with those long leases and heavy debts, Debenhams lacked resources to improve the appeal of its ageing stores and was slow to shift towards selling online.
While some of its in-house brands remain quite large, growth has stalled as they have not been updated sufficiently and some rely on designer names that were considered old hat a decade ago. Despite that, Debenhams’ online business takes £400m a year from 300 million visitors, making it one of the top retail websites in the UK. Analysts say the acquisition of Debenhams’ website will take Boohoo to a new level, helping it appeal to older shoppers and giving access to new markets including beauty, homewares and sportswear. Boohoo hopes to use its existing systems to take Debenhams brands such as Principles, Maine and Mantaray overseas, and improve their distribution in the UK. The company also wants to set itself up as a marketplace – similar to Amazon or Zalando – selling third-party brands for the first time using Debenhams’ existing relationships. Andrew Wade, an analyst at the stockbroker firm Jefferies, said Boohoo had “bought a lot of asset for £55m” if Debenhams’ relationships with brands were added to its expertise in beauty, homewares and sportswear. But the permanent closure of Debenhams’ remaining 124 stores will leave enormous gaps on high streets around the country and the loss of thousands of steady jobs, the majority of which were held by women. Meanwhile, Boohoo has plenty of money to pull off similar deals and says it has £387m of cash left to fund further acquisitions. The impact of coronavirus on the high street will produce many more targets."
2021-01-25T17:41:50Z,business,Business,"National Grid should lose role as electricity system operator, says Ofgem","National Grid could lose its role of keeping Britain’s lights on after the energy regulator called for a new and independent electricity system operator to help steer the UK towards its climate targets. Ofgem has called for National Grid to be stripped of its role after 30 years balancing the electricity grid because the energy company also owns energy networks. The regulator warned this could create a conflict of interest in the future as the UK’s networks play a larger role in helping to keep the lights on. National Grid has already legally separated the electricity system operator business from the FTSE 100 group but Ofgem’s proposal would lead to all ties being severed and a new independent system operator put in its place. Jonathan Brearley, the chief executive of Ofgem, said: “The energy system needs to go undergo the biggest transformation in over a century to meet Britain’s ambitious climate goals.” “Imagine you have 10m electric cars on the system, and lots of renewable energy. You could manage this in two ways. One way is to build a much bigger and higher capacity network. Equally you could have a smarter and more efficient system that begins to shift the times that those different cars charge, which could be a lot cheaper overall for customers. Asking a company which builds networks to make that kind of trade-off is the sort of thing we’re concerned about in the future,” he said. “Ofgem is recommending the creation of an independent body to help deliver the fundamental changes in how we use energy,” Brearley said. The new operator could provide independent recommendations to the government and Ofgem on gas and electricity network investment proposals to help move the UK towards a net zero carbon electricity grid at the lowest possible cost, according to the regulator. This could help to save consumers between £400m and £4.8bn between 2022 and 2050. An independent operator could also take on wider planning responsibilities for new infrastructure, for example the design and construction of an offshore grid connecting offshore windfarms to the UK, Ofgem added. Alistair Cromwell, the acting chief executive of Citizens Advice, said a separate body to run the electricity and gas systems “should give consumers more confidence that the advice given, and decisions taken, will be in their interests”. “This should lead to lower bills and an efficient transition to net zero. But the new independent system operator - as advocated by Ofgem - needs to have the right structure, responsibilities and capabilities to enable it to make the best decisions for all of us,” Cromwell said. The structure and ownership of an independent system operator would be decided by the government in consultation with National Grid. The FTSE 100 energy company would be entitled to some financial compensation if it is stripped of the business, which is considered a very small part of the group. Equity analysts at Barclays have estimated the value of the National Grid electricity system operator at £300m, or less than 1% of the group’s market value. Ofgem believes the cost of compensating National Grid for the business would be outweighed by the long-term financial benefit to energy bill payers.
Kwasi Kwarteng, the business and energy secretary, said the government welcomed Ofgem’s contribution to the debate over the future of the energy system and would “consider its recommendations thoroughly”. National Grid said in a statement that it was working closely with the government, regulator and the industry to explore the future of the energy system operator, and added that a “potential divestment” of its role was “an important part of that discussion”. “Significant further work is needed to determine the detail of that structure,” the company said."
2021-01-25T16:35:08Z,business,Business,Edinburgh's landmark department store Jenners to close after 183 years,"Edinburgh’s Jenners department store is closing its landmark site on Princes Street after 183 years with the loss of 200 jobs. Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, which operates Jenners as part of its House of Fraser department store chain, said the store would close on 3 May after it had been unable to reach an agreement with the site’s owner on the extension of a tenancy deal.
The Danish fashion billionaire and major Scottish landowner Anders Holch Povlsen, who bought the Jenners building for a reported £50m in 2017, is set to restore and renovate it under plans to turn more than half of the site into a hotel. The owner said in 2019 that a department store was “a vital future part of the project”, which includes restoring the building’s Victorian facade and three-storey central atrium, as well as adding cafes and restaurants. On Tuesday, a spokesman for AAA United, the Povlsen-backed company that owns the Jenners site, said Frasers had decided to quit the building despite being offered rent-free periods during all the high street lockdowns as well as rent deferrals and payment plans. It said it was in talks with other retailers about operating a department store there, although the store would not be able to trade as Jenners because House of Fraser owns the trading rights. Anders Krogh Vogdrup, director of AAA United, said that plans to redevelop the building were currently “on hold due to the current economic climate”. He added: “Jenners is a much-loved Edinburgh institution. It is our aspiration to recapture its former glory; and that this building will continue to be home to the city’s anchor department store.” Department stores have come under serious pressure, with Debenhams about to permanently shut all its 124 remaining outlets, Beales closing all its stores after falling into administration, and John Lewis closing eight stores last year.
Sports Direct bought House of Fraser out of administration in August 2018. Since then, at least 14 of the group’s original 59 stores have closed, including Frasers on Princes Street in Edinburgh and stores in Exeter, Shrewsbury and Cirencester. A spokesperson for Frasers, which owns Sports Direct, Evans Cycles, Jack Wills and Flannels as well as House of Fraser, said regarding Jenners: “Despite the global pandemic, numerous lockdowns and the turbulence caused for British retail, the landlord hasn’t been able to work mutually on a fair agreement, therefore, resulting in the loss of 200 jobs and a vacant site for the foreseeable future with no immediate plans. “Our commitment to our Frasers strategy remains but landlords and retailers need to work together in a fair manner, especially when all stores are closed.”"
2021-01-25T16:30:03Z,business,Business,Australia's recession is weird and wacky but no longer our worst | Greg Jericho,"Employment at the end of last year was more promising than anyone expected when the virus first hit. Australia’s isolation from the rest of the world, which is often an economic negative, has in this case been a positive, as we have been much better able to quarantine ourselves from the pandemic. But while things are improved, we remain in a recession – even if it is a very odd one. And the latest retail figures for December show that we clearly remain in an abnormal situation. In December the unemployment rate of 6.6% was nicely below the 7.5% peak reached in July last year. Even better, the underemployment rate had fallen from 13.8% in April to 8.5%.
That made for an underutilisation rate of 15.1%, which is the worst we have had since 1997, but at least is below the worst that was experienced during the 1990s recession. Given the large increase in unemployment and underemployment over the past year, however, the labour market remains in recession.
US economist Claudia Sahm’s measure of recession, which compares the rate of unemployment with the lowest point of the past 12 months, shows that conditions remain as bad as they were at the peak of the GFC:
My own version of the measure, which looks at underemployment, suggests things are not as bad as they were at the peak of the GFC, but are still well in recession territory:
But what a weird recession! The latest preliminary retail trade figures estimate that in December total retail trade was 9.4% above where it was a year before. That is rather absurd – three times the median growth of retail trade over the past 15 years. The monthly growth is even more silly – down 4.2% coming off the back of 7.1% growth in November. Normally retail trade goes up around 0.4%. There are a few ways to work out when this pandemic era is over and our economy is back to normal, but one of the best might be to look at our spending patterns:
Right now things are wacky, both up and down every month. When retail trade gets back to growing around 0.4% a month we can begin to think things are back where they usually are (regardless of whether that might be good or bad). The retail figures, which were likely affected to a small extent by the northern beaches Sydney outbreak, also reveal just how big November has become as a shopping month. Thanksgiving might have no meaning in Australia, but we sure as heck enjoy the “black Friday” sales that follow. The other aspect is that despite the pandemic and the recession, we are spending much more on retail than would ever have been expected a year ago. Even with the large fall in spending in December we spent $30.3bn in the shops – around 6% more than would have been expected going by the past five years:
Clearly the inability to spend on travel – especially overseas – has left households with a desire to spend elsewhere. The big beneficiary of this has been household goods stores. This category includes furniture, electrical and electronic goods, and hardware. And boy, have we spent money in those stores. Even with a 9% fall in December, we spent 15% more on such items than expected by the five-year trend:
All up we have spent over $8bn more on household goods since March than would have been expected. One of the important aspects of retail trade is that it makes up a significant portion of all household spending (or “consumption”). It doesn’t include power bills etc, but there is a fairly good relationship between retail spending and household consumption – and this latter measure is what appears in the GDP figures:
Even last year amid the pandemic, this relationship remained relatively close and the big surge of retail and household consumption spending in September completely drove all the GDP growth in that quarter:
But the slower growth of retail in the December quarter suggests we should not see anything like the big September GDP growth of 3.3%, although it will likely still feature a lot of abnormalities. And so, while retail spending in December was strong, it does not reflect anything like normal economic conditions. Households are shifting their spending from holidays and vacations to home renovations and improvements. Overall, spending remains well above what we would expect, and at this point the big question is whether the introduction of the vaccine and lowering of travel restrictions will see a return to previous spending habits, or if this is the new normal."
2021-01-25T16:09:24Z,business,Business,Cineworld bosses' bonus scheme worth up to £208m gets green light,"Investors in Britain’s largest cinema chain have approved a controversial incentive scheme that could result in bosses being awarded more than £200m in shares, while acknowledging that 30% of shareholders who voted rejected the plan. Cineworld, which closed all of its 127 sites in the UK and Ireland indefinitely in October, held a vote on a new pay policy and long-term incentive plan at a special meeting. The cinema owner had been expecting a significant shareholder revolt after ISS and Glass Lewis, two influential investor advisory services, recommended rejecting the policies, branding them as unjustifiably excessive. Investors accounting for 67% of Cineworld’s total shares voted. Of those, 30% voted to reject the policies. “We are pleased that the plan has been supported by a wide range of our shareholders,” said Alicja Kornasiewicz, the chair of Cineworld. “We acknowledge that there were a significant number of votes cast against the plan, and the board will continue to engage with shareholders on remuneration matters in the coming months in light of the feedback received during our consultation.” The schemes, which required 50% voter approval to be implemented, were never in any real doubt of being passed as the Greidinger family control 20% of Cineworld. If the scheme hits its top target then the chief executive, Mooky Greidinger, and his brother and deputy, Israel, will receive awards worth £33m each.
The proposed long-term incentive plan will reward the company’s senior executive team if Cineworld’s share price bounces back to 190p within three years. If this level – which is close to its pre-pandemic level of 197p – is reached, bosses will share £104m. If the share price reaches the upper cap of 380p, executive directors would between them be awarded shares worth a total of £208m. Shares were trading at 64p on Monday. Cineworld’s 5,500 UK staff have been out of work and furloughed since October, when the company closed all its sites indefinitely after the announcement that the release of the next James Bond film would be delayed. There has been a significant round of voluntary and compulsory redundancies since then. In November, Cineworld secured financial lifelines from lenders worth $750m (£560m) to weather the coronavirus pandemic until May. On Monday, the Odeon owner, AMC, the world’s largest cinema chain, announced it had raised more than $900m, which its chief executive said “put any talk of an imminent bankruptcy off the table”."

2021-01-25T14:15:10Z,business,Business,The dried flower craze: how a summer of cancelled weddings led to a big new trend,"Name: Dried flowers. Age: Old. How old? Very. Brightly coloured flowers were found in Egyptian tombs, so about 4,000 years old. Ornamental nosegays became popular in the 16th century. Can any flowers be dried? Some lend themselves to the process better than others. Hydrangeas, salvia and xeranthemum are all good. Don’t they just wilt and wither? Not if you do it right. Flowers can be simply hung in a ventilated area, dried with hot air in a special drying chamber, or dried using silica gel. In 1813, the process of freeze-drying was introduced to the Royal Society in London by a chap named William Hyde Wollaston. Yeah, fascinating. But why are we talking about it now? Valentine’s Day? Because it’s hot. Freeze-drying? NO! The whole process, as well as the dried flowers themselves. They’re very in. What, those dusty old things you might find on the mantelpiece in a B&B in Bexhill-on-Sea? Time to rethink that, and them. Why? Because sales of dried flowers have, well, bloomed in the UK during the pandemic. Bloomin’ heck. Stop it. But yes, up 115%. Any reason? Bex Partridge – a florist and the author of Everlastings: How to Grow, Harvest and Create With Dried Flowers – says that many British flower farmers, faced with Covid-cancelled weddings, suddenly had to figure out what to do with their blooms. So they dried them? Exactly. And has the fresh flower industry dried up? No. Unsurprisingly, the global floral industry, which relies on global supply chains and fully open borders, has been hit hard. But the fact that supermarkets have remained open has been a lifeline. Presumably Brexit is not going to help in the UK? Fresh flowers aren’t generally improved by spending time in warehouses and lorry parks. The former Tory minister John Redwood says we need to take back control of our flower production, obviously. Along with cheese and veg and all the rest of it. Yay, English roses all round. Also daffodils, shamrocks and thistles (until they rejoin). Or dried flowers. Exactly. “It’s not either or,” says Partridge. “It’s just another way to use flowers.” Try to think beyond the dust and the chintz. And you don’t have to spend loads of money: get out there, find some interesting seed heads, teasels, old bracken, whatever, and mix them with some fresh flowers.
Are you telling me this is going to be my new lockdown interiors thing? Well, you’ve got a kneely chair, and the bed desk, and painted the kitchen sage green because you read that was the thing to do; dried flowers is the next logical place to go. Do say: “Loving the delicate poppy heads against the wispiness of the grasses, and the bold purple statice, my early Valentine …” Don’t say: “I’ve got a dust allergy, in the bin with those, Grandma.”"
2021-01-25T13:59:12Z,business,Business,Shell agrees deal to buy electric car-charging company ubitricity,"Shell has agreed to buy one of Europe’s largest on-street electric car-charging companies to accelerate its move into low-carbon transport. The oil company, which faces growing pressure to cut its carbon emissions, expects the deal to buy the German car-charger ubitricity to be finalised by the end of the year.
The car-charging network includes more than 2,700 charge points across the UK, or 13% of the existing market share, and more than 1,500 charge points across Germany and France. István Kapitány, the head of Shell’s global mobility business, said ubitricity’s work with local authorities to fit car chargers to existing street infrastructure such as lamp-posts and bollards would help make owning an electric vehicle more convenient. “On-street options such as the lamp-post charging offered by ubitricity will be key for those who live and work in cities or have limited access to off-street parking,” he said. “Whether at home, at work or on the go, we want to provide our customers with accessible and affordable EV [electric vehicle] charging options so they can charge up no matter where they are.” The deal is set to accelerate the race to corner the market in electric vehicle charging, which is gaining pace among energy companies because of the UK’s plan to ban the sale of new fossil fuel vehicles by 2030. Shell was one of the first energy companies to set out plans for “green” forecourts in the UK, which offer electric charging, hydrogen cell refuelling and biofuels rather than petrol and diesel. It also installed the UK’s first 150kW electric vehicle charger, in the summer of 2019, which can charge a car in half an hour. However, on-street charging is considered crucial to the success of electric vehicles because the option is likely to be more convenient for drivers, particularly in cities.
Late last year BP consolidated its car-charge network acquisitions – including a £130m deal to buy Chargemaster – to create what it claims to be the UK’s largest public car-charging network, made up of 7,000 charge points. Lex Hartman, ubitricity’s chief executive, said his charging network stands out because the charge points are integrated into existing on-street infrastructure. “Particularly in larger cities where there is limited access to off-street parking, this is the solution many people have been waiting for to allow them to transition to EV ownership. Combining this piece of the puzzle with Shell’s existing range of EV charging solutions gives EV drivers access to a full range of charging options, making Shell and ubitricity a perfect match,” Hartman added."
2021-01-25T13:09:40Z,business,Business,"Covid-19 has cost global workers $3.7tn in lost earnings, says ILO","The economic blow from Covid-19 has cost workers around the world $3.7tn (£2.7tn) in lost earnings, after the pandemic wiped out four times the number of working hours lost in the 2008 financial crisis, according to the UN’s labour body. The International Labour Organization (ILO) said women and younger workers had borne the brunt of job losses and reductions in hours, and warned that people in sectors hardest hit by the crisis – such as hospitality and retail – risked being left behind when the economy recovered.
Sounding the alarm that entrenched levels of inequality risked becoming a defining feature of the economic rebound from Covid-19, the Geneva-based agency said that governments around the world needed to take urgent action to support those at the heart of the storm. In its annual analysis of the global jobs market, it said 8.8% of working hours were lost in 2020 relative to the end of 2019, equivalent to 255m full-time jobs. This is approximately four times bigger than the toll on workers as a consequence of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. These “massive losses” resulted in an 8.3% decline in global labour income, before government support measures are included, according to the ILO, equivalent to $3.7tn in earnings – about 4.4% of global GDP. Women have been more affected than men by the disruption to the jobs market, with female workers more likely to drop out of work altogether and stop looking for a new job. Younger workers have also been particularly hard hit, either losing jobs, dropping out of the labour force or delaying the search for a first job.
The ILO said there were some encouraging signs of recovery at the start of 2021, with the Covid-19 vaccine gradually being deployed around the world. However, it still estimated the continuing economic fallout would lead to a 3% loss of working hours globally in 2021 compared with the end of 2019, equivalent to 90m full-time jobs. In a pessimistic scenario, which assumes slow progress on vaccination, working hours would fall by 4.6% this year, while on an optimistic path the world economy would still lose 1.3% of working hours. It said the outcome would depend on how well the pandemic was brought under control, and by how much consumer and business confidence recovered. Guy Ryder, the director general of the ILO, said: “We are at a fork in the road. One path leads to an uneven, unsustainable, recovery with growing inequality and instability, and the prospect of more crises. The other focuses on a human-centred recovery for building back better, prioritising employment, income and social protection, workers’ rights and social dialogue. If we want a lasting, sustainable and inclusive recovery, this is the path policymakers must commit to.”"
2021-01-25T11:03:36Z,business,Business,"Asos in talks to buy Topshop, Topman and Miss Selfridge","The online fashion retailer Asos is in exclusive talks to buy a number of the UK’s best-known high street brands including Topshop, Topman and Miss Selfridge. The brands are part of Sir Philip Green’s fashion empire Arcadia, which collapsed into administration last year. If Asos can seal a deal it is likely to be bad news for thousands of staff and the high street store network as it operates as an online-only business. Arcadia Group as a whole employed 13,000 staff and had 500 stores across the UK when it entered administration in November.
“Asos notes recent media speculation and confirms that it is in exclusive discussions with the administrators of Arcadia over the acquisition of the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands,” the company confirmed in a statement to the stock market. “The board believes this would represent a compelling opportunity to acquire strong brands that resonate well with its customer base. However, at this stage, there can be no certainty of a transaction and Asos will keep shareholders updated as appropriate. Any acquisition would be funded from cash reserves.” Asos shares rose 6% after the announcement on Monday. The Guardian first revealed on Friday that Asos had emerged as a serious contender to buy the Topshop brand. Other bidders pursuing Topshop include Shein, a Chinese online fashion retailer; Authentic Brands, the US owner of the Barneys department store, which has been linked to a joint bid with JD Sports; and the billionaire Issa brothers, who in October announced they were buying Asda for £6.8bn. “Asos would by far be the most complementary new owner for Topshop, Topman and Miss Selfridge,” said Chloe Collins, a senior analyst at GlobalData. “The brands are already popular sellers through its third-party platform, proving that there is strong customer overlap, and Asos’s impressive global reach would help the Arcadia brands target new shoppers. The retailer’s digital prowess will aid the brands in gaining top-of-mind appeal, as they have so far fell behind online competition.”
Administrators have been seeking buyers for Arcadia’s brands, which also include Dorothy Perkins and Burton. Evans, its plus-size clothing brand, was sold to City Chic Collective, an Australian retailer, for £23m. Arcadia’s high street rival Next, which was working with the US hedge fund Davidson Kempner, pulled out of the auction on Thursday. In a statement, the consortium said it had been “unable to meet the price expectations of the vendor” amid speculation that Topshop, Arcadia’s prime asset, could fetch between £250m and £300m. On Monday, the online fast fashion retailer Boohoo announced a deal to buy the Debenhams brand but it does not include the 118 high street stores or the 12,000 staff."
2021-01-25T10:51:08Z,business,Business,"Debenhams to close all stores with 12,000 jobs at risk as Boohoo buys brand","The online retailer Boohoo has acquired Debenhams in a £55m deal that will result in the department store disappearing from the high street with the likely loss of up to 12,000 jobs. Boohoo, which is also buying the brands Maine, Mantaray, Principles and Faith, said Debenhams’ remaining stores will be wound down after the high street lockdown ends and they can reopen to sell off stock. The 243-year-old Debenhams chain is already in the process of closing down after administrators failed to secure a rescue deal for the business and its remaining 124 stores last year. The company had already announced that six of those shops would not reopen after lockdown, including its flagship department store on London’s Oxford Street.
“The group will only be acquiring the brands and associated intellectual property rights,” Boohoo said. “The transaction does not include Debenhams’ retail stores, stock or any financial services.” Debenhams made approximately £400m in online revenues in its most recent financial year to 31 August 2020. Boohoo said the Debenhams website receives 300m visits a year, making it a top 10 retail website in the UK by traffic. “This is a transformational deal for the group, which allows us to capture the fantastic opportunity as e-commerce continues to grow. Our ambition is to create the UK’s largest marketplace,” said Mahmud Kamani, the executive chairman at Boohoo. “Our acquisition of the Debenhams brand is strategically significant as it represents a huge step which accelerates our ambition to be a leader, not just in fashion e-commerce but in new categories including beauty, sport and homeware.” The retail trade union Usdaw said it was seeking urgent meetings with Debenhams’ administrators and called on the government to do more to save high streets. Dave Gill, Usdaw’s national officer, said: “It is devastating news for our high streets that Debenhams’ administrators have sold the company brand to an online-only retailer. Throughout Debenhams’ difficulties the company and then administrators have refused to engage with Usdaw; the staff are being treated appallingly.” The union wants the government to extend business rates relief and help with millions of pounds of rents that have gone unpaid as shops have been forced to close during the coronavirus pandemic. John Lyttle, the Boohoo chief executive, said the company was still “working through the numbers” on how many jobs might be saved but that there were “no definitive numbers at this point”. Some jobs in beauty are expected to be saved. He said Debenhams will operate as a digital “shop window” for Boohoo’s brands, including Pretty Little Thing and Nasty Gal, as well as third-party brands. Boohoo will take a commission on third-party sales, but not responsibility for delivery or customer service, in a similar way to online marketplaces such as Amazon or Zalando. “Initially, we want to get the [Debenhams] marketplace launched in the spring to early summer,” Lyttle said in a call with analysts. “Across the group, just under half of our revenues are made internationally, so there is an opportunity to launch the marketplace in international markets over time.” He also added that strong Debenhams brands, such as Principles, Maine and Faith, could get their own standalone retail websites as well as being sold within the marketplace. Lyttle said that post-acquisition Boohoo would still have more than £380m in cash to fund further acquisitions. Boohoo has already taken advantage of the damage the pandemic has wrought on traditional retailers by buying the Oasis, Coast and Karen Millen brands out of administration, but not their high street stores. Susannah Streeter, the senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the acquisition marked a significant moment for Boohoo and for retail. “Boohoo aims to break into the retail big time with this deal. It marks quite a journey for the company, which started as a fast fashion upstart and is now turning into a sprawling empire, by scooping up household names which have fallen into distress,” she said. “Showing just how far the once mighty have fallen, Boohoo has only had to dip a little into its deep cash pockets to snap up the department store chain’s most precious assets.” Shares in Boohoo rose 4% after the detail was announced on Monday. Debenhams had been trying to find a buyer since the summer but its administrators – which have been running the business since April – said they had not received “a deliverable proposal”. The deal with Boohoo marks a final rebuff for Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, the owner of Sports Direct, which had been in talks to buy Debenhams for some weeks after failing to gain control of the department store before its first fall into administration in 2019. Ashley is expected to try to take on a number of Debenhams stores from landlords to house his Flannels, Sports Direct and House of Fraser chains.
Debenhams traces its roots back to 1778, when William Clark established a drapers store on Wigmore Street in the West End of London. Its current name stems from 1813 when William Debenham invested in the company, which became Clark & Debenham. Last year, Debenhams entered rescue talks with JD Sports but the sports retailer pulled out when Arcadia, the parent company of brands including Topman, entered administration. Arcadia operated more concessions in Debenhams than any other retailer and Arcadia is believed to have sold about £100m of clothing a year via Debenhams’ shop floors. On Monday, the online retailer Asos confirmed that it is in exclusive talks to buy a number of Arcadia’s brands."
2021-01-25T05:59:06Z,business,Business,Covid leaves Boris Johnson with an expensive 'levelling down' problem,"The economic impact of Covid will leave Boris Johnson’s government with a costly “double challenge” to level-up the north and Midlands while protecting the affluent towns and cities in southern England suffering most job losses, according to a report. Warning that the prime minister’s election promise to rebalance Britain’s lopsided economy had been made four times harder by the pandemic, the Centre for Cities said a dual approach to the post-Covid recovery was required. In its annual study of the UK’s major urban areas, the independent thinktank said Covid had created a new challenge in the south and added significantly to the scale of the existing challenges in the north and Midlands. London and the south-east has been disproportionately hit by job losses during the crisis, according to the research, which warned ministers that rapid action would be needed to avoid “levelling down” these places. At the same time, places across the north and Midlands need support to recover from Covid-19 and also to go further to match pre-pandemic levels in the south. Birmingham, Hull and Blackpool face the biggest levelling-up challenges, according to the report. However, London, Crawley and Slough are among the prosperous places of concern following their reliance on businesses hit hardest by lockdowns and physical-distancing restrictions. Unemployment has increased by more than 114% since the pandemic struck, with more than 2.6 million people across the UK now claiming unemployment-related benefits. Before the crisis, 36 cities and large towns – 25 of which are located in the north and Midlands – had an above-average claimant count rate, in a reflection of the economic challenges facing places at the heart of the levelling-up agenda. Bringing them in line with the national average would have meant almost 170,000 fewer people claiming unemployment-related benefits. According to the report, this has now increased to 634,000 – meaning the task of levelling-up has become four times harder. In response to the pandemic, the Centre for Cities said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, needed to make permanent the £20 per week increase in the value of universal credit launched at the start of the crisis. Despite intense opposition, the government plans to cut universal credit at the end of March. It also said support for the hospitality sector – potentially through a renewed Eat out to help out scheme once the health situation is safe – was also required.
However, the thinktank warned that acting to prevent further economic damage by Covid-19 was not the same as levelling up. Once the health crisis ended, it said ministers would need to spend extra money on further measures to level up, including on education and transport infrastructure. Andrew Carter, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities, said: “Covid-19 has made the government’s pledge to level up the north and Midlands much harder. It was promised on the assumption that places in the south would remain prosperous. Covid-19 has shaken this assumption, with cities ranging from London to Crawley now struggling. “Levelling up the north and Midlands and stopping the south’s levelling down will not be cheap and will require more than short-term handouts. Government support and investment for new businesses in emerging industries will be essential, as will spending on further education to train people to do the good-quality jobs created.”"
2021-01-25T00:01:40Z,business,Business,Boohoo 'set to buy' Debenhams' online business for £50m,"Internet fashion retailer Boohoo has reportedly agreed to buy the online business of Debenhams, in a move which will see the department store chain close its remaining high street shops, according to sources close to the deal. The transaction may be announced this week, according to the Financial Times. The newspaper said it understands the purchase price is likely to be around £50m. The department store chain, which traces its roots back 243 years, entered administration in April 2019.
It had been trying to find a buyer since last summer, but its administrators said they had not received “a deliverable proposal” at the time of its liquidation in December. As of that month, it had 124 UK stores. Debenhams’ finances, which had been shaky prior to the pandemic – owing to the shift away from the high street in favour of online shopping – were badly hit by retail closures imposed by the government to curb the spread of the virus in the spring. The liquidation at the start of December came after the JD Sports chain walked away from rescue talks. The sports retailer pulled out of the talks when Arcadia went under. Sir Philip Green’s fashion empire operated more concessions in Debenhams than any other retailer and is believed to have sold about £100m of clothing a year via Debenhams shopfloors.
The fate of the two retailers is believed to have been closely interlinked, with one supplier saying in December: “Losing Arcadia was a fatal blow to Debenhams and losing Debenhams was a fatal blow to Arcadia.” Online giant Asos is understood to be the frontrunner to buy Arcadia’s Topshop, which is being auctioned off alongside the group’s other brands, including Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Miss Selfridge. Arcadia, the biggest retail casualty of the pandemic, employed 13,000 people across 500 outlets and the Asos deal is likely to just be for Topshop’s online presence. The Boohoo deal is likely to mean that the rest of Debenhams, which still employs more than 10,000 people, will now be split up, the FT reported. Boohoo has come under fire during the pandemic after an investigation by the Guardian revealed last year that workers in parts of its supply chain in Leicester may be being paid as little as £3 to £4 an hour. Allegations were also made that its suppliers forced workers to continue in cramped conditions during the first Covid lockdown. The company accepted the recommendations of a report from Allison Levitt QC, which described its attitude to the plight of workers in the city as “inexcusable”. Debenhams declined to comment on Sunday while Boohoo could not be reached."
2021-01-24T19:23:46Z,business,Business,Dr Martens bosses and backers set for huge windfall in £3.5bn float,"The British footwear brand Dr Martens is expected to launch a stock market flotation on Monday that would value the Northamptonshire firm at £3.5bn and generate a huge windfall for its bosses and backers. The company, known for its boots with chunky air-cushioned soles and distinctive yellow stitching, was owned until 2013 by the Griggs family, who sold to the private equity investment group Permira for £300m but retained a near-10% stake. Just seven years later the business has soared in value and when it lands on the stock market will create numerous multimillionaires. If the float proceeds successfully it should result in a £350m payout for 22 senior staff. They include the chief executive, Kenny Wilson, who only joined the company two years ago and is in line for a stake worth £58m. He previously worked for Cath Kidston, which collapsed last year. The chairman, Paul Mason, who was once chief executive of Asda, will also receive a multimillion-pound windfall. A group of former Dr Martens staff will receive shares worth £150m between them, while about 2,200 more junior employees are expected to get cash bonuses. Senior executives at Permira are also likely to get a big payout. As a result of their fees and bonuses they will share a pool of cash that, according to Peter Morris, an associate scholar at Saïd Business School in Oxford, is likely to be worth £485m if the company is valued at £3.5bn. Richard Hyman, a partner at the retail consultancy TPC, said: “It’s a hell of a lot of money. You are paying for growth well into the future when the future has never been so uncertain.” He said Wilson’s credentials as a “really good leader and retailer” justified the valuation in part. Maureen Hinton, a global retail analyst at the data firm Global Data, said: “Dr Martens are riding on a fashion wave. On Instagram you see many influencers wearing it. If you are all sat at home, you are looking more at social media … Younger people do go out and it appeals to a younger age group.” She said that Dr Martens had a big global opportunity, especially among wealthy young people in the Asia-Pacific region. The Griggs family’s 10% stake will be worth £330m. The first pair of UK-made Dr Martens boots were produced in 1960. Sales of the classic 1460 and other Dr Martens boots have boomed in recent years, rising from £160m in 2013 to £672m in the year to March 2020. Dr Martens, which now sells 11m pairs of shoes and boots a year across more than 60 countries, has managed to weather the Covid-19 pandemic well, despite lockdowns that forced its 130 high street stores to shut. Sales rose 18% to £318m in the six months to September while profits grew by a third to £86.3m. The majority of sales come from its wholesale business, which sells to retailers.
The footwear brand began as a collaboration between a small shoe factory in Northamptonshire and two doctors in Munich, one of whom, Dr Klaus Märtens had developed an air-cushioned chunky sole in 1947 after a foot operation following a skiing accident. The shoe-making Griggs family acquired the licence and designed the 1460 in April 1960 (hence the name). The boots grew in popularity after being adopted by skinheads in the 1960s, and later became fashion staples among punks and goths. More recently chunky boots have become mainstream fashion, with themodel turned actor Agyness Deyn and the singer Rihanna among wearers. The Dr Martens share sale is one of a number of of stock market listings being lined up as owners seek to cash in on buoyant stock markets. London investment banks are also lining up public listings of Deliveroo, the online gifts and cards group Moonpig and the online review site Trustpilot."
2021-01-24T17:53:19Z,business,Business,Tesla investment reaps $29bn profit for Edinburgh fund manager,"Elon Musk has made so much money from Tesla that he is now the richest person on the planet. However, the second-biggest winners are investors in an Edinburgh-based investment manager that began backing Musk’s electric car company in 2013. Baillie Gifford’s investments in Tesla have made an extraordinary $29bn (£21bn) for investors including pension funds, foundations and charities, according to figures released to the Guardian. Tech companies have seen their values soar this year following a surge in profits as the pandemic has driven the adoption of digital services and moves to de-carbonise economies has accelerated the purchase of electric cars. Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are also expected to report bumper sales and profits when they report their latest quarterly results on Tuesday and Wednesday. Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, which is managed by Baillie Gifford, began buying Tesla heavily in 2013 when the shares were changing hands at about $6 each. Tesla’s shares, which have risen by 640% in the past year alone, closed at $846 on Friday valuing the California electric car company at $802bn – which makes it worth about 25 times as much as Tesco. The soaring Tesla share price led Scottish Mortgage to be admitted into the FTSE 100 index of the UK’s biggest listed companies in 2017. Last year Scottish Mortgage was the best-performing company in the FTSE 100. The Scottish Mortgage data comes as Tesla is expected to report its sixth consecutive quarter of increased profits on Wednesday following years of losses as it invested in getting the technology right. Analysts expect Tesla to record fourth quarter sales of $10.5bn, up from $7.4bn a year earlier. Analysts will be keen to see what targets Musk sets for Tesla in 2021. In October, one analyst predicted sales this year of 840,000 to 1m vehicles. At the time Musk said his own target was “in that vicinity” and the analyst was “not far off”. The company came within a whisker of hitting its 500,000 car sales target for 2020, selling 499,550 vehicles despite the pandemic shutting down some production. As Tesla’s share price continued to soar in value it triggered a warning alarm that the Tesla stake had crossed the maximum percentage value that Scottish Mortgage was able to hold in any single stock. That meant fund managers James Anderson and Tom Slater had to sell Tesla’s shares to keep within their rules. Baillie Gifford, the fund management group that includes the flagship Scottish Mortgage fund, has made a $14.8bn profit for its investors from Tesla shares it has sold during the last calendar year. It also made $14.6bn on the shares it has retained in Tesla, leaving a total profit of $29.5bn for 2020. Scottish Mortgage’s total profit on Tesla in 2020 was $5.5bn. Anderson, who first made the decision to invest in Tesla in 2013, said if the fund had not acted to sell some of Tesla shares, the stock would have accounted for more than a third of the whole fund. Tesla is still Scottish Mortgage’s largest holding at 8.9% of total assets. Explaining why he first bought Tesla, at a time when many experienced investors thought it was hugely overvalued at $6 a share, Anderson said: “To us it was, frankly, clear even back half a dozen years that the underlying technologies from batteries, to solar to eventually self-driving were progressing and would continue to do so. “We thought (and simply observed) that Tesla was already past the technological and practical challenges to a good degree and that execution and finance were the practical issues. What we needed was time. Not many investors can have that luxury and necessity.” Anderson said he believes the electric car revolution could only have been started by a maverick outsider such as Musk, and said he deserves the record-breaking $55.8bn bonus he is on track to collect.
“Let’s be clear that we thought this could only be done by a visionary from outside the traditional industry,” Anderson said. “We’re usually sceptics of management rewards but Elon deserves it. So, more recently, does his burgeoning team. “This leads on to a core belief: that our purpose as investors is to assist beneficial, transformation change. Isn’t this the point of capital allocation? If we do this our results for shareholders will look after themselves.” Anderson said Scottish Mortgage had used the funds realised by selling Tesla to buy into other future tech firms, such as Swedish green battery maker Northvolt. •This article was amended on 25 January 2021 to clarify that Baillie Gifford is an investment manager rather than a single investment fund"
2021-01-24T11:34:58Z,business,Business,"Labour bids to be seen as able and competent, not bold and radical | Larry Elliott","Big economic shocks tend to do for prime ministers. Jim Callaghan was finished after the winter of discontent, and the writing was on the wall for John Major once the Bank of England lost its fight with George Soros and his fellow speculators on Black Wednesday. Gordon Brown would have had a decent chance of beating David Cameron had it not been for the financial crash. Brown’s defeat in 2010 was the start of a run of four election defeats for Labour, something that last happened between 1979 and 1992. Since it became a party of government in the 1920s it has never lost five in a row. A year ago, in the immediate aftermath of its worst showing since the 1930s, that looked highly likely. Even now, the chances of Sir Keir Starmer becoming prime minister are probably no better than 50-50. That, though, is progress. The pandemic has clearly helped, even though the hit to the Conservative party’s support has been far less severe than in the aftermath of Black Wednesday. That might have something to do with voters being reluctant to blame Boris Johnson for a crisis that was not of his own making, or it may be that the public cuts the Conservative party more slack than it does Labour. Brown handled the financial crisis far more assuredly than Johnson has dealt with Covid-19. There may be a bit more to it than that. Broadly, voters appear to approve of the general thrust of government economic policy over the past year: they like the furlough, the VAT holiday, the grants to businesses and all the other stimulus measures, even though the result will be a record peacetime deficit this year. If anything – witness the U-turns Johnson has been forced into by Marcus Rashford’s school meals campaign – they would be happy to see the Treasury fork out still more. Not all Tories are comfortable with this approach. Rishi Sunak, it is said, wants to start repairing the hole in the public finances in his budget on 3 March, not just because he is worried by the risk that the financial markets will turn nasty but because he wants to build up a war chest for tax cuts ahead of a 2024 election. If the chancellor really thinks this is a good idea he is not nearly as clever as people give him credit for, because the prime minister is now strongly hinting that tough social distancing restrictions will last into the late spring – and perhaps longer. That means continued generous financial support. Otherwise, firms that have been kept open for the past year will go bust and the people who have been spared the dole queue will lose their jobs. That is the road to a weaker recovery and slower progress in reducing the deficit. What’s more, Sunak should not assume that just because voters thought Labour’s spending proposals in the 2019 election were too good to be true they will necessarily be up for a bit of belt tightening now. More likely, they will think it only fair that people who work in theatres and nightclubs should continue to have their wages paid all the time their workplaces are closed. For similar reasons, Sunak will be taking a big risk if he ends the £20-a-week top-up to universal credit. Labour smells an opportunity here, as was obvious from the Mais lecture delivered this month by the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds. This was an important speech, interesting both for what it said and for what it didn’t say. What Dodds said was that the Tories had made a pig’s ear of the Covid-19 crisis by delaying action and that the economic damage would have been less had the government followed Labour’s recommendations to respond more speedily to the scientific advice. Starmer wants Labour to be seen as a competent party rather than an ideological party. To ram home that message, Dodds made clear that there was no question of a Labour government giving orders to the Bank of England, which would remain fully independent. She clearly has no time for modern monetary theory, the idea that central banks can be ordered to finance government spending and that the only constraint on them doing so is rising inflation. As far as the Treasury is concerned, Dodds said she wanted management of the public finances to be governed by pragmatism not dogmatism, and by a “relentless focus” on value for money. Nothing to frighten the horses there, either. Two things were left unspoken. First, while there was criticism of the government’s brinkmanship in the pre-Christmas Brexit trade talks, there was an acceptance that Brexit has now happened and Labour needs to move on. Starmer is not thinking about taking Britain back into the EU; instead he is working on plans for how Labour should respond to the new opportunities and challenges that Brexit presents.
Second, there was no mention of nationalisation – a big part of Jeremy Corbyn’s platform at both the 2017 and 2019 elections. A Starmer government would toughen up competition policy and bring in anti-trust rules before it would take industries under state control. Starmer and Dodds appear to have come to the same conclusion that Tony Blair and Brown came to in the 1990s: Labour needs to eschew radical policies if it is to avoid losing again. Andrew Scattergood, co-chair of the pressure group Momentum, said after the Mais lecture that it was not enough for Labour to be more competent managers of the same rigged system, but Starmer and Dodds probably won’t lose too much sleep about being taken to task for not offering something bigger and bolder. They want to be seen as competent managers. That’s the point."
2021-01-24T11:00:44Z,business,Business,What is the state of small business in 2021? | Gene Marks,"Earlier this month I sat down for a conversation with four top executives from leading companies that together have served millions of small businesses through the Covid pandemic. As we begin to emerge from what historians will look back on as a time of great challenges and economic upheaval, I wanted to better understand what small businesses have learned from the experience, and what lessons will be applied for the future. Here are the biggest takeaways from the discussion (which I’ve edited for clarity) with René Lacerte, chief executive and co-founder of accounts payable processor Bill.com; Stephen Markwell, who is the head of treasury services product strategy for commercial banking at JP Morgan; Dean Henry the executive vice-president of global business financing and supplier payments at American Express and Rodney Fong; the president & chief executive at the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. The biggest 2020 issue wasn’t Covid – it was the uncertainty created by Covid Rene Lacerte The year you had social unrest, you had the fires, the hurricanes, you had the political environment. All of this uncertainty actually created a challenge for business to know what’s coming and that uncertainty is just hard to react to. And it still is challenging. I think people are moving through it. Businesses have adapted and they’ve come out of the lows of the pandemic. They’re still cautious, but they’re moving forward. Even with uncertainty, many businesses did better than expected Dean Henry One of the customers that we have is a guy named Luke Holden. He’s the CEO of Luke’s Lobster. Luke has 30 restaurants in the US and in Japan and he quickly pivoted his business to optimize. He’s selling lobster meat and seafood delicacies to his customer base on social media digitally. I personally credit a lot of the success of small business to taking advantage of the e-commerce and payment flexibility that the entire industry and ecosystem has provided. Racial equality will be a focus Stephen Markwell The pandemic has really exacerbated racial inequalities, and especially amongst historically underserved small businesses. I think businesses around the world are thinking about how we change that and how do we drive for equality. We’ve committed billions to help advance racial equality with one of the programs adding 15,000 loans to small businesses that are in the Black and Latinx communities. Rodney Fong For those new entrepreneurs that we’re talking about, especially in communities of color that maybe it’s their first venture, I think we have an opportunity to really help them out. We don’t know exactly how that is but we should learn along with them and create that opportunity. And so, at least the Chamber of Commerce, we’re going to try our best to do that, to support those new entrepreneurs. And it’s going to be different. Work from home is the new required benefit Gene Marks Working from home is going to be a required employee benefit for all companies, big and small. And I think that small businesses that don’t recognize this and go back to their old ways are going to miss out on hiring good, talented people because, like health insurance and retirement, I think people are going to expect that there’s work from home options. Technology will create a new renaissance of entrepreneurs Rodney Fong I do honestly believe there’s going to be another renaissance of entrepreneurs that will take advantage of some of the commercial rents that are now lower. People will take chances because they may not have the same expense burden in opening businesses as they did before. I’m extremely bullish about how San Francisco and other major cities will bounce back. It’s not going to be exactly the same. You may not see the same number of people hustling bustling across the street, but I do believe that quality over quantity is going to be sort of the next mantra. More startups are coming Stephen Markwell The barriers to entry have probably never been lower than they are today. It is literally over a thousand times cheaper to start up a business today as compared to 15 years ago. And this is fueled by the front, middle and back office moving to the cloud. It’s fueled by application connectivity and open source and a number of other factors. And it’s a strong funding environment, which we think we’ll see at least through 2022, if not longer. This bodes really well for startups. And I think these small businesses will natively be more adaptable and resilient. Logistics will create challenges, and opportunities Stephen Markwell We completed a survey on business leaders’ outlook and one of the questions was around the pivot to e-commerce from a distribution perspective. Two figures that came out was that about 12% of them pivoted to a complete e-commerce sales distribution model and another 14% plan to do so next year. Rodney Fong Land costs in San Francisco right now are going down. The idea of purchasing a warehouse in San Francisco probably really wasn’t even a thought of a year ago, two years ago. Now it is. This will change the landscape of the wholesale world and the supply chain. The future looks bright Rene Lacerte Small businesses are resilient. And I think many have learned that they can adapt and they can move faster than they ever thought they could. Change is here and businesses are resilient and they need to embrace the change and embrace the opportunity that’s coming."
2021-01-24T07:00:39Z,business,Business,Brexit has left us all at sea – even the fishing industry,"Teething troubles? Bumps in the road? Pull the other one, Mr Gove. As the daily news from fishing crews, farmers, road hauliers, wine merchants, musicians and thousands of businesses up and down the land – not least in Northern Ireland – confirms, Brexit tier 3 is indeed a disaster. Far from having teething troubles that disappear, many of these businesses are having their commercial teeth extracted. It becomes increasingly manifest by the day that this is a Conservative act of conscious economic self-harm which, in an ideal world, would be rescinded before things get a lot worse. Not to put too fine a point upon it, Brexit is not only a disaster: it is also plain stupid. The great Johnson/Gove/Frost “deal” is unravelling in front of their own eyes – and, indeed, in front of the eyes of our friends in continental Europe. While British Brexiters seize every opportunity to blame Brussels for the chaos they themselves have engineered, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, points out that “there are mechanical, obvious, inevitable consequences when you leave the single market and that’s what the British wished to do”. Or did they? Did the 37% of the electorate that voted to leave on that fatal June day four and a half years ago really wish to leave the single market? Did most of them even know what it was? Certainly, the Brexiter members of the cabinet did not know, and, as I have reported before, had to have the single market and the customs union explained to them by Sir Ivan Rogers, our former ambassador to the EU. I think that the Brexiter Daniel (now Lord) Hannan did understand what the single market was. Hannan is not widely known to the general public but, as a sometime rightwing member of the European parliament, he was most influential in the Brexit cause.
However, I seem to recall that his motivation was all about this phantasmagoric notion of “sovereignty”, which so many Brexiters confuse with power. If I remember correctly, he wanted the UK to remain in the single market! But it is leaving that market – regarded by my good Remainer friend Kenneth Clarke as Margaret Thatcher’s greatest achievement – that is causing so much trouble. Brexit done? Sorry, those of you Leave-voting trawler crews now concerned about your future, but welcome to Brexit. Now, the fishing industry was told by Michael Gove’s gang that the deal had increased its share of the catch entitlement in UK fishing waters by two thirds, whereas Tim Harford and his admirable BBC Radio 4 programme about statistics, More or Less, has established that the actual figure is 8%. No wonder Gove, the minister for the Cabinet Office, has “had enough of experts”: they check up on the Brexiters’ mendacious claims. What did Johnson, Gove and co claim? That Brexit would free us from all that Brussels red tape and wasteful bureaucracy. And what has the great deal achieved? The strangulation of cross-Channel and cross-Irish Sea trade, the erection of huge regulatory barriers in the UK, and an increase in costly, very British, bureaucracy. Leaving perfectly sensible trading arrangements was always guaranteed to end in tears. We – or some of us – have done it to ourselves, but there was a time when the French were the suckers. Older readers will recall that in November 1806 Napoleon, with the Berlin decree, set up what was known as the continental blockade (blocus continental) – an embargo on trade with Britain applied by France and its allies. Britain managed to relocate much of its trade to the Americas, and French trade suffered badly. In effect, Napoleon shot himself in the foot, which is what Johnson is doing now. President Biden and his team know this only too well. Wonderful, is it not, how Johnson has suddenly decided he has to cultivate his friend Donald Trump’s successor! All this stuff about hoping that the UK will be Biden’s first port of call is cringe-making. As the man who headed Biden’s transition team, Ted Kaufman, said last week, the new president will be coming here in June for the G7 summit, which it happens to be our government’s turn to host. I have little doubt that Biden will be advising Johnson that it is time to cultivate a group of countries known as the European Union, rather than be telling them that they are not entitled to have an ambassador here. I wonder whether, one day, any members of this Brexit-mad cabinet will write some repentant memoirs. If so, they might be tempted to quote one of the many great lines in Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner: “We were a ghastly crew.”"
2021-01-24T00:05:30Z,business,Business,Even Diageo's cocktail of brands won't guarantee heady profits in a pandemic,"Looking into the bottom of the glass as another evening draws to an end in an interminable winter lockdown, it may be tempting to believe the amount we drink has gone up. What else is there to do? Yet the experience of Diageo, maker of brands from Guinness to Johnnie Walker whisky and Smirnoff vodka, suggests something quite different: even if home drinking has picked up, the industry is missing the social drinker. The closure of pubs, bars and restaurants has forced alcohol companies into an abrupt rethink, as the balance shifts away from social venues and towards drinks bought for the home at off-licences or, increasingly, online. At its interim results on Thursday, Diageo will give further indications of whether home drinkers made up for a Christmas somewhat lacking in festive spirits. City forecasters expect revenues of £6.2bn for the second half of 2020, a near-£1bn hit compared with the previous year. That would represent a costly loss of trade but an improvement on a first half dominated by the start of the pandemic. Diageo’s sales fell by 23% in the first half of 2020, whereas the expected drop for the latest six months, to the end of December, is about 14%.
The off-licence trade had remained robust, Diageo told the market in an update last September. A lot has changed since then as the pandemic’s second wave struck Europe, but investors will be hoping sales in the US – where restrictions are not uniform – will have been resilient, and that big banqueting occasions will help the recovery in China, which has controlled the virus more effectively. Diageo is at heart a financial construct. It lacks the romanticism of its brands by design: the company’s soulless corporate identity was created in 1997 after the merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan, deliberately playing up “everyday” mundanity. Diageo is just a portfolio of much livelier brands, with attendant cost savings and the benefits of diversification. If an unlikely gin craze sweeps the world, it can benefit; if tequila booms, it is ready and waiting. And if consumers want drinks without the hangover it will invest in “no- and low-alcohol” as well – notwithstanding the embarrassing safety recall of its Guinness 0.0 drink shortly after launch. Analysts at Bank of America suggest that the results will show that Diageo is well-placed among rivals, given the underperformance of shares that are down by about 9% since the start of 2020. They cite an enticing cocktail of steady growth in the US and a faster recovery in poorer countries and even in Europe. At the same time the Brexit deal removes currency uncertainty. Diageo has other attractions: investors will be keeping a beady eye on its dividend. A 2% increase for the last fiscal year maintained a growth streak that stretches back to 1999, according to Russ Mould of investing platform AJ Bell. Yet the global nature of the pandemic has undermined the strength of Diageo’s basket of brands, its geographical diversity and its financial firepower. Diageo shareholders are (like everyone else) nervously watching the distribution of vaccines as they savour the prospect of free-spending drinkers back in pubs and bars. Sales will surely bounce back if vaccines are administered widely in its main markets, but a resurgence of the virus (or the much bleaker prospect of further new variants resistant to vaccines) might be costly. Whatever the merits of online booze shopping or at-home cocktails, the most important determinant of Diageo’s fortunes remains out of its control."
2021-01-23T19:00:25Z,business,Business,Australian government's housing policy continues to ignore low income earners | Greg Jericho,"Both Scott Morrison and Joe Biden use the slogan “build back better”, but what they mean by it reveals some fundamental differences over who they believe the government should care about. This week there was some focus on the homebuilder program after the latest home loan figures showed a strong surge in mortgages for building homes since July. It certainly is an example of a policy working – giving people $25,000 if they take out a loan to build a house will, unsurprisingly, encourage people to do just that. And while it will increase work in construction (yes, governments do create jobs), it is just the latest in a very long line of policies that have focussed on the housing market, in terms of keeping the value of housing rising. The homebuilder program has increased the number of homes to be built for owner-occupiers, but since the depth of the pandemic in June, home loans for established homes have also sharply grown – and that has nothing to do with the program and all to do with record low interest rates.
In effect, as usual, economic policy prioritises people able to afford a home or those already owning one over those who cannot or do not. This week, while the focus of economic data was on home loans and unemployment rates (down slightly – still 1.5% above where it was a year ago), the Productivity Commission released its report on government services and housing and the homeless. It found that in 2018 half of low income households were in rental stress – a figure barely changed from a decade ago. And yet such news never generates attention at the policy level that house prices do.
Graph not showing? Click here Not much has changed in the way the Coalition government approaches housing policy since John Howard in 2003 responded to concerns about affordability by saying that he doesn’t “get people stopping me in the street and saying ‘John you’re outrageous, under your government the value of my house has increased’ ”. And so housing affordability for low and moderate income earners is ignored and continues to deteriorate. The Productivity Commission report found that in 2009-10 there were just 42 homes per 1,000 low-moderate households for sale in NSW that were affordable; by 2017-18 that had fallen to 17. Morrison has talked often about “build back better” and it is a weird coincidence that Biden also uses the phrase. But the same slogan does not mean the same priorities.
Biden talks of raising the minimum wage and his housing policy specifically notes that the USA has “a shortage of available, affordable housing units for low-income individuals”. It notes that “tens of millions of Americans spend more than 30% of their income on housing” and concludes that “it is far past time to put an end to systemic housing discrimination.” These problems occur here as well and yet they are not addressed. The Productivity Commission found that a decade ago 3.9% of households resided in public housing, falling to 3.1% by 2017-18. And yet at the same time rental stress had not fallen and housing affordability for such households had decreased. Clearly the shift has just been about these households being forced through lack of social/public housing supply to move to private rentals and making life worse. While half of those in the private sector suffer rental stress, just under a quarter of those in 2017-18 living in social housing were suffering so. There is no question that life is tougher in the private rental market than if you live in social housing – it’s almost like policies such as negative gearing are more about helping landlords than increasing the rental stock. Investing in building social housing also doesn’t help keep house prices up or directly give money to those who can already afford to build their own home But that’s what happens when your priorities cater to those who you think will vote for you and the rest are left to realise that they are not among those who are entitled to build back at all."
2021-01-23T16:00:21Z,business,Business,The strange case of Alibaba's Jack Ma and his three-month vanishing act,"Wearing burgundy lipstick and a long peroxide wig, the diminutive entrepreneur who would soon become China’s richest man took to the stage and belted out Can You Feel the Love Tonight? from Disney’s The Lion King. Jack Ma, chief executive of e-commerce giant Alibaba, had earned the right to make a spectacle of himself. On that day in September 2009, in front of 16,000 adoring employees packed into Hangzhou’s Yellow Dragon stadium, the eccentric but iron-willed former English teacher was celebrating. He had built a bona fide tech champion, China’s answer to Amazon, eBay and PayPal rolled into one. Little more than a decade on, Ma is experiencing a much less triumphant moment in the spotlight. After nearly three months in which his whereabouts have been unknown, following a public show of dissent towards Beijing, he resurfaced last week, apparently much chastened. His 48-second appearance – in a broadcast from an unknown location – was “like a hostage video”, according to one member of a large online forum of China analysts. Alibaba remains a powerhouse of the Chinese business scene, but Ma has had his wings clipped, having taken the bold and perhaps foolish step of crossing the Communist party, of which he is a member. “I don’t understand what he was thinking,” says Bill Bishop, who writes the China-focused newsletter Sinocism. “That’s not constructive in the Chinese system.” During a summit in Shanghai last October, Ma criticised regulators’ attitude towards big business, accusing them of a “pawnshop” mentality that stifled innovation. “We shouldn’t use the way to manage a train station to regulate an airport,” Ma declared. “We cannot regulate the future with yesterday’s means.” He was speaking just moments after Wang Qishan – righthand man to China’s leader, Xi Jinping – had said much the opposite. Wang had stressed the primacy of safe regulation ensuring that business did not become the master of the state. “[Ma’s speech] was about risk-taking, putting your neck on the line and not minding the instability that comes from that,” says George Magnus, a research associate at Oxford University’s China Centre and the author of Red Flags: Why Xi’s China Is in Jeopardy. “That’s anathema to the philosophy of Xi Jinping’s party.”
Ma’s direct contradiction of Beijing’s rhetoric went viral on social media, adding to the potential embarrassment for the Communist party. He might have been worth more than £35bn, but it swiftly became clear who was boss. Within a fortnight, the entrepreneur and two of his lieutenants were summoned to meet financial regulators. A day later, the imminent stock market flotation of Ant Group – an online finance company spun out of Alibaba that includes the digital payments system Alipay – was cancelled. Regulators cited “changes to the financial technology regulatory environment and other major issues”, but the prevailing narrative was that Ma was being punished at the cost of Ant Group’s initial public offering (IPO). Shares in Alibaba, which owns part of Ant, fell more than 8%, whittling down Ma’s net worth by more than £2bn. Authorities in Beijing also ordered an investigation into allegations of “monopolistic practices” at Alibaba – as well as fellow tech firm Tencent – and later ordered Ant Group to scale down its operations. Bishop agrees that there are genuine reasons for concern about the way Alibaba wields commercial power and its treatment of workers. There is also, he believes, genuine anxiety among regulators about the systemic risk inherent in Ant’s model of originating numerous small loans. But the idea that Ma’s public show of dissent was not at the root of the last-ditch intervention in the Ant Group float is, says Bishop, “crazy”. “It’s China, it’s the Communist party – it’s always political. He basically embarrassed the vice-president and the regulators … four days later his IPO is pulled. “If it was purely regulatory concern, why let it get to IPO? It’s pretty obvious that his speech that day was somehow the trigger.” Rumours abound that it was Xi personally who pulled the plug. Magnus, who has charted Xi’s style of government, emphasises his regime’s steady march away from its flirtation with “marketisation”. Instead, Xi’s China has gravitated towards a Leninist ideological approach, imposed via the “United Front” network of businesses and groups whose interests must align with those of the party. “Jack Ma happens to be one of the most popular and well-known people who has fallen foul of the leadership’s new angst about people growing too big for their boots and having powers that seem to rival the authority of the party itself,” he says. “If entrepreneurs are politically compliant, they will thrive. If they’re not compliant they will not thrive and will be subject to the kind of treatment Jack Ma has just been the victim of.” During the three months that Ma was missing, speculation was rife. Some said that the 56-year-old had fled the country, others that he was just keeping a low profile and had been seen on the golf course. The rumour mill accelerated when he was abruptly replaced as a judge on the TV talent show Africa’s Business Heroes. The very fact of Ma’s reappearance sent Alibaba’s shares up 8.5% on the day the video of him was confirmed as genuine, but his return has not necessarily cleared things up. In the video, dated 10 January but released last week, Ma devoted himself not to matters of regulation and business but to uplifting China’s rural poor. “My colleagues and I have been learning and thinking, and we have become more determined to devote ourselves to education and public welfare,” he said, addressing teachers at a rural school.
He had, he said, reached the conclusion that Chinese entrepreneurs should be devoting their time to “rural revitalisation and common prosperity” – both key parts of the Xi agenda. Magnus points out that it is impossible to know whether Ma is under some form of detention. His current whereabouts are not certain either. And the fact that his businesses have become so integral to everyday financial transactions for many Chinese people may not protect him. “Do they have to be careful with him? Some might think so, because his elevated position is a bit like Bill Gates or someone like that. To be honest with you, if the party was really anxious about him and his influence, I don’t think they’d have any qualms about shutting him away.” Domestic and foreign investors have been not just bruised by the failed flotation of Ant Group, but reminded of what is expected of them. “Starting last summer, we began to hear a lot more about what Xi’s vision is for private entrepreneurs and how they fit within the objective of the great rejuvenation that he’s pushing,” says Bishop. “Xi has brought up patriotic entrepreneurs from the last century who made a lot of money and then did a lot for the country and a lot for the party. The politically savvy business folks see that as a shifting political wind that they have to be more sensitive to.”"
2021-01-23T16:00:20Z,business,Business,New Covid infections pose challenge to China's growth and Xi's leadership,"When Britain was in its second lockdown last November and the economy was contracting, China’s quarterly growth rate was hitting 6.5%. Figures last week showed that for the full year, the world’s second-largest economy could boast a growth rate of 2.3% while all its rivals in Europe and the Americas were going backwards. The trend could be traced back to Beijing’s efforts to tackle the virus – albeit after a period of denial – and keep infection rates among the lowest in the world. But the week-long new year public holiday from 11 February will be a stiff test of Beijing’s ability to keep the pandemic in check and its economy growing. Officials have told the many hundreds of millions of people who traditionally travel to visit relatives – and this year celebrate the year of the ox – that they should stay at home to keep the infection rate under control. A spiral of cases in Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, has dented President Xi Jinping’s claim that the virus was beaten last year and only the west mishandled events to allow a second wave. Xi has gambled on rural migrants being tested before returning home, and on local officials being able to deal with isolated outbreaks via a mix of threats and modest compensation payments. China’s ministry of transport says it expects new year holiday travel to be 40% down on 2019, but that still means millions will be taking public transport in a short space of time. China expert Diana Choyleva of forecaster Enodo Economics says she will be watching to see if China can get to March without a fully fledged new outbreak of Covid-19: “Xi has boxed himself in. A second lockdown would undermine the narrative that the virus is already beaten. And he can’t lock down again without ruining a second year of celebrations and possibly the 100th anniversary of the Chinese communist party in July. That would not just be a blow to the party, it would slow the economic recovery as well.”
Consultancy Capital Economics has pencilled in a growth rate for China of 10% this year, despite a downturn in travel. “The hit to consumption and services should be mostly offset by factories being able to put more staff to work over the holiday than usual,” says senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard. Choyleva adds that the anniversary of the CCP will mark a bigger turning point than many observers expect. All bets are off after July, she says, when Xi is expected to embark on a further consolidation of his position, clamping down on corporate corruption and private sector monopolies. China’s factories are, she says, also reliant on orders for electronic and electrical goods from locked-down consumers in Europe and the US. “Once lockdowns lift in the west and vaccines allow people to eat in restaurants and use services, demand for Chinese goods will decline,” she says. Evans-Pritchard agrees that waning demand for Chinese goods will hit firms – and coincide with increased borrowing costs. The People’s Bank of China has already reversed the looser borrowing rules brought in last year, and he expects it to extend this with formal interest rate increases. For much of the past decade, China’s regional authorities have tried to wean themselves off income from heavy industry, most of it state-owned. But each time there is a crisis, officials reach for any policy that delivers an immediate boost to heavy industry (such as steel or car production). Debts from failed investments have climbed to dangerous levels and carbon emissions are increasing too. Last year was no exception. And reversing the trend is becoming harder. Enodo’s Nigel Inkster, who is a former deputy director of MI6, says in his new book, The Great Decoupling: China, America and the Struggle for Technological Supremacy, that the party-state could kill the golden goose of private enterprise – and the innovation that will drive incomes up and carbon emissions down – in its demand for control. “Security and stability trump all other considerations,” he said last week. “Absolutely everything is about ensuring the Communist party remains in power. They will trample over whoever they need to trample over.”"
2021-01-23T08:00:11Z,business,Business,'It's a big deal': why former protester turned Davos mayor wants WEF back,"In his youth, Philipp Wilhelm was at the forefront of protests against the World Economic Forum’s annual “extreme capitalism” gathering of the business and political elite in Davos, the Swiss mountain resort where he grew up. Now, however, Wilhelm is the mayor of the town and his central mission is to ensure the return of the WEF jamboree, which had been scheduled to start next week but was cancelled this year due to the pandemic. “It’s a very big deal that the WEF is not coming to Davos this year,” Wilhelm, 32, said in a video interview from his office in the town hall. “A lot of companies, and a lot of people, rely on revenue from the WEF and it’s a very difficult time for them with the pandemic and without the WEF meeting. Some of the businesses are really dependent on the WEF week, when a few of them may make about 40% of their annual income.”
Every January since 1971 – with the exception of 2002, when the WEF meeting relocated to New York in a show of solidarity in the wake of the 9/11 terror attack – thousands of the world’s richest and most influential people, their aides, security guards and the media have descended on the snowy slopes of Davos for the WEF meeting. While businesses, hoteliers and apartment landlords relish the opportunity to jack up their prices 10-fold or more, many of the town’s residents complain about endless traffic jams, pollution, intense security checks and the corrupting influence of the global super-rich on the morality of young people. Every year, Davos residents are joined by protesters from across Switzerland and the rest of Europe demanding an end to the meeting – or that it at least attempts to better represent all of society and acknowledges global challenges such as the climate crisis. In the early 2010s, in the wake of the financial crisis, Wilhelm joined the protests over several years. “In my early days I was demonstrating during the WEF for better action against climate change and social justice. Now I am trying to get the WEF back to Davos,” he said with a laugh. Wilhelm, who in November became the first member of the leftwing Social Democratic party (SP) to be elected mayor of Davos, said it was his experiences at the protests that led him to stand for office. “Actually, I got into politics thanks to the WEF, because I started to think about how the economy works, how politics work,” he said. “It was my entrance point.” Since then, Wilhelm says both he and the WEF have changed their positions, and he said he can do much more to influence policy from inside the steel ring of security that surrounds the Davos congress centre. But he also warned Davos businesses that are missing the money they would have collected during the WEF – which will this year meet in a pared-down event in Singapore in May – that they had allowed themselves to become too reliant on the WEF money train. The WEF, he said, brings in €50m-€60m to the local economy. “Some take it for granted, that this kind of revenue will come every year no matter what,” Wilhelm said. “Now, of course it’s not a good time, but it is a time when a lot of people are realising not to take anything for granted. ” One of the biggest financial losers from the WEF’s non-appearance this year will be the Steigenberger Grandhotel Belvédère, the fanciest hotel in Davos, where many world leaders and chief executive stay. Tina Heide, the hotel’s general manager, said that in ordinary years the hotel drafts in dozens of extra staff to cope with demand and erects 25,000 sq metres of temporary buildings on the hotel’s grounds to host 70 meeting rooms and an extra 18 event venues. The world’s TV networks also set up mini TV studios on the hotel’s roofs. But this year the hotel has closed half its rooms, and is only employing 44 of its usual 100 staff.
Opposite the Belvédère, Facebook usually spends several hundred thousand dollars renting land from the Kirchner Museum art gallery to build a three-storey temporary “Facebook house”. Severin Bischof, the director of the museum, which holds one of the largest collections of paintings by the German expressionist Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, said the museum has enough money in its reserves to continue without Facebook’s money this year. But he said the town’s citizens should take this an opportunity to think about a future without the WEF. “People here hadn’t thought of the possibility that the WEF would stop coming here,” he said. “Now that prospect is very concrete. Some people are missing out on a lot of revenue, and we have to think if we are too reliant on it. “Everyone knows someone who rents out their homes for the WEF; for some the money for that one week can pay the rent for the rest of the year.” However, the real winners usually are commercial landlords who proscribe in contracts that households must leave their homes during the WEF. “The money goes to the landlord, not the people who live in the homes, who have to leave each year,” said Bischof, who does not rent out his flat, on principle. “During the WEF, the moral compass changes, and it is all about money,” he said. “The values that we hold dear the rest of the year are out of the window [during the WEF], and maybe that’s not good for us as a society. “The people that come here for WEF – the multimillionaires and multi-billionaires bring their the ideology and neoliberal capitalist system. There is huge inequality in the world and they are literally the representatives of the 1%, actually, the 0.001%. “For me personally it is quite nice not to have the WEF this year, all the construction work isn’t happening, the security isn’t here, you can walk around as a free person,” he said. “You can even smell it in the air that WEF is not here. The air smells fresher without them and their limos.”"
2021-01-22T22:30:07Z,business,Business,"Invest in UK industry to drive switch to electric cars, says Labour","The Labour party has called for the government to invest billions of pounds in the UK car industry to help it recover from the coronavirus pandemic and to push forward the transition towards electric cars. The stimulus for motor manufacturers envisaged by Labour would be on a similar scale to the support given by Germany and France, which last year earmarked €5bn (£4.4bn) and €8bn, respectively, for their carmakers. The car industry has suffered a torrid year, with the pandemic lockdowns causing the biggest annual drop in car sales since the second world war. At the same time carmakers must still spend heavily on switching production to electric vehicles, ahead of a ban on UK sales of new fossil fuel cars in 2030.
Labour’s plan would include bringing forward investment in electric car chargers, and investing in facilities for battery production – known as gigafactories – and recycling. It would also bring forward procurement of zero-emission buses, a policy strongly backed by UK busmakers who are struggling to make sales. Lucy Powell, Labour’s shadow minister for business and consumers, told the Guardian that the UK had an “opportunity for growth” beyond the European Union if investments in electric vehicle technology were made now. “Sectors like automotive, aerospace too, are competing in that global economy; that pan-European economy,” said Powell. “If we don’t keep up with the level of support and particularly the level of stimulus that’s going into these sectors, in Germany and France, we’re going to see the demise of these sectors a lot faster.” The government was not doing enough to help the UK car industry transition, preferring to leave it to market forces, she said. Estimates from the government-backed Faraday Institution suggest 105,000 UK workers’ jobs are at risk in the next two decades without new gigafactories being built.
Powell said the automotive stimulus would be a “significant chunk” of the £30bn green recovery plan proposed by Labour in November, although she declined to detail the exact cost of the policies. Germany and France funnelled money to their car industries partly via subsidies for new cars, although they faced criticism both for helping companies whose finances remained relatively intact, as well as for helping sales of hybrid cars with polluting internal combustion engines. Labour’s plan would not include policies such as a scrappage scheme to lower the cost of electric vehicles for buyers directly. Powell also said an increase in fuel duty, a policy that would disincentivise petrol or diesel car ownership as well as raising revenues, was not part of the plan."
2021-01-22T19:48:59Z,business,Business,Asos emerges as contender in Topshop bidding war following Arcadia breakup,"Asos has emerged as a serious contender in the bidding war for Topshop as a narrowing field of bidders vies for control of one of the high street’s best-known fashion brands. The brand is part of Sir Philip Green’s fashion empire Arcadia which collapsed into administration last year. It is being auctioned off alongside the group’s other brands which include Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Miss Selfridge. Arcadia, which employed 13,000 people across 500 outlets, has been the biggest high street casualty of the pandemic. High street rival Next, which was working with the US hedge fund Davidson Kempner, pulled out of the auction on Thursday. In a statement, the consortium said it had been “unable to meet the price expectations of the vendor” amid speculation that Topshop, Arcadia’s prime asset, could fetch between £250m and £300m. The remaining bidders in the Arcadia auction are thought to include Shein, a Chinese online fashion retailer and Authentic Brands, the US owner of the Barneys department store. Online group Boohoo is also thought to be still involved. If Asos wins the day it would be bad news for Topshop shop staff as it is an online business which does not operate any stores. Asos chief executive Nick Beighton has played his cards close to his chest but analysts say Topshop would be a good fit; it already sells the brand on its website and serves a similar demographic.
Arcadia, which Green bought for £850m in 2002, is home to a stable of household names including Topshop, Topman, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis, Miss Selfridge and Burton. Evans, its plus-size clothing brand, has already been hived off and sold to City Chic Collective, an Australian retailer, for £23m. Arcadia was struggling before coronavirus took a hammer to the high street with the most recent set of accounts available showing a loss of £177m on sales of £1.8bn in 2018. Although Topshop’s market share had fallen sharply in recent years analysts think still think it has annual sales of around £600m. The pandemic was the final straw for Arcadia, which along non-essential retailers was forced to close its stores for long periods of time. By contrast business has boomed for online players with Asos’s UK sales up 36% in the last four months of 2020."
2021-01-22T19:00:04Z,business,Business,Tourism minister in talks with industry on post-jobkeeper support package,"The Morrison government is considering offering targeted financial assistance to the tourism industry because international travel is likely to remain restricted for up to a year, the minister responsible for the sector has signalled. Dan Tehan, whose portfolio includes trade as well as tourism, said Australia was “very unlikely to see international tourism for the next nine to 12 months” so the part of the sector dependent on arrivals from abroad “remains in a state where it is very difficult for them to succeed economically”. “I’ve already been engaging heavily with the tourism industry to listen to their concerns and also to get thoughts, ideas and feedback from them as to how the government may be able to assist them while we wait for international tourism to come back online,” Tehan told Guardian Australia and other media outlets in a group interview. The approach to tourism contrasts with comments by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, that the government is not considering extending wage subsidies in the hospitality sector.
In the wide-ranging interview, which also touched on his attempts to contact China’s new commerce minister for dialogue about resolving trade tensions, Tehan confirmed he was consulting on the shape of a potential tourism support package. The size of any such assistance remains unclear, but the discussions are taking place amid fears among tourism operators about the scheduled end of the jobkeeper wage subsidy at the end of March and the prospect of extended border closures. Labor has also called for targeted support to continue to hard-hit sectors. Tehan said while he had heard from the sector that it had been a strong summer for domestic tourism, it remained “a very challenging time” for international tourism. He said any decisions would be driven by “economic data that continues to come in around the economic impact on our tourism sector of the pandemic”. “I’ll continue to have those discussions, engage with the sector and look to see whether there is specific or targeted support that could be provided or is needed,” he said. Tehan said one of the key issues was how to target assistance to parts of the sector that were particularly exposed to international tourism. He had asked the sector to provide suggestions for “how you can in any way sort of partition this from the relatively strong growth that we’ve seen with regard to domestic tourism”. When asked this week about continued assistance for the tourism sector beyond March, Scott Morrison did not rule it out but said it was “too early to make those calls”. The prime minister expressed a general view on Thursday that “taxpayers’ money can’t be used endlessly to run the Australian economy”. On Friday, Frydenberg reportedly rejected calls from the Restaurant and Catering Industry Association to extend jobkeeper wage subsidies in the hospitality sector when the rest of the program expires on 31 March. In a letter, first reported in the Australian, Frydenberg said the government recognised “the challenges faced by the accommodation and food services industry”. “However, given the unprecedented levels of support announced by the commonwealth and state and territory governments, I consider that existing policy settings will continue to support a strong economic recovery and we are not contemplating a ‘Hospokeeper’ package at this time.”
Tehan said there was some hope of travel bubbles with New Zealand, Pacific countries and Singapore “if they’re able to continue to successfully deal with the pandemic”, but “the most likely scenario is that we’re probably nine to 12 months away from international tourism as we know it restarting”. He said the government would take the advice of its medical experts as to whether a successful rollout of vaccines globally could allow the border to reopen to international tourists earlier, especially for those who had been vaccinated. Tehan, who was appointed to the trade, tourism and investment portfolio in late December, said he had written to his Chinese counterpart, Wang Wentao, last week to start a discussion on the ongoing trade tensions. Wang, a former governor of the agriculture-producing Heilongjiang province, was also appointed to the Chinese commerce ministry role last month. Tehan said he would be “patient” and play the “long game” in seeking to resolve tensions with Australia’s largest trading partner. Australian ministers last year reported being unable to secure phone calls with their Chinese counterparts, and dozens of ships with Australian coal on board remain stranded off the coast of China. “My hope is that with the appointment of a new minister in China at the same time as my appointment, that we will be able … to get a dialogue in the relationship happening again,” Tehan said. “And I’ve strongly reaffirmed Australia’s commitment to our trade and economic relationship with China.”"
2021-01-22T17:17:31Z,business,Business,"Betfair apologises after keeping punter £100,000 out of pocket for months","Betfair has apologised to one of its customers after he was left out of pocket for many weeks when an attempted deposit of nearly £100,000 to place bets on the US election in November was taken from his bank but did not credit to his account. The customer, a long-standing account holder with the betting exchange who lives in Ireland and bets mainly on horse racing and sport, arranged the transfer of €110,000 (£98,000) a week before the election on 3 November, having confirmed with Betfair’s customer service department that there were no limits on the amount he could deposit and that the deposit would be accepted. He also fulfilled all of the firm’s “KYC” – Know Your Customer – requirements.
When the credit failed to appear on his account statement, he became increasingly concerned that his money had effectively vanished, but despite numerous daily contacts with Betfair’s customer service department, no one could tell him where it had gone. His frustration increased as the election came and went with the money still missing from his exchange account. He then asked Betfair to return the money to the same bank account from which it had been transferred but again, despite “multiple requests and inquiries” to Betfair’s customer relations and escalations departments, the money remained somewhere in the exchange’s coffers. Betfair’s market on the US election was the biggest in the exchange’s history, with around £500m matched on the outcome. Several weeks after it was finally settled, however, and more than 10 weeks after the customer attempted to make his deposit, his £100,000 was still missing. The money was finally returned to his account on Thursday, a few hours after the Guardian asked Betfair to investigate its whereabouts and the delay in returning it. In an email to inform him of the transfer, a Betfair representative apologised for the “inconvenience brought about the delay”. The company declined to offer any further comment when contacted on Friday about the case."
2021-01-22T16:19:58Z,business,Business,Fears of UK double-dip recession rise as activity slumps in Covid-19 lockdown,"Fears that the UK economy is facing a double-dip recession have intensified after a poor Christmas for retailers was followed by a slump in activity in January as tougher lockdown measures took effect. In a triple-whammy of bad news for the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, official figures showing weak consumer spending and the third highest monthly borrowing on record were accompanied by evidence that the UK’s private sector had fallen this month to its lowest level since May. The IHS Markit/Cips monthly healthcheck of the economy showed the service sector – which accounts for 80% of the economy – being especially hard hit by the enforced closure of non-essential retailing, hospitality and leisure. Activity dropped from 49.4 in December to 38.8 in January. Any reading below 50 means activity is falling. Even though factories have remained open, the manufacturing sector also suffered in January from a mixture of Covid-19 effects and Brexit disruption, with its reading falling from 57.5 to 52.9. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: “A steep slump in business activity in January puts the locked-down UK economy on course to contract sharply in the first quarter of 2021, meaning a double-dip recession is on the cards.” Analysts at the investment bank Investec said the PMI falls supported their forecast of the economy contracting by 2.5% in the first quarter of 2021. If official figures also show the economy contracted in the last quarter of 2020, then the UK will have suffered its first double-dip recession – two downturns in quick succession – since the 1970s. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, which the UK economy experienced in the first and second quarters of last year. Meanwhile, UK government borrowing hit its highest for December on record as spending soared in response to the coronavirus pandemic and tax receipts fell. . The Office for National Statistics said borrowing reached £34.1bn last month, about £28bn more than the same month a year ago. The increase took the government’s budget deficit – the gap between spending and tax income plus other receipts – to nearly £271bn for the first nine months of the financial year, a rise of more than £212bn compared with the same period last year. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent forecasting unit, has estimated borrowing will hit £394bn by the end of the financial year in March, which would be the highest peacetime deficit in history. Borrowing is already higher than during the worst of the 2008 financial crisis. The latest rise in borrowing comes as government spending climbed in response to the second wave of the pandemic. The bill for coronavirus job support schemes, including the furlough scheme, in December was £10bn. There was also a bill of £9bn for vaccines, testing and PPE. Total spending was £86bn. Charlie McCurdy, a researcher at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “This level of spending may be eye-wateringly large, but it is absolutely necessary in order to both tackle the virus, and protect families and firms from the crisis.” Separate ONS figures said the volume of British retail sales rose by 0.3% between November and December after the relaxation of the second national lockdown in England – far below economists’ forecasts for growth of 1.2% during the pivotal month for retailers. For the year as a whole, retail sales plunged by 1.9% as the coronavirus pandemic triggered the biggest annual decline on record despite a boom in spending online during lockdown.
According to the latest snapshot, spending in clothing stores jumped by 21.5% as consumer spending recovered from a large decline in November, when much of the high street was closed. Retailers reported a rise in sales at the beginning of the month as people shopped for Christmas presents before tougher restrictions were introduced and Boris Johnson’s government made a last-minute decision to scrap Christmas bubble measures for large parts of the country. Despite the sharp rise in spending on fashion over the festive period, food sales shrank by 3.4%, falling back from a strong growth rate of 2.8% in November when supermarkets had benefited from the closure of pubs, restaurants and other non-essential retailers. The figures come at the end of the worst year for the high street on record in terms of revenue growth. Growing numbers of retailers have faced financial ruin during the pandemic, leading to widespread store closures and job losses across the country."

The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has refused to rule out the possibility of restrictions lasting until the summer, and Germany’s health minister, Jens Spahn, warned against lifting the German lockdown too soon. Markets pared losses after a strong business survey for the US, which showed manufacturing output at a six-year high while the service sector also strengthened in January.

2021-01-22T11:01:45Z,business,Business,Cross-channel power link for 1m British homes opens,"A new high-voltage subsea cable linking the UK to France has begun importing enough electricity to power 1m British homes. The delayed power cable, which is the second interconnector linking the UK to France, will stretch 149 miles along the seafloor between Hampshire in the UK and Normandy in France. The interconnector, known as IFA2, is expected to meet about 1.2% of Britain’s electricity demand and help to reduce the use of fossil fuels by importing electricity generated by France’s nuclear power plants.
The power imports could help to avoid 1.2m tonnes of CO2 from entering the atmosphere in the first year of the interconnector’s operation. In return, the UK will be able to sell any extra clean electricity from its growing fleet of offshore wind turbines, which is expected to quadruple in the next 10 years. The power cable was initially expected to begin importing and exporting 1GW of electricity in the third quarter of last year, before the UK’s peak electricity demand months in the winter, but the project has had several delays.
In a recent update, the developers – a division of National Grid and the French electricity system operator RTE – promised it would be ready by the end of January, 30 years after their first IFA cable project linked the UK and French electricity markets. Jon Butterworth, the managing director of National Grid Ventures, described IFA2 as “the latest feat of world-class engineering helping to transform and decarbonise the electricity systems of Britain and its European neighbours”. He said: “Together we are now able to help deliver cleaner, more secure, and more affordable energy to consumers at both ends of the cable. Our first interconnector together, IFA, has been successfully operating for more than 30 years. We look forward to working together with RTE over the next 30 years, to support the delivery of net zero targets to fight climate change across the UK and Europe.” • This article was amended on 22 January 2021 to clarify that it is 30 years since the first IFA cable project between the National Grid and RTE, not since the first interconnector was set up between the UK and France."
2021-01-22T10:52:00Z,business,Business,UK government borrowing hits highest December level on record,"UK government borrowing hit its highest December level on record as spending soared in response to the coronavirus pandemic coupled with a steep drop in tax receipts. The Office for National Statistics said borrowing hit £34.1bn last month, about £28bn more than the same month a year ago. The increase took the government’s budget deficit – the gap between spending and tax income plus other receipts – to nearly £271bn for the first nine months of the financial year, a rise of more than £212bn compared with the same period last year, as the Covid-19 pandemic far outstripped the damage done by the 2008 financial crisis. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent forecasting unit, has estimated borrowing will hit £394bn by the end of the financial year in March. The latest rise in borrowing comes as government spending climbed in response to the second wave of the pandemic. The bill for coronavirus job support schemes, including the furlough scheme, in December was £10bn. There was also a bill of £9bn for vaccines, testing and PPE. Total spending was £86bn. December’s borrowing pushed the national debt – the sum total of every deficit – to £2.1tn at the end of December, or about 99.4% of gross domestic product (GDP), the highest debt ratio since 1962. Analysts said the furlough scheme alone cost the government £4.7bn in December, a figure that will rise significantly in January after the launch of tougher lockdown controls. However, the cost of inaction would have been mass unemployment and lasting scars on the economy that would have caused longer-term damage to the public finances. Charlie McCurdy, a researcher at the Resolution Foundation, said: “This level of spending may be eye-wateringly large, but it is absolutely necessary in order to both tackle the virus, and protect families and firms from the crisis.” Pressure is mounting on the chancellor to increase financial support to businesses and workers during the latest restrictions, as the pandemic edges Britain’s economy closer to a double-dip recession.
The Guardian revealed on Thursday that ministers were considering paying £500 to everyone in England who tests positive for Covid-19, in a dramatic overhaul of the self-isolation scheme and amid persistently high rates of infection. If adopted universally, that level of payments would cost more than £450m a week. Despite record borrowing, economists, including those at organisations such as the International Monetary Fund, have argued that cutting government spending and raising taxes to reduce the deficit would derail Britain’s recovery. The cost to the government of the soaring national debt has also fallen to the lowest levels since the 1690s, helped by historically low interest rates and the Bank of England’s multibillion-pound quantitative easing bond-buying programme. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the government had invested more than £280bn in protecting jobs and livelihoods since the start of the pandemic. “This has clearly been the fiscally responsible thing to do. But, as I’ve said before, once our economy begins to recover, we should look to return the public finances to a more sustainable footing.” • This article was amended on 19 January 2021 to clarify the definition of budget deficit to include other receipts."
2021-01-22T10:12:00Z,business,Business,"Britain lost almost 6,000 licensed premises in 2020","Britain lost almost 6,000 licensed premises in 2020, according to fresh data charting the severe toll that Covid-19 is taking on the struggling hospitality sector. Data tracking more than 100,000 venues with a licence to serve alcohol showed a tide of closures as the pandemic took hold, with casual dining venues and community pubs the worst affected.
Of the 10 largest city centres, Birmingham’s hospitality industry suffered the most, losing 8.5% of its bars, pubs and licensed restaurants or hotels. Overall, the number of licensed premises in Great Britain declined by 5.1%, according to the market recovery monitor from the industry analysts CGA and AlixPartners, excluding Northern Ireland. The number of closures, 9,930, was not significantly higher than in 2019, when 8,658 sites shut. But they were not replaced by openings, as the pandemic depressed the number of pubs, bars and restaurants setting up shop from 6,487 and 3,955. Most of those that opened did so in the first quarter, before the pandemic, or in late summer, with new arrivals dwindling towards the end of the year. Casual dining – typically affordable, more laid-back restaurants – was the worst-hit area of hospitality, with a 9.7% decline in the number of venues. Community pubs, which often do not serve meals and had little to gain from the VAT cut on food or the chancellor’s eat out to help out scheme – shrunk by the second largest amount, declining by 5.1%. Urban venues were hit worse than those in the countryside, with Birmingham losing 8.5% of licensed premises, followed by a 5.6% decline in Leeds, with London and Glasgow recording falls of 4.5%. A difficult December, when most establishments lost some or all of their Christmas trade, is likely to continue the trend, according to the British Beer and Pub Association.
“We fear things could actually get much worse before they get better for our pubs and brewers,” said the BBPA chief executive, Emma McClarkin. “Given this latest evidence showing how the Covid crisis and lockdown is ripping pubs away from their communities for good, it is more important than ever that the government backs our local pubs and brewers. “Pubs are the heart of our communities and have a vital role to play in the economic recovery. If they are to survive the current onslaught they face, they need backing from government.” CGA’s hospitality business unit director, Karl Chessell, said: “Consumers are desperate to get back to eating and drinking out. While the easing of supply is not what we would wish to see, it does mean there will be more demand for those businesses still trading. “There are better days to come but the sector will be in survival mode for some time yet.”"
2021-01-22T08:55:15Z,business,Business,UK Christmas retail sales worse than expected,"Retail sales in Britain staged only a weak recovery in December during the key Christmas shopping period to bring to an end the worst year for consumer spending on record, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics said the volume of British retail sales rose by 0.3% between November and December after the relaxation of the second national lockdown in England – far below economists’ forecasts for growth of 1.2% during the pivotal month for retailers.
For the year as a whole, retail sales plunged by 1.9% as the coronavirus pandemic triggered the biggest annual decline on record despite a boom in spending online during lockdown. According to the latest snapshot, spending in clothing stores jumped by 21.5% as consumer spending recovered from a large decline in November, when much of the high street was closed. Retailers reported a boost in sales at the beginning of the month as people shopped for Christmas presents before tougher restrictions were introduced and Boris Johnson’s government made a last-minute decision to scrap Christmas bubble measures for large parts of the country. Despite the sharp rise in spending on fashion over the festive period, food sales shrank by 3.4%, falling back from a strong growth rate of 2.8% in November when supermarkets had benefited from the closure of pubs, restaurants and other non-essential retailers. The figures come at the end of the worst year for retailers on record, with growing numbers of retailers facing financial ruin during the pandemic, leading to widespread store closures and job losses across the country. With fewer opportunities to socialise during the pandemic and many people working from home, clothing sales fared particularly badly, with a record annual fall of more than 25%. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said retailers had not had the festive bounce in trade they had expected and that the new restrictions meant extra government help was needed urgently. “There was no Christmas cheer for retail as the industry found itself in the firing line for last-minute coronavirus restrictions,” she said. “With no end in sight for retailers closed in lockdown, many will struggle to survive under a mounting rent burden, and a return to full business rates in April. The government should urgently announce an extension to the moratorium on aggressive debt enforcement and offer targeted business rates relief to the worst-affected businesses. “Decisive action is needed to save jobs, shops and local communities, with town and city centres looking to be particularly hard hit unless the government acts now.”
Department stores and other shops, which includes jewellers, cosmetics and toy sellers, also reported record annual declines as the pandemic took its toll. However, with lockdown measures restricting spending in pubs and restaurants, and after a wave of stockpiling earlier in the year, food stores bucked the trends with a 4.3% annual growth rate – the highest since 2001. The closure of much of the high street during lockdown and concerns about public health leading many shoppers to stay away from stores last year also fuelled a boom in online sales, with the total value of internet spending up by 46.1% on the year – the highest annual growth rate since 2008. Jonathan Athow, the deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, said: “Some sectors were able to buck the trend in 2020. The increased popularity of click and collect and people buying more items from home led to a strong year for overall internet sales, with record highs for food and household goods sales online.”"
2021-01-22T08:25:03Z,business,Business,John Lewis to repay Â£300m Covid loan two months early,"John Lewis is to repay a £300m government Covid support loan almost two months early, as the retailer upgraded its profit guidance after stronger than expected sales during the crucial festive season. The upgrade means the John Lewis Partnership, which also owns Waitrose, appears to have avoided reporting potentially its first full-year loss since the employee-owned business was set up in 1920. “Despite the headwinds of the last year when John Lewis stores were closed for several months, and future trading volatility, the partnership believes it has sufficient liquidity [to repay the loan early],” the company said. The loan had been due to be repaid to HMRC and the Bank of England by 15 March. The company used the early repayment announcement to, in effect, issue a Christmas trading update, saying that sales in the period, known as the golden quarter because of its impact on retailers’ annual sales, had proved more resilient than had been feared. “Trading during the peak, which includes Black Friday and the Christmas period, held up better than anticipated,” the company said. “As a result, we expect our full-year profits to be ahead of profit guidance provided at our half-year results last September, where we said the most likely outcome would be for a small loss or a small profit for 2020-21.” Despite the early loan repayment, John Lewis has stood firm on its refusal to repay business rates relief, despite a flurry of supermarkets deciding to return £1.8bn in emergency taxpayer support in December after experiencing strong food sales during the pandemic. The owner of Waitrose, which has also had strong food sales, has held on to the money, saying it helped counteract the devastating impact of the coronavirus crisis on its clothing operations. In November, the company announced it would axe 1,500 head office jobs as part of a £300m cost-cutting drive. In September, John Lewis scrapped its annual staff bonus for the first time in 67 years after warning it could be in line to record its first ever annual loss. Last summer, the company said it would not reopen eight John Lewis stores after reassessing its portfolio during the first national lockdown."
2021-01-22T06:01:39Z,business,Business,Low-paid workers in UK more than twice as likely to lose job in pandemic,"The UK’s lowest-paid workers are more than twice as likely to have lost their jobs in the coronavirus pandemic than higher-paid employees, according to a study revealing rising inequality amid the crisis. The Institute for Employment Studies said one in 20 low-paid workers had fallen out of a job in each quarter since the pandemic struck – equivalent to 250,000 workers across Britain – compared with one in 50 of those on higher wages. While employment is plummeting for the low-paid – driven by job cuts in sectors hardest hit by lockdowns such as food services and hospitality – the report found job opportunities were increasing for higher-paid staff, including in the public sector, technology and finance. The study defined low pay as less than £9.50 an hour, and £10.85 an hour in London. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is under pressure to launch a fresh package of financial support for businesses and workers as the UK economy edges closer to a double-dip recession during the third national lockdown in England. The chancellor also faces calls to extend a £20-a-week uplift in the value of universal credit benefits, launched last year and due to expire at the end of March. The latest lockdown measures are expected to result in about two-thirds of low-paid workers – 4 million people – either being away from work, on furlough or working fewer hours than normal, the Institute for Employment Studies said. It said this would be double the rate of work disruption for staff who are not low-paid. Warning that the pandemic would dramatically exacerbate inequalities in the world of work, the report also included interviews with 40 low-paid workers, and found that many were slipping through cracks in the government’s emergency support schemes such as furlough. It said in many cases low-paid workers reported being denied furlough, having their hours cut, being expected to work without adequate protection, and seeing their living costs increase while their incomes fell. Urging the government to take further action to support low-paid workers hit hardest by the pandemic, the institute said maintaining the £20 uplift in universal credit was vital for supporting struggling households, and a temporary suspension of the benefit cap – which limits the amount of government support households can receive – was needed this year. Unemployment is expected to rise dramatically after the furlough scheme expires at the end of April. The report said 2.6 million people were expected to be out of work, up from about 1.3 million before the pandemic struck. The institute said statutory sick pay should be increased to at least £200 a week, more than double the current £95.85. Tony Wilson, the insitute’s director, said: “This [report] shows the unequal nature of the pandemic. With unemployment set to rise sharply this year, we are likely still in the foothills of the employment crisis, but it has already taken a significant toll on low-paid workers. We can take action now and at the budget to address this. Looking further ahead, we need to plan for the recovery and ensure that we put full employment and decent work at the heart of it.”"
2021-01-22T00:01:32Z,business,Business,NS&I boss apologises for customer service amid rise in withdrawals,"The boss of Britain’s state-owned savings bank has apologised for dismal customer service levels following a surge in withdrawals, saying the bank struggled to cope with “unprecedented” demand and a drop in staffing linked to the pandemic. In a letter to MPs on the Treasury committee, National Savings & Investments chief executive Ian Ackerley said the bank was opening four new call centres to help cope with demand, after big cuts in its bond prize payouts and savings rates left customers scrambling to pull their cash. NS&I, which runs a monthly prize draw for premium bond holders, is also pausing a controversial decision to stop sending physical cheques to winners that had caused anxiety for some elderly and vulnerable savers. The move contributed to a 43% jump in complaints in the six months to September. “I am very sorry for those customers who experienced poor service last year and I am determined to return NS&I to delivering the high quality service our customers have been accustomed to for many years now,” Ackerley said. However, the decision has come too late for some savers who pulled £26.5bn from the bank in the final three months of 2020. NS&I warned it was likely to be more than £9.5bn short of its £35bn full-year funding target by March. Conservative MP and Treasury committee chairman Mel Stride said: “The damage that may have been done to NS&I’s reputation over the last few months is worrying. NS&I has a big role to play in helping the government fund the costs of the coronavirus recovery scheme and it will need to work hard to win back customers.” NS&I has been under pressure to raise around £35bn to help support government borrowing during the Covid crisis, up from its previous £6bn target. While it initially attracted savers who had built up nest eggs during lockdown, a cut to payouts sparked a wave of withdrawals. Acklerley said NS&I started to fall behind on calls and withdrawal requests as staff fell ill, were forced to shield or had to take care of family. Meanwhile, its back office sites in India were forced to close at least three times between March and June. “This has had a significant impact on the processing of bereavement claims, general correspondence and complaints,” Ackerley said. NS&I has since brought those operations back to the UK."
2021-01-22T00:01:32Z,business,Business,"Brexit has given competitive edge on car battery tariffs, says Nissan chief","Nissan has said Brexit has given the company an edge, as the Japanese carmaker said it will buy more batteries from within the UK to avoid tariffs. The owner of the UK’s largest car factory, in Sunderland, also said it would push ahead with the production of a new version of its Qashqai SUV this year, after it delayed the new model as the coronavirus pandemic wrought havoc on car sales and production. Ashwani Gupta, Nissan’s chief operating officer, said: “Brexit gives us the competitive advantage not only within the United Kingdom but outside the United Kingdom also.” Speaking from Nissan’s Yokohama headquarters, Gupta said the Brexit deal had turned out to be positive for the carmaker. The advantage comes because it is not reliant on batteries imported from east Asia, unlike many of its rivals. From 2027 all British and European carmakers will have to source batteries from either the UK or EU, as agreed in the Brexit deal, or face tariffs on their exports. The comments mark an abrupt change in tone from Nissan, which along with the rest of the car industry has previously been one of the loudest voices warning against a disruptive Brexit. The former Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn in 2016 said the UK government would have to compensate carmakers for any extra costs caused by the UK’s departure. Nissan eventually secured secret pledges of government aid initially worth £80m, which were later reduced to £61m. The carmaker later made a U-turn on plans to build another SUV, the X-Trail, in north-east England while warning that Brexit uncertainty was harming its business. The Sunderland plant employs about 6,000 people and produced nearly 350,000 cars in 2019, although it has capacity to make 600,000 a year. The carmaker’s European boss later warned that a no-deal Brexit that resulted in tariffs or quotas on exports from the UK would destroy its entire European business model. However, the last-minute Brexit deal agreed on Christmas Eve ensured that most car exports between the UK and the EU will be free of tariffs – border taxes charged on foreign imports – provided that they contain enough parts sourced from either side of the Channel.
Nissan’s comments will likely be seen as a boost for the government at a time when many other manufacturers have complained of extra costs and disruption at ports because of Brexit. The Brexit deal has added new customs paperwork, but Gupta argued the costs were “peanuts” compared with the effects of the Covid pandemic or natural disasters. “For a global manufacturer who is running 150 markets and 14 plants around the world, to have additional documentation, to fill in a form at the border, is nothing,” Gupta said. Much of the extra paperwork relates to the complex rules of origin that govern whether an export is tariff-free or not. Nissan said that all of the cars manufactured in Sunderland contained enough UK or EU content to avoid tariffs, with the exception of the longer-range electric Leaf. That model is dependent on imports of valuable batteries with a capacity of 62 kilowatt-hours [kWh] imported from the US. However, Nissan has agreed a deal with its battery partner, Envision AESC, to produce the 62kWh battery in a plant next-door to Nissan’s factory. The Sunderland battery plant, which currently makes batteries with 40kWh capacity, was owned by Nissan until 2019, and supplies Nissan Sunderland exclusively. The switch of spending from Asia to the UK will probably result in extra jobs in Sunderland, although Gupta said it was not possible to say how many at this stage. He also declined to detail the amount of new investment the plant would require, but said it would be possible to complete it before the end of this year. The Envision plant, whose annual battery output is about 1.9 Gigawatt hours [GWh], is considered to be relatively small compared with other automotive battery factories. Industry insiders do not generally describe it as a “gigafactory” on the scale of those being built in Europe by the likes of the US electric car pioneer Tesla or Northvolt, a Swedish startup, as they race to meet EU targets to build up a European battery industry."
2021-01-21T23:02:36Z,business,Business,JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon is paid $31.5m after decrying income inequality,"Jamie Dimon, the billionaire boss of JP Morgan who has warned income inequality has “bifurcated the economy” in America, was paid $31.5m in 2020, the bank announced on Thursday. The news is likely to cast a harsh spotlight on a figure who has opined about the need for a more caring and equitable capitalism, yet appears to have vastly increased his fortune at a time of immense suffering due to the coronavirus pandemic that has seen millions of people plunged into poverty and homelessness.
JP Morgan paid Dimon a salary of $1.5m, a $5m cash bonus and $25m of restricted stock tied to performance, according to a regulatory filing. The total was the same as last year, even though the bank has enjoyed “stellar” growth in some areas, according to analysts. In 2019 JP Morgan paid Dimon $31.5m, a 1.6% increase from the $31m he received for 2018. His latest pay deal comes after the bank posted better than expected quarterly results last week. JP Morgan enjoyed a record fourth quarter for trading in 2020 which boosted the bank’s revenues to $30.16bn in revenue, exceeding analysts’ estimates. Dimon, who Forbes estimates has a fortune at $1.7bn, is one of a handful of billionaires who have warned that the excesses of capitalism are threatening the foundation of society. In 2019 he told CBS’s 60 Minutes that income inequality is a “huge problem” – but dodged questions about his own salary.
In the same year, launching a $350m program to help underserved communities, Dimon warned income inequality had “bifurcated the economy”. “A big chunk of [people] have been left behind. Forty per cent of Americans make less than $15 an hour. Forty percent of Americans can’t afford a $400 bill, whether it’s medical or fixing their car. Fifteen percent of Americans make minimum wages, 70,000 die from opioids [annually],” said Dimon. But Dimon warned that socialism was not the answer, saying it produces “stagnation, corruption and often worse”. Last year, Dimon joined a glittering array of corporate bosses to tackle racial inequality. Following the police killing of George Floyd the Business Roundtable, the US’s most powerful business lobby and an organization that Dimon used to chair, announced it was forming a committee to tackle inequality. Dimon is thought to harbor political ambitions and was tipped as a possible treasury secretary before the election, a position now almost certain to go to Janet Yellen, the former chair of the Federal Reserve. He once claimed he would have easily beat Donald Trump in an election fight. “I’m smarter than he is,” he said in 2018. “And, by the way, this wealthy New Yorker actually earned his money,” he said. “It wasn’t a gift from Daddy.” But he said the liberal wing of the Democrat party would probably block his chances. Shortly after making the comments Dimon said: “I should not have said it,” adding that the statement “proves I wouldn’t make a good politician”."
2021-01-21T21:24:11Z,business,Business,Next drops bid to buy Topshop after Arcadia's breakup,"Next has pulled out of the race to acquire Topshop, the jewel in the crown of Sir Philip Green’s collapsed fashion empire Arcadia, after rival bidders trumped its offer. Arcadia, which employed 13,000 people across 500 outlets when it fell into administration last year, is being broken up. Interested parties had been asked to submit bids for the whole company or individual brands at the start of this week. Next, which was working with the US hedge fund Davidson Kempner, said it had “withdrawn from the process to acquire any or all of the Arcadia Group from the administrator”. In a statement the FTSE 100 company added “our consortium has been unable to meet the price expectations of the vendor” and wished the future owners well in their endeavours to “preserve an important part of the UK retail sector”. The Next consortium was pitted against Shein, a Chinese online fashion retailer and Authentic Brands, the US owner of the Barneys department store, which has been linked to a joint bid with JD Sports. The online retailers Asos and Boohoo are also thought to be involved in the mix. Shein tabled an offer worth in excess of £300m for Topshop and Topman, according to Sky News which first reported the development. It added that a separate process was being run for other Arcadia brands such as Burton and Dorothy Perkins. Arcadia, which Green bought for £850m in 2002, is home to a stable of household names including Topshop, Topman, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis, Miss Selfridge and Burton. Evans, its plus-size clothing brand, has already been hived off and sold to City Chic Collective, an Australian retailer, for £23m. Arcadia has been the biggest corporate casualty of the pandemic, which has hammered high street retailers. The high street closures proved to be the final straw for the group, which had suffered years of flagging sales amid heavy competition from rivals such as Boohoo and Primark. It only narrowly avoided administration in 2019 after landlords agreed rent reductions and store closures. In the wake of the BHS scandal, which saw Green eventually agreeing to pay £363m into the company’s depleted pension pot, the failure of Arcadia has thrown the spotlight on its own scheme, which has an estimated £350m deficit. The family made a promised £50m payment a year early and has also signed over some Arcadia property assets – but it is not yet clear whether it will be enough to fill the hole."
2021-01-21T19:59:36Z,business,Business,Let's hope Cineworld's shameless bonus scheme proposal flops | Nils Pratley,"You would assume a 20% family shareholding in the company you run would serve as a strong incentive to get out of bed in the morning. Not so, apparently. Mooky and Israel Greidinger, the headline acts at Cineworld, would also like a super-charged bonus scheme to restore the quoted cinema chain’s share price to its pre-pandemic status. The blurb from the boardroom says “it is imperative we retain and motivate our highly regarded leadership team through the next phase of the company’s recovery and beyond”. Are other shareholders meant to believe the brothers, chief executive and deputy, are contemplating a change of career?
Come on, the family’s stake in a business founded 90 years ago is still worth £193m. If the share price, currently 69p, gets back to its February 2020 level of 190p, the value of that holding will increase to £530m. That’s a decent prize. The proposed scheme would see each brother collect shares worth £33m if 190p is achieved within three years. And, in the event of a rocketing overshoot, a cap would be set at £65m. The sums are ridiculous in themselves. The fact that the speed of Cineworld’s recovery depends on national vaccination programmes, and is thus beyond management’s control, merely adds to the silliness. Fund managers must vote down the proposal. If they don’t, every public-company executive in the land will demand a Covid recovery bonus. Covid sparks spread-betting boom The warning on IG Group’s website says 75% of its customers lose money trading its financial spread-betting products. That doesn’t stop anybody having a go, of course, and a pandemic has been beautiful for business – from the provider’s point of view, that is. The number of active clients at IG increased by 55% in the June to November period, an astonishing figure that helped to generate a 129% increase in pre-tax profits to £231m. To think: a few years ago the question was whether the financial spread-betting boom was over. Volatility in share prices, which Covid has provided in spades, usually brings out the punters but there are probably two extra ingredients at work: spare time and spare cash. If you’re in a secure job – and IG says its average client is male, aged between 30 and 50 and earns £65,000 a year – you may have more disposable income than a year ago since you’ve been deprived of foreign holidays and restaurants and so on. Having a leveraged flutter in stock markets fills the space between Zoom meetings, and possibly even during them. The phenomenon seems to be global. IG is predominately a UK business but its update signalled strong growth in its overseas markets, from Australia to Japan. The US is now in view and IG is buying, for $1bn, a retail-focused futures and options operation called Tastytrade. The name is a clue that the online brokerage’s style is more excitable than UK regulators might allow when financial derivatives, which aren’t plain vanilla fare, are offered to the general public. But they do things differently in the US. Tastytrade has gathered 105,000 active accounts from launch in 2017, which definitely demonstrates appetite for trading. What does it all mean? No doubt IG’s clientele are a sophisticated bunch who understand risks. And, if they’ve been on the right side of the volatility in Tesla, Rolls-Royce and Lloyds Banking Group – the three most traded stocks in the last six months – they may even have improved the 75% losing batting average. But remember: a surge in retail investor interest often comes just before markets turn ugly. Non-executive directors are in vogue There’s a mini-trend among FTSE 100 companies, when faced with a sudden or hard-to-fill chief executive vacancy, to haul a non-executive director into frontline service. Jette Nygaard-Andersen at Entain, the Ladbrokes and Coral owner, is the latest appointment. Andy Bird at Pearson, the educational publisher, was another. So, too, Warren East at Rolls-Royce and, in Entain’s sector, Peter Jackson at Flutter, the Paddy Power and Betfair owner. One can see the appeal. A director already on the board knows the company and the strategy, but should also bring experience from elsewhere. In Nygaard-Andersen’s case, her executive years were spent at a Swedish media group specialising in video gaming and esports, territory that the gambling industry now also has its eye on. We’ll have to wait to see if non-executive converts outperform others, but less money spent on headhunters is something."
2021-01-21T19:58:20Z,business,Business,Nissan forced to shut UK production line owing to supply delays,"Nissan has been forced to shut one of the two production lines at its Sunderland factory as it faces supply delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The UK’s biggest car factory has paused production of its Qashqai crossover SUV and its electric Leaf car, with the aim of restarting on Monday. The factory also produces the Juke model. A Nissan spokesman said: “Production on line one at the plant has been paused due to supply chain disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. We anticipate that production will resume on Monday next week.” The temporary shutdown is the latest in a series of issues that have affected carmakers in recent weeks. Before Christmas, companies including Honda and Jaguar Land Rover halted some production, in part because of delays at ports disrupting the import of parts. Shipping companies blamed Brexit stockpiling for adding to delays before the new year, but the last-minute free trade agreement struck on Christmas Eve between the UK and the EU meant the car industry avoided the immediate imposition of tariffs or quotas. Carmakers including Nissan had warned that a no-deal Brexit would have been catastrophic for the industry in the UK.
Carmakers have also had to contend with global shortages of computer chips, causing production shutdowns around the world. Honda’s Swindon plant was among those affected. Nissan’s Sunderland plant, which employs about 6,000 workers, produced 366,000 cars in 2019 but is thought to have the capacity to build as many as 600,000. Production fell sharply during 2020 when Nissan and every other European carmaker closed their doors for months from March as they assessed how to implement safety measures during the pandemic. The factory is not running at the weekends and does not have a third shift running on either line, giving it the scope to increase production."
2021-01-21T19:19:58Z,business,Business,Cineworld faces revolt by shareholders over £208m share scheme,"Britain’s largest cinema chain is facing a shareholder backlash over a scheme that could result in senior bosses being allocated up to £208m in share awards while thousands of staff remain on furlough as all 127 of its UK sites remain closed. Cineworld’s shareholders are due to vote on a new pay policy and long-term incentive plan (LTIP) at a special meeting next week. The shareholder advisory groups Glass Lewis and ISS have recommended that investors vote against the plans. Glass Lewis said the structure of the proposed LTIP, which would deliver a block of shares covering three years, meant executives appeared “eligible to receive virtually unlimited remuneration”. Cineworld’s 5,500 UK staff have been out of work since October, when the company closed all of its sites indefinitely after the announcement that the release of the next James Bond film would be postponed until April. Cineworld staff have been on furlough since November, and there has been a significant round of voluntary and compulsory redundancies at various managerial levels, from supervisors to cinema management. The proposed LTIP will award the company’s senior executives if Cineworld’s share price bounces back to £1.90p within three years. If this level – which is close to its pre-pandemic level of £1.97p – is reached, bosses will share £104m, with the chief executive, Mooky Greidinger, and his brother and deputy, Israel, in line for awards of £33m each. If the share price reaches the upper cap of £3.80, executive directors would between them be awarded shares worth a total of £208m, with the two Greidinger brothers receiving £65m each. “On an annualised basis the maximum payout under the plan reflects about 3,400% of the chief executive’s base salary,” Glass Lewis told investors in a note. “This potential payout is excessive, far outpacing the maximum opportunity available to UK peers.” Cineworld shares are trading at 70p and have never reached a price of £3.80. ISS noted that given the Greidinger family control 20% of Cineworld, there was a question over whether there was “a genuine need to further incentivise” the owners.
The proposed scheme, which will require the support of 50% of Cineworld’s investors to be implemented, pays out in full if there is a change in ownership at the company. In the ISS note, which was first reported by Sky News, the shareholder advisory group said it was also a “matter of exceptionally poor practice in the UK market that awards would automatically vest upon a change of control”. In November Cineworld secured financial lifelines from lenders worth $750m (£560m) to weather the pandemic as long as it can reopen its cinemas by May. Its executive directors voluntarily agreed to defer payment of their salaries and bonuses. “The fact that salaries have been cut and bonuses are not paying out is unlikely to be viewed as a compelling reason for a large block award of this type,” ISS noted. Cineworld declined to comment."
2021-01-21T19:08:27Z,business,Business,France says Eurostar will get French and UK aid to ensure its future,"Eurostar will get help from France and the UK to ensure it survives the pandemic, according to the French government. The cross-Channel rail service has said its future is at risk and appealed for state aid, with passenger numbers down more than 95% on pre-pandemic levels. It now operates just one train a day each way on its London-Paris and London-Brussels routes. The French transport minister, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, told an Assemblée nationale committee on Thursday that the state would “be there at Eurostar’s side to maintain this strategic link between our two countries”. Djebbari said the government was working with the UK on “mechanisms for aid, proportional to everyone’s involvement in Eurostar,” to keep the business going. He said he had been in discussion for several weeks with the British transport secretary, Grant Shapps. The French state-owned railway SNCF owns 55% of Eurostar, and Belgium 5%. Britain sold its 40% stake to private pension funds in 2015. Eurostar is headquartered in the UK and has argued that Britain has come to the aid of the rest of its railway system, spending billions to release train operators – including other foreign state-owned firms – from franchises as revenues have disappeared. It has also pointed out the aid in loans given to aviation, arguing that rail provides the greenest international link to the UK. While Eurostar’s plight has been evident for some time, with shareholders having pumped an extra €200m into the business, it has only recently admitted its survival is in doubt. The chief executive, Jacques Damas, told Agence France-Presse on Monday that “catastrophe is possible”. Further travel restrictions, including the need for pre-departure Covid testing on both sides of the Channel since Monday, could choke passenger numbers even further, Eurostar fears. A spokesperson said the situation “continues to remain critical for us and the need for support is there.” The UK Department for Transport says it has been engaging extensively and regularly with Eurostar since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak and will continue to discuss Eurostar’s financial situation with the French government. No agreement has yet been reached, however. The Commons transport select committee chair, Huw Merriman, called on the UK and France to set out a joint commitment to backing Eurostar. He said the company contributed £800m a year to the UK economy and was a unique connection to mainland Europe: “We simply cannot afford to lose Eurostar to this pandemic,” he said."

2021-01-21T14:41:55Z,business,Business,Former M&S boss Stuart Rose named chair of EG Group,"The billionaire brothers buying Asda have hired the former Marks & Spencer boss Stuart Rose to chair their EG Group business. EG, a chain of 6,000 petrol stations owned by the Blackburn-based Issa brothers and the private equity group TDR, has appointed Lord Rose as non-executive chairman with immediate effect as Zuber and Mohsin Issa prepare to expand with the Asda acquisition. The veteran retailer also chairs the online groceries firm Ocado but is due to stand down in May after more than eight years. The appointment is a boost to EG’s corporate credentials and its expansion ambitions. The Issa brothers are buying Leeds-based Asda, Britain’s third largest supermarket chain, from the US retail group Walmart for £6.8bn, also in tandem with TDR. EG has expanded rapidly in Europe and the US and has more than £7bn of debt. In October the group’s auditors, Deloitte, resigned, sparking concerns about EG’s governance and management. The group, which was founded as Euro Garages 20 years ago by Zuber and Mohsin Issa, and is now 50/50 owned with TDR, also has investments in businesses including David Lloyd Leisure and Stonegate, the UK’s biggest pub owner. EG made sales of more than €20bn (£17.7bn) in 2019 and generated underlying profits of €910m. KPMG took over as auditors when Deloitte stepped aside. The Competition and Market Authority has embarked on a phase 1 investigation into the Asda deal. The regulator is looking at whether the acquisition will lead to a “substantial lessening of competition” in the UK, and must decide by next month whether to step up its investigation. Rose said: “The Issa brothers are great British entrepreneurs of enormous drive, vision and ambition. EG’s board has asked me to develop appropriate governance structures for a business of this scale. The business has exciting development plans and exceptional prospects in the years to come.”
During his 40-year career in retail, Rose worked for Burton Group, Argos, Booker and Arcadia. He was knighted in 2008 for services to the retail industry and corporate social responsibility, and was given a life peerage in 2014. He is a former chairman of the British Fashion Council and of the outreach charity Business in the Community. The Issa brothers said: “We have plans to create significant convenience and food service opportunities for our customers, and Stuart’s retail and consumer experience will provide invaluable insight and support.” EG also has its eyes on Caffè Nero, which appointed KPMG in September to help it negotiate rent cuts with its landlords. However, EG’s bid for the 800-strong coffee shop chain was rejected in November and Caffè Nero filed instead for a company voluntary arrangement, a form of insolvency that allows retailers to cut rents and shut outlets. The CVA was passed with backing from most Caffè Nero landlords, but some were unhappy and filed a legal challenge funded by EG two weeks ago. A court date has not yet been set. The group of landlords contesting the CVA includes Alan Sugar’s commercial property firm Amsprop. As part of Caffè Nero’s financial restructuring, its founder and controlling shareholder, Gerry Ford, has paid £5m into a fund that can be accessed by the firm when it is needed. Under EG’s takeover proposal, landlords would be repaid in full for rent arrears."
2021-01-21T12:57:15Z,business,Business,Wealthy UK flyers opt for private jets to evade Covid lockdowns,"Wealthy flyers in the UK are opting for private jets and charter flights to evade Covid-19 and beat sudden lockdowns, data shows. While the number of commercial flights from the UK has dropped by three-quarters since the start of the pandemic, private flights are down only 42% compared with 2019, according to the aviation consultancy WingX. In August, demand for private jets was back to 93% of normal levels, while scheduled flights were down 65%. Another rebound was seen around Christmas, with private flights operating at around 70% of pre-pandemic levels in December. The relative resilience of the private jet sector – also referred to as “business aviation” – is all the more surprising given that business conferences around the world have been cancelled because of the pandemic. Richard Koe, the managing director of WingX, said business aviation offered “an on-call and convenient means of connectivity, essential as gaps appear in the scheduled networks”. He added that the UK’s private jet business had declined more than those of any other country in Europe.
Analysis of data on private flights leaving the UK in December showed a strong decline in traditional European destinations such as France, Italy or Austria, which are keeping their ski resorts closed this season or opening their slopes for local people only. However, private trips from the UK to sunnier destinations, including the Maldives, the United Arab Emirates and various Caribbean islands, grew in volume compared with December 2019. While corporate travel around the world is largely on hold, private jet operators are reporting an influx of first-time leisure clients hoping to avoid busy terminals and crowded planes. NetJets, an American company that sells fractional ownership in private jets, said leisure travel now accounted for 80% of its flights, up from 60% before the pandemic. Flexjet, also based in the US and offering a fractional ownership model, reported a similar trend. “Personal travel has been the biggest driver of private aviation activity since the beginning of the pandemic,” said Marine Eugène, the company’s European managing director. “We have seen an increased number of first-time flyers, attracted by the fact that private jets limit the opportunities for exposure to the coronavirus.” Some private jet brokers sold more flights in 2020 than in 2019, including the Swiss-based company LunaJets, which closed the year up 15%. Its CEO, Eymeric Segard, said the company had received up to 200 flight requests a day in March as clients hastily returned from abroad or, conversely, escaped lockdown measures in their home countries. Towards the end of the year there was a surge of European, Russian and American clients escaping to destinations such as the Maldives or the Caribbean, Segard said. A short-haul charter flight can cost several times the monthly income of the average UK household. One broker, EvoJets, based in the US, gives an estimated starting price of $6,400 (about £4,700) for a one-way flight from London to Nice. Many operators offer heavily discounted “empty legs” on planes that need to be moved between airports and that would otherwise carry no passengers. A recent industry report from the aviation firm Honeywell Aerospace suggests business jet usage will fully rebound by the middle of 2021. The report found that operators’ five-year purchase plans for new business jets were down less than one percentage point in 2020. A traveller flying alone in the lightest class of private jet is responsible for up to 20 times the carbon emissions of an economy passenger on a commercial flight, Guardian analysis has found."
2021-01-21T10:54:00Z,business,Business,Ladbrokes owner Entain appoints female chief executive,"Entain, the gambling company behind the Ladbrokes and Coral brands, has appointed a female chief executive in a move that raises the number of women leading FTSE 100 businesses to six. The bookmaker has hired one of its non-executive directors, Jette Nygaard-Andersen, to replace Shay Segev, who departed abruptly last week. Segev left to join sports streaming company DAZN as Entain tried to repel a takeover attempt by American casino-owner MGM Resorts. However, Entain appeared this week to have fended off the £8.1bn bid, with the US giant dropping its interest ahead of a deadline to make a formal offer. One of Nygaard-Andersen’s main focuses will be the US expansion of Entain, known as GVC Holdings until a name change last month. The relaxation of betting restrictions by the US supreme court has triggered a dash to corner the potentially lucrative market, where Entain and MGM already run a joint venture. Nygaard-Andersen, a Danish national, joined the Entain board as an independent non-executive director in 2019. She has previously chaired Danish e-sports team owner Astralis, and had senior executive roles at Modern Times Group, a Swedish media firm that also has e-sports interests. She said: “I am very excited to have the opportunity of continuing the extraordinary momentum that Entain has in its existing markets, as well as helping it enter new regulated markets and reach new audiences.” She also said she was committed to “industry-leading levels of player protection”. Betting companies including Entain’s Ladbrokes Coral brand have faced persistent criticism that their businesses fuel gambling addiction. Barry Gibson, Entain’s chairman, said Nygaard-Andersen was an “outstanding candidate and ready-made CEO”. The other women serving as chief executive of FTSE 100 companies are: Emma Walmsley at GlaxoSmithKline; Liv Garfield at Severn Trent; Alison Brittain at Whitbread; Alison Rose at NatWest Group – the former Royal Bank of Scotland boss; and Milena Mondini de Focatiis, who took over at insurer Admiral at the start of the year. ITV is led by Carolyn McCall, but the broadcaster dropped out of the FTSE 100 index in the summer after the pandemic hit advertising revenues.
Nygaard-Andersen will take over after a uniquely turbulent year in which the bookmaker has had to reorient its business away from betting shops, which have been closed under coronavirus pandemic regulations for large periods since March, and towards online gambling. Entain on Thursday also announced its trading results for the last three months of 2020, with total revenues up by 7% compared with the same period in 2019, despite the closure of most shops, including the UK. Online revenues boomed by 41% year-on-year during the quarter. Over the course of 2020 Entain’s revenues were flat compared with the previous year, and the company expects to make between £825m and £845m for the year, according to one measure of profitability. Revenues from the MGM joint venture more than doubled in 2020."
2021-01-21T10:43:33Z,business,Business,Metallica and Michael Bublé producer cashes in on music streaming rights boom,"The producer of songs by Metallica and Michael Bublé has sold his rights to investors in the latest in a flurry of back-catalogue sales by artists and other rights owners looking to cash in on the music streaming boom. Bob Rock has sold his producer’s rights in heavy metal band Metallica’s eponymous album and songs by Canadian singer Michael Bublé that include Call Me Irresponsible, Crazy Love, and Christmas. The deal, for an undisclosed amount, gives investment firm Hipgnosis Songs Fund rights to 43 songs. The buyer is among a small number of companies snapping up the rights to classic tracks. The advent of music streaming and easily edited social media videos has reinvigorated listener numbers for some classics, and the revenues attached to them. For instance, Fleetwood Mac’s Dreams returned to the charts last autumn 43 years after it was first released after a video of a skateboarder lip-syncing the lyrics went viral.
Hipgnosis was founded in 2018 by Merck Mercuriadis, who has previously managed artists including Elton John, Guns N’ Roses and Beyoncé. The company floated on the London Stock Exchange that year, raising more than £1bn, and has since bought rights to songs from artists including Eurythmics co-founder Dave Stewart and Barry Manilow. It became a member of the mid-cap FTSE 250 investment index in March 2020.
Hipgnosis has this year already announced deals with Shakira and Neil Young, while competitor BMG bought rights from Mick Fleetwood, of Fleetwood Mac. Rock said: “I put my heart and soul into these recordings. I know how much Merck loves music, so it was an easy deal to put together.” Mercuriadis said: “The breadth of Bob Rock’s enormous successes are almost impossible to match by any creator in the history of music. From Metallica’s most famous Black Album to Michael Bublé’s Christmas, he has produced some of the biggest albums of all time that continue to be evergreen, year in and year out.”"
2021-01-21T06:00:23Z,business,Business,Sky aims for one in five staff from minority backgrounds by 2025,"Sky has pledged that one in five of its staff will be from a minority ethnic background by 2025, under a new recruitment target that could lead to 1,500 more black, Asian and minority ethnic workers being hired. The broadcaster will guarantee that at least 5% of employees are black, almost double the current number, as it moves to reshape its 25,000-strong workforce in the UK and Ireland, partly in response to the Black Lives Matter movement. The move is broadly in line with predictions that a fifth of Britons will be from minority ethnic backgrounds by 2031, and follows research that found Sky’s workforce was not representative of the areas where it operates, including around its west London HQ where 48% of the population is BAME. The targets echo those set by several banks, accountants and the civil service. At the BBC, where 15% of staff are BAME, shortlists for the highest-paid jobs must now include at least one minority ethnic candidate. This month the comedian and actor Lenny Henry argued that unless British broadcasters improve on diversity on both sides of the camera, “they run the risk of losing large parts of their audience forever”. If delivered, the transformation will be most marked among Sky’s 300 senior managers, only three of whom are black, including the new chief talent, diversity and inclusion officer, Denise Peart. A quarter of the broadcaster’s on-screen talent and 17% of its comedy and drama writers are from minority ethnic backgrounds, while the proportion in senior production roles is 10%. “Introducing these targets acknowledges that we have more work to do in ensuring our black, Asian and minority ethnic colleagues are fairly represented at all levels,” said Peart. “Our focus will be on making systemic changes to ensure that we recruit, retain, develop and progress these colleagues, whilst holding ourselves accountable for meeting these targets.” Lloyds is aiming for one in 10 of staff to be BAME, which is below the national figure of 14% of the population, Natwest wants to boost the proportion of staff in senior roles who are black from 1% to 3%, close to the national proportion, and Ernst and Young is aiming for 20% of its partners to be BAME by 2025. The UK government is aiming for 13.2% of new recruits to the senior civil service to be from a minority ethnic background by 2025, up from 5.6% in recent years. Sandra Kerr, the race equality director of Business in the Community, said her organisation’s research had shown that BAME workers voiced higher levels of ambition to be promoted and to be fast-tracked than white counterparts and were more likely to have higher education qualifications. She said tackling race disparity in workforces boosted the economy, increased productivity and, in senior teams, improved decision-making by introducing more challenge to accepted norms. “The killing of George Floyd has turbo-charged people,” she said. “It really made employers ask where the black people are around their tables. What a waste of talent. We need it more than ever if we are going to build back better.” Karan Bilimoria, the president of the Confederation of British Industry, said: “Concerted company efforts to accelerate greater racial and ethnic participation – particularly at senior levels – are much needed across British business. What gets measured gets done. Setting stretching targets, as Sky have, alongside more measures to cultivate an inclusive company culture, will undoubtedly propel their progress forward faster.”"
2021-01-21T02:45:31Z,business,Business,Fall in unemployment raises likelihood Australian government will withdraw Covid support,"Unemployment in Australia has fallen by 0.2% to 6.6%, a quicker than expected recovery that increases the likelihood economic supports will be withdrawn. The addition of 50,000 jobs and 2m more hours worked in the month of December also drove the underemployment rate down to 8.5%, a further sign Australia’s economy has returned to growth despite the impact of the coronavirus. After the release of the labour force statistics on Thursday, analysts suggested the Reserve Bank was likely to stop pumping money into the economy by buying government bonds and Scott Morrison warned that taxpayers’ money “can’t be used endlessly to run the Australian economy”.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics found an extra 35,700 full-time and 14,300 part-time jobs were created in December, helping to drive down unemployment despite a 0.1% lift in the participation rate to 66.2%. Nevertheless, over the year to December 2020 employment decreased by 0.5% or 63,900 people, indicating the economy had still not fully recovered from the impact of the coronavirus, including closure of international borders and widespread economic shutdowns in the first half of 2020. Queensland led the recovery with a 1.4% increase in employment, followed by the Northern Territory (up 0.7%) and Victoria (0.4%), which emerged in November from its lockdown to combat the second coronavirus wave. With the jobkeeper wage subsidy set to expire at the end of March, industries still hard hit by the coronavirus recession including tourism and hospitality have ramped up lobbying efforts for sector-specific relief packages. The Tourism and Transport forum has released economic modelling claiming that the latest Covid-19 outbreaks and state border closures will reduce domestic tourism spending by $6.8bn from 24 December to 31 January. The modelling by tourism economists Stafford Strategy warned if jobkeeper was not extended the tourism industry could lose 320,000 jobs by September 2021 due to the lack of international visitors and ongoing uncertainty over domestic borders. Morrison told reporters in Gladstone “of course” the disruption of domestic tourism had “had that cost” and it was “fair and right” of the sector to draw attention to it. But he warned the impact of a repeat of the Victorian second coronavirus wave “would have been far worse, so there are two sides to that coin”. Morrison said the government had sought to provide “as much certainty as possible about what the support arrangements are” but businesses would have to make tough choices because it was “not sustainable” to continue to use debt to prop up the economy. Asked if the government would introduce sector-specific support, Morrison replied: “At this stage the settings are as I’ve set them out and people should work on the basis of those settings unless they’re reviewed.” Labor’s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said jobkeeper should be “tailored and responsive” to local economies to avoid “catastrophic consequences that many are predicting”. In Cairns, he called on the government to devise a new turnover test to allow businesses that are still hard hit to continue to receive the wage subsidy – citing businesses in the tourism-dependent region that are still suffering revenue losses of 70%. Earlier, Morrison told 4RO radio that critics had predicted big job losses after the rate of jobkeeper was reduced in September and December, but instead 450,000 businesses and 2m workers had graduated off the payments. In addition to sector-specific support, the government was yet to decide whether to continue the coronavirus supplement on jobseeker unemployment benefits, permanently increase the jobseeker rate, or allow it to fall to $40 a day. That rate is opposed by economists, the welfare sector and business groups – although some in the government argue higher rates could disincentivise work.
In a statement, Capital Economics said the fact unemployment was now at its lowest rate since April 2020 meant the RBA was likely to end asset purchases in April 2021. “Given that the RBA had expected the unemployment rate to rise to a new peak of 8% in [the fourth quarter] of 2020, the actual outturns clearly represent an upside surprise,” it said. Capital predicted a further decline in unemployment because “job vacancies have continued to rise suggesting the labour demand from businesses remains high”. The Australia Institute’s Matt Grudnoff warned that with “thousands of Australians being supported by jobkeeper in roles that may not continue beyond March, the headline unemployment rate doesn’t tell the whole story”. The senior economist of the progressive thinktank cited the underutilisation rate of 15.1%. “While a modest fall in unemployment is welcome, there is still a long way to go before we see a return to situation normal,” he said."
2021-01-21T00:01:16Z,business,Business,Unilever to tackle advertising stereotypes in diversity drive,"Unilever has said it will tackle advertising stereotypes and work with more businesses run by women and other under-represented groups as part of a wider inclusivity drive. The FTSE 100 company, which is behind household names such as Dove soap, Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream and Marmite, said it planned to use the might of its brands, coupled with its advertising spending power as one of the world’s biggest to make a difference. Dave Ingram, its chief procurement officer, said Unilever had set a target of spending €2bn (£1.8bn) a year with companies owned and managed by women, under-represented minority ethnic groups, people with disabilities and the LGBTQI+ community by 2025. That figure compares with €300m today, Ingram said. Theinitiative is backed up by a development fund to help entrepreneurs finding their feet. Unilever will also increase the number of advertisements that feature or are created by people from diverse groups. The move would “help tackle the prevalence of stereotypes that are often perpetuated through advertising, and promote a more inclusive representation of people”, it said. The pandemic has had a dramatic effect on the world of work, with the £115bn company – the second most valuable business on the London Stock Exchange – looking to develop new employment models. Alan Jope, Unilever’s chief executive, recently announced that the company’s office workers would never return to their desks five days a week. While in New Zealand its staff are trialling a four-day week after a number of smaller firms found it helped productivity and employees’ wellbeing.
The new employment ideas include flexible contracts with benefits, such as pension plans, and giving staff time off work to study. It hopes the approach will foster openness and adaptability, and also resilience, in its workforce. “We’re finding that younger people want flexibility,” said Ingram. “They don’t want to sit in an office five days a week and want different ways of being involved in teams. One of the fundamental elements of the new employment model is how do we have a less of a traditional organisational approach to work.” Unilever has also set a target of only working with businesses that pay employees at least a living wage or income by the end of the decade. Hitting this ambitious target would involve working with farmers, suppliers, NGOs and governments to bring about systemic change."
2021-01-20T20:00:45Z,business,Business,JD Wetherspoon doesn't need any more beer money from Sunak | Nils Pratley,"JD Wetherspoon’s pubs are shut, so one doubts the chairman, Tim Martin, is any less grumpy than usual. He should, though, view his pint as half full. The stock market clearly buys his thesis that conditions are ripe for big players, including Wetherspoon, to prosper by snapping up boozers at knock-down prices. Look at the response to the company’s latest £93.7m fundraising. You might have assumed that a second pandemic equity placing, plus confirmation that cash is still being burned at a rate of £4m a week, would depress shareholders. Far from it. The shares rose 5% to £12.44, continuing their steady recovery from lows of 600p last March. Suddenly Wetherspoon’s pre-pandemic share price of £15 doesn’t look far away. Mitchells & Butlers, still working on its rights issue plan, rose 9% in sympathy. “Additional capital will facilitate the acquisition of new properties, which are likely to be available at favourable prices, as a result of the pandemic,” said Wetherspoon in its pitch. “It may be possible to achieve a higher-than-average return on capital on properties acquired in the next few years, based on the company’s past experience.” Yes, it’s a fair bet that pub-land’s big players will emerge into a vaccinated, socially undistanced world with their competitive positions enhanced. Smaller unquoted rivals tend not to have the same easy access to capital. Some stragglers won’t make it. Others may be so shaken they’ll be desperate to sell their freeholds, even at sub-2019 prices. Licensing authorities, contemplating vacant high-street shops, may be more inclined to approve conversions into pubs. The same thought seems to have occurred to the former Greene King boss Rooney Anand who was reported by Sky News this week to be raising £200m of US private equity money for a spot of bargain hunting in the UK pubs sector. It looks a buyer’s market. This hardly feels fair, of course. At one end of the industry, a chunk of smaller pubs are “hanging by a thread” and awaiting meagre grants just to survive, according to the British Beer & Pub Association. At the other end, war chests are being assembled to capitalise on the likelihood that some threads will break. All operators have been recipients of government support in the form of furlough payments, VAT holiday and business rates, of course. But one can understand why the Treasury is hesitating about confirming an extension for everyone. If the stock market signals are correct, the national chains don’t need more beer money from the public purse.
Pulled IPO suggests more to the Jack Ma Beijing story Jack Ma is back and, to nobody’s surprise, the theme of the Chinese billionaire’s video wasn’t another analysis of the failings of the country’s banking regulators and their “pawnshop mentality”. Instead, the co-founder of Alibaba, who had not been seen in public since those same regulators halted the flotation of payments spinoff Ant Group, proclaimed his devotion to the cause of Chinese rural education. Very bland, very diplomatic. What does the whole saga mean for Alibaba, Ant and the general freedom of manoeuvre for China’s tech titans? James Anderson, the co-manager of FTSE 100 investment trust Scottish Mortgage, which has enjoyed huge success by backing high-flying Chinese tech firms including Alibaba, attempted to answer that one last week. “What we think is happening is that China is moving principally to a policy of greater antitrust requirements in a way that, actually, I think, would have been beneficial in America and Europe,” he said. He may be right that a rough-and-ready process of competition policy is at work in China (and, note, he wasn’t excusing the political system). Viewed that way, Ma has merely been reminded who is boss. And Alibaba, the dominant online platform, has simply had its wings clipped in a way that Facebook, say, has never seriously faced in the west. That could indeed be viewed as pro-competition. But there is still an unexplained part. Ant Group’s $37bn (£27bn) flotation would have been the world’s biggest fundraising. It was meant to be a showpiece event, not just for Ma’s empire but for China’s stock market. Yet it was cancelled at the 11th hour, seemingly because of a single speech. That detail smacked of panic. There’s more to come on this tale, one suspects."
2021-01-20T18:24:19Z,business,Business,Saga requires all cruise passengers to have coronavirus vaccine,"Saga has become the first UK tour operator to tell cruise and holiday customers that they must be vaccinated to travel with them this summer. The over-50s travel firm, which has reported a surge in bookings since the vaccination programme was announced, is taking reservations on condition that customers are fully inoculated, with two shots where necessary, at least 14 days before departure. Passengers will also need to take a Covid test at the departure terminal. Saga has deferred the start date for its entire holiday programme of hotel stays, escorted tours and cruises until 1 May, with the first sea cruise departing on 4 May, which the company said should be ample time for its customers to receive their jabs. The firm implemented the rules after polling 2,000 of its customers, with an overwhelming majority in favour of allowing only vaccinated passengers to travel. A spokesperson said: “The health and safety of our customers has always been our number one priority at Saga, so we have taken the decision to require everyone travelling with us to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19. “Our customers want the reassurance of the vaccine and to know others travelling with them will be vaccinated too.” The rival UK cruise lines P&O and Cunard have not implemented the policy, with the first P&O cruise since the pandemic began scheduled to depart in April, after repeated postponements. A P&O spokesman said only that the new vaccines “were expected be an important boost for cruising … in the days ahead”. The cruise industry was at the forefront of the pandemic, with mass outbreaks onboard ships before coronavirus restrictions became commonplace in Europe and the US. One P&O ship, the Ruby Princess, which docked in Sydney with at least 900 customers who later tested positive, became a significant source of cases in Australia.
Saga said the vaccine rule would be in addition to a number of measures to ensure safety on its cruises, including pre-departure testing, reducing the maximum number of passengers, enhanced cleaning, and more medical facilities and staff. The travel association Abta said it was not yet aware of any other holiday firms planning to follow suit. The policy comes as the global airline body Iata called on EU governments to create internationally recognised certificates to allow those vaccinated to travel freely. Iata’s director general, Alexandre de Juniac, told the tourism body UNWTO on Tuesday: “For travel and tourism, testing is the immediate solution to reopen borders. And eventually that will transition to vaccine requirements.”"
2021-01-20T16:30:09Z,business,Business,"Don't read too much into the fall in Australia's payroll jobs, at least not yet | Greg Jericho","The latest release of the payroll jobs index showing a 6% fall in jobs in the past month might suggest that unemployment is about to rise. But closer inspection reveals that despite the usual drop in work in January, employment overall is holding up well. However, full-time work still has a way to go. Since the pandemic, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has, in association with the ATO, begun releasing a weekly payroll job index that has provided some more current insight into how jobs are going than we get from the monthly labour force figures. And so it might be worrying to find that payroll jobs have dropped by almost as much from the start of December to the beginning of January as occurred when the pandemic hit last March:
This is especially so when you consider that the monthly employment figures have tracked pretty well with the payroll job index:
But does this mean that employment is about to take a massive hit and unemployment will again rise? Probably not. The reason is that the payroll job numbers are unadjusted, whereas the unemployment rate and employment figures you hear talked about each month (and will again tomorrow, when the December figures come out) are “seasonally adjusted”.
This is because every year things occur in some months that really have no bearing on the strength of the labour market or the economy. Every January, for example, regardless of what happened in December, people lose their jobs. This is because December, regardless of what happened in November, is a big job-hiring month, but many of those jobs (because of Christmas and the summer holidays) are temporary. And so every year in January a lot of people stop working:
So what the ABS does is calculate a “seasonally adjusted” measure, which takes into account what usually occurs in each month. The difference is so great that in January last year the ABS estimated there were 158,000 more people employed in “seasonally adjusted” terms than in the “original” unadjusted data:
Neither number is “right” or “wrong”, it is just that the seasonally adjusted figure provides necessary context and so everyone except economists and statisticians ignores the original data. But because the payroll jobs index is unadjusted, it has shown that usual big drop in jobs in January. At least it is not due to Victoria, which saw a similar fall in payroll jobs as every other state:
But if we compare this January’s figures with last year’s it can at least give us some idea of how we are going. Across the states, South Australia and Western Australia are doing the best and Tasmania and Victoria are doing the worst:
Interestingly, women are doing better overall than men, but again some care needs to be taken with this as the numbers don’t precisely match up because the ABS does not have precise data for the gender of all payroll job holders (but it does for “people”). But, that aside, it does appear that women have come out of the pandemic with more work relative to where they were this time last year compared with men. The growth of work across ages also shows that those over 60 have suffered the most:
It also suggests that those in their 20s are mostly doing better than older workers – perhaps as a result of the government’s jobmaker hiring credit for workers under 35. But that 6.7% fewer men and 5.8% fewer women in their 60s are working in jobs now compared with a year ago suggests that the pandemic recession, like most recessions before it, has been particularly brutal for those nearing retirement. It has also been brutal for those working in hospitality – payroll jobs in accommodation and food services are down 11.4% compared with last year, while jobs in education and public administration are well up:
But, again, this is where some care needs to be taken. These figures would suggest construction work is doing worse compared with last year than is the arts and recreation industry. That might be the case but, given the ongoing impact of the pandemic on the arts sector and the usual lack of construction work in January, it is best to wait before making any grandiose statements. It highlights that while the payroll job numbers provide some insight into how things are travelling, they have a few holes in them. Most importantly they don’t tell us whether these jobs are full or part-time. And we know that part-time work has surged in the last half of 2020, while 1.7% fewer people are employed full-time than were before the pandemic hit:
And so, while the payroll job figures are not as bad as they first appear, the concern about how employment will look after this pandemic remains unclear and will until we get more data with greater context."

2021-01-20T13:45:42Z,business,Business,Chinese billionaire Jack Ma makes first public appearance in months,"The Chinese billionaire Jack Ma has made his first public appearance since Beijing began a crackdown on his business empire. Ma, a celebrity businessman and one of the richest people in China, had not spoken publicly since regulators blocked the flotation of Ant Group, the financial payment company he controls. His absence had fuelled speculation that he may have fled China. On Wednesday, Ma, a former English teacher, participated in an online ceremony for 100 rural teachers and was shown in a video touring a primary school in his home town of Hangzhou.
According to a report by the Tianmu News, a news service run by the official Zhejiang Daily Group, Ma said in the video: “My colleagues and I have been studying and thinking, and we have become more determined to devote ourselves to education and public welfare. “Working hard for rural revitalisation and common prosperity is the responsibility for our generation of businessmen.” It was Ma’s first public appearance since 24 October, when he accused China’s financial regulators and state-owned banks of operating a “pawnshop” mentality at a high-profile summit in Shanghai. That set him on a collision course with officials and led to the suspension of a $37bn (£27bn) initial public offering (IPO) for Ant Group, which is an affiliate of Ma’s e-commerce giant Alibaba. Authorities in Beijing also ordered an investigation into allegations of “monopolistic practices” at Alibaba and later ordered Ant Group to scale back its operations. Shares in Alibaba, that had tumbled after the Chinese regulators’ actions, rose by 8.5% on Wednesday on the back of reports of Ma’s reappearance. Ant Group confirmed the authenticity of the video, but declined to comment further. Steven Leung, the sales director at the brokerage firm UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong, said: “Jack Ma’s reappearance has given investors peace of mind after a lot of rumours, allowing them to pile into the stock which had been a laggard in the market.” Brock Silvers, a managing director at the private equity fund Kaiyuan Capital in Hong Kong, said: “Jack Ma’s unexpected reemergence, just as sudden as his earlier disappearance, is likely a sign that his relationship with Beijing’s regulatory authorities has stabilised.” Speculation about the 56-year-old’s whereabouts had escalated in recent weeks when he was abruptly replaced as a judge on TV talent show Africa’s Business Heroes, and he was cut out of promotional videos for the programme. Ma, previously China’s richest person, has seen his fortune drop from an estimated $61bn before his October speech to about $53bn, according to Bloomberg’s billionaires index. The wealthiest person in China is Pony Ma (no relation), the chair and chief executive officer of rival tech firm Tencent. On Christmas Eve, China’s state market supervision administration said it had ordered an investigation into Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd over “suspected monopolistic practices”. An editorial in the state mouthpiece People’s Daily said efforts to prevent monopoly and anti-competitive practices were “requirements for improving the socialist market economy system and promoting high-quality development. “This investigation does not mean that the country’s attitude towards the encouragement and support of the platform economy has changed.”
Analysts and policy experts said Beijing’s action against Ma’s companies was likely to have been sparked by the speech he gave to the Bund summit in Shanghai on 24 October, during which he criticised overbearing regulation and the state dominance of banking. “We shouldn’t use the way to manage a train station to regulate an airport,” Ma said, according to a transcript. “We cannot regulate the future with yesterday’s means.” “It is impossible for the pawnshop mentality to support the financial demand of global development over the next 30 years,” said Ma, who started Alibaba in a one-bedroom flat in China 21 years ago. “We must leverage our technological capabilities today and build a credit system based on big data, to get rid of the pawnshop mentality.” Ma was speaking alongside senior officials such as Wang Qishan, a former security tsar and the Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s right-hand man; Yi Gang, the governor of China’s central bank; and Zou Jiayi, a vice-minister at the ministry of finance. Ma’s comments went viral on Chinese social media and were seen as a direct attack on government officials."
2021-01-20T09:43:53Z,business,Business,Burberry's European sales slump but Marcus Rashford ads widen appeal,"Burberry has reported a near 40% drop in sales in European markets on the back of store closures and fewer tourists but is experiencing a strong rebound in other parts of the world. Sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa slumped 37% in 13 weeks to 26 December, a major contrast with the Asia Pacific region, where sales jumped 11% on strong demand from Chinese and Korean shoppers.
With 15% of its stores closed and about a third operating under reduced trading hours or restrictions, Marco Gobbetti, Burberry’s chief executive, said the British luxury brand faced an “uncertain trajectory, given the spread of the more transmissible new variants of Covid-19”. He said: “Given this outlook, we expect trading will remain susceptible to regional disruptions as we close the financial year.” However, Gobbetti struck a positive note on the new future as new collections, and advertising featuring people such as the Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford, attracted younger customers to its designer clothes and accessories. Shoppers were embracing the designs of its creative boss Riccardo Tisci with sales of leather handbags and outerwear up in the “low teens”. Gobbetti said: “While the short-term outlook remains uncertain due to Covid-19, we are well placed to accelerate when the pandemic eases.”
Burberry is working through the implications of the Brexit deal. Based on its preliminary analysis, the company expects a “modest increase in border trade compliance costs as well as some incremental duty under the rules of origin”. Third-quarter sales in established stores were down 9% overall, with the figure pulled down by the company’s decision to reduce the volume of end-of-season discounts, as well as reduced tourist numbers. Online sales were up by more than 50% in the company’s third quarter and by more than 100% in mainland China."
2021-01-20T09:33:14Z,business,Business,Dixons Carphone has bumper Christmas as online revenues soar,"Locked-down European consumers bought big-screen TVs, food preparation gadgets and health and beauty appliances, handing Dixons Carphone’s 11% more revenue from selling electrical items over the Christmas trading period than a year earlier. The retailer, which owns the Currys PC World brand, said computing and gaming products were also big sellers during the festive period and online sales had grown by more than 120%. Internet sales growth was highest in the group’s Greek business, where it soared 366%. In the UK, Dixons Carphone has not been classed as an essential retailer, meaning that its stores have been closed during lockdowns. But Alex Baldock, its chief executive, hailed the company’s increase in online sales. “We’re winning online, where we’re the biggest and fastest-growing specialist technology retailer in all our markets. And even where stores have been closed, our work to bring the best of digital and physical shopping to every customer has borne fruit in such innovations as our one-hour drive-thru order and collect and ShopLive,” Baldock said. The retailer said its revenue from mobile phone sales dropped by 40% in the UK and Ireland during the period, although it said this was as expected, following its decision last April to close all 531 standalone Carphone Warehouse stores, with the loss of 2,900 jobs. The company said it would launch a new mobile offer this year.
Dixons Carphone estimated in December the cost of Covid-related disruption, including store closures and extra spending on safety measures, to be £155m. However, the company said at the time the negative impact had been reduced to £10m by government support. Unlike the nation’s biggest supermarkets, Dixons Carphone has said it has no plans to pay back the business rates relief it has received, which was worth £34m up to the end of October. This is despite the company having reported a profit before interest and tax of £95m in the six months to the end of October."
2021-01-20T08:31:35Z,business,Business,UK inflation jumped in December as shoppers returned to high street,"The annual rate of inflation rose to 0.6% in December from 0.3% in the previous month as shoppers returned to the high street in most parts of the UK after the end of the second lockdown. The Office for National Statistics said an increase in transport costs and a rise in computer games console prices as Christmas approached was only partially offset by cheaper takeaway food and lower furniture and household equipment prices.
With the economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic and most consumers restricted by the government’s regional tiers, the relatively weak rise in prices as the festive period approached was in line with City analyst expectations of a 0.5% increase. The Consumer Prices Index grew by 0.3% month on month after a 0.1% fall in November. Analysts said the stable inflation situation, which has resulted in prices during the pandemic moving up and down within a tight band, was likely to end in 2021 once the recovery gathered momentum and the demand for goods outstripped supply. They believe some of the likely price rises will result from restrictions on imports following the UK’s departure from the EU but that most of the pressure on prices would come from an increase in global demand exceeding supply. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, the chief economist at the money broker Equals, said: “Both Brexit and Covid-19 are factors that have caused substantial pain for businesses and their supply chains. “Rising prices as demand works against supply constraints is already being seen in certain imports courtesy of the goods themselves and the shipping containers that they travel round the world in. “We expect these increases will begin to be seen in the next couple of months as cash-strapped businesses with little margin to play with have to raise prices on customers.”
Last month the ONS said steep discounting by clothing retailers was the main factor in helping reduce inflation to 0.3% in November from 0.7% a month earlier. Last week, official figures showed the economy shrank by 2.6% month on month in November. This slump followed the government’s closure of non-essential shops and the hospitality sector in England to combat the rapid growth in Covid infections, and as tougher controls in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland weighed on growth. A similar contraction is expected when figures appear for January to reflect the impact of the third lockdown, the shutdown of high streets and consequent fall in consumer spending."
2021-01-20T00:26:26Z,business,Business,BHP cuts Mount Arthur coalmine valuation by $1.5bn after thermal coal price plunges,"BHP will slash its valuation of its Mount Arthur coalmine in New South Wales by at least $1.5bn after a dramatic fall in the price of thermal coal, which is burned to produce electricity. The move will wipe out most of the book value of the Hunter Valley mine, leaving it worth between $325m and $455m, BHP said in a quarterly update on Wednesday. BHP said it was selling thermal coal for US$44.35 a tonne in the second half of last year, down 24% on the same period in the previous year.
This is well below the cost of mining the ore of between US$55 and US$59 a tonne, estimated by the mining group in its most recent annual report. BHP has been trying to reduce costs at the mine and put it up for sale amid a ban on Australian coal exports to China and a gloomy long-term outlook for the entire sector. On Wednesday it said it would cut the book value of the mine by between US$1.15bn (about $1.5bn) and US$1.25bn (about $1.6bn), leaving it worth between US$250m ($325m) and US$350m ($455m). The company said the writedown “reflects current market conditions for Australian thermal coal, the strengthening Australian dollar, changes to the mine plan and updated assessment of the likelihood of recovering tax losses”. Mining at Mount Arthur has also become more difficult because the coal seam descends quickly into the earth, requiring more soil to be removed above it. BHP has responded by trying to mine only the highest quality parts of the seam, as well as trying to reduce production costs. BHP will release a final writedown figure in its half year results, due next month. The company announced Mount Arthur was for sale in August last year as part of a plan to get out of thermal coal production. It expects the sale process to take up to two years. In addition to the Mount Arthur mine, BHP owns a third of the Cerrejón mine in Columbia and 80% of BHP Mitsui Coal, a joint venture with Mitsui that mines coking and thermal coal in Queensland. Under pressure from investors, the company in September pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% over the next decade, but stopped short of committing to getting out of coal and gas.
It intends to retain mines producing metallurgical coal, which is used in steel-making, and keep its oil and gas fields. BHP predicts demand for steel will almost double if the world is able to keep global heating to below 1.5C. It produced 6% more iron ore in the second half of last year than in the same period the previous year and the price rocketed by a third over the same time period, driven in part by a construction boom in China as the country recovers from a coronavirus-inspired economic slump. Over the same period thermal coal production plummeted by 30% due to reduced capacity at the port in Newcastle and a 91-day strike at Cerrejón, BHP said."
2021-01-19T20:04:19Z,business,Business,Entain plays a strong hand in a show of far-sightedness,"Aren’t Las Vegas casinos meant to be tough operators who don’t take no for an answer? It turns out that MGM Resorts doesn’t fit the caricature. Entain, owner of Ladbrokes and Coral, rejected MGM’s £8bn takeover offer a fortnight ago and blunt refusal has done the job. The US firm has walked away, muttering about “discipline” in bidding, which is usually shorthand for not being able to afford what you want. This turn of events is surprising, but not wildly so. Entain’s hand in this negotiation – or non-negotiation – was always decent. For starters, the board had the backing of its major shareholders in rejecting MGM’s all-share offer. There was even macho talk among investors about the US firm being a 20th century land-based Luddite desperately seeking Entain’s whizzy online gambling technology. The chat was slightly over-the-top because Entain also comes with 3,000 old-school high street bookies in the UK, but MGM’s lack of tech expertise is real. It is a product of historically tight US gambling legislation that required punters to go in person to places such as Vegas to be fleeced. It is why, when the US started to liberalise its rules a few years ago, MGM recruited Entain for a 50/50 joint venture in the US, called BetMGM. MGM clearly wanted control of the US venture but its other problem was that it was already pushing the limits of affordability. At £13.83 a share, the all-share proposal would have seen Entain’s shareholders emerge with 41.5% of an enlarged MGM. If the terms had been improved – and some Entain shareholders wanted a lot more – the deal would start to look more like a merger than a takeover. The two sides will now have to bury any acrimony and concentrate on making a success of the US joint venture. If analysts’ projections are right, the US market could be worth $25bn within a few years, versus about $1bn today. That should concentrate minds. One can applaud a rare example of long-termism on the part of a UK board and UK shareholders. In the lockdown panic last March Entain’s shares fell to 300p, so refusing £13.83 was not a given. If only such far-sightedness was more common. Proper technology companies, such as Arm Holdings, have been sold down the river in the past.

Fidelity, a big investor in both firms, seems to have provided the introductions and will be delighted. Talk that Deliveroo might be worth £5bn now sounds slightly less fanciful. Other Next shareholders may be scratching their heads, though, and wondering if Wolfson, after almost 20 years in post, is thinking about retiring to the back benches of boardrooms. One strongly suspects that’s not the case. Wolfson’s explanation that Deliveroo, like Next, uses “advanced technology” sounds plausible. Translation: it could be useful in the day job to see from inside how another firm buys IT. One extra-curricular excursion is probably enough, though.
Finance must confront the Hong Kong question A sign of the times? Elliott Management, the giant US hedge fund, is closing its Hong Kong office and switching staff to Tokyo and London, reports the FT. Elliott did not link the decision to Beijing’s imposition of draconian security laws on Hong Kong but, then again, financial institutions rarely make political statements when they don’t have to. A globally active firm with $40bn under management would normally be expected to keep a presence in Hong Kong, still the pre-eminent financial hub in Asia. Now, after 15 years in the territory, Elliott is leaving. The move should certainly prompt self-examination elsewhere. HSBC seems prepared to be bullied by Beijing for reasons of commercial survival, even to the point of freezing the accounts of pro-democracy activists, but there’s no reason why nimbler firms should stay put. Capital is mobile and, we’re often told, socially responsible these days. Regardless of Elliott’s motives, boards of financial firms should be asking the Hong Kong question."
2021-01-19T19:49:20Z,business,Business,Wetherspoon moves to buy up property on the cheap amid Covid crisis,"Wetherspoon has unveiled plans to expand by buying up property after prices plunged due to the pandemic, while a new venture fronted by the former boss of Greene King is looking to purchase small pubs and bars. In a statement to investors, Wetherspoon said it was raising up to £93.7m by placing new shares. It said the money would be used to strengthen a balance sheet damaged by the pandemic and offset the impact of an expected slow start once pubs reopen. But the 871-strong pub chain said the money would also “facilitate the acquisition of new properties, which are likely to be available at favourable prices, as a result of the pandemic”.
It is targeting spaces in central London, where retail and hospitality have been particularly hard-hit due to the loss of tourist traffic and office workers. “It may be possible to achieve a higher-than-average return on capital on properties acquired in the next few years, based on the company’s past experience,” Wetherspoon said. The chain announced its intentions on the same day that it emerged the former Greene King boss Rooney Anand is leading a new venture ready to spend £200m in a major gamble on recovery for the pubs sector. Redcat Pub Company has financial backing from an unnamed US-based private equity firm to acquire smaller pubs and bars, City sources told Sky News, which first reported the story. The opportunity for those with capital to buy venues at knockdown prices comes in the wake of a prolonged period in which the licensed trade has been among the hardest hit by the impact of the coronavirus. Many city pubs have been closed for longer than large, rural pubs because they cannot meet social distancing standards The industry trade body said on Tuesday that parts of the sector were “hanging by a thread” and bemoaned the length of time it was taking for government grants to arrive.
Nearly three-quarters of the pubs promised a £1,000 grant by the prime minister to help them survive the loss of Christmas sales in England are still waiting for the money, the British Beer & Pubs Association (BBPA) said. The grants, which local councils have been asked to distribute, were intended to help “wet-led” pubs, which do not serve food and instead rely on alcohol sales, leaving them particularly exposed to Covid-19 restrictions. Venues that did not serve food were unable to open over the traditionally lucrative Christmas period.
It was “scandalous” that many of its members were still waiting for cash promised in December 2020, the association said, warning that much of the industry was on the verge of financial ruin. More than half of the grants introduced to support pubs through the tier restrictions and November lockdown were also yet to be paid. “Months have passed by yet still thousands of pubs are waiting on the grants they have been promised,” said the BBPA chief executive, Emma McClarkin. “These grants are a vital lifeline, but only when delivered. “It is unbelievable that so many pubs are still waiting on their Christmas grants and grants for the second lockdown. Considering we are now in a third lockdown it is scandalous. “Publicans across the country are desperately checking their bank accounts every minute of every day to see if they have got their payment. Our sector is hanging by a thread, so for many pubs getting these grants is the difference between surviving or closing for good. “The prime minister personally promised some of these grants for wet-led pubs. We implore him to now intervene and ensure his promise is delivered.”
The grants are funded by government and are meant to be distributed by 314 local authorities, each of which have different systems in place for doing so. The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said some may be prioritising January grants, which are larger and in many cases may be going to the same businesses. “Councils are working fast to ensure businesses eligible for this funding are able to receive it quickly as possible,” a spokesperson for the association said, adding that its members had distributed £12bn to 880,000 small businesses in grants last year. McClarkin said central government needed to work with local authorities to ensure the money reached struggling businesses faster. A government spokesperson said: “We understand these are extremely challenging circumstances for businesses. We are working closely with local authorities, who are responsible for administering these grants, to ensure that funds are paid out as quickly as possible to those that need it.” • This article were amended on 22 January 2021. Wetherspoon has not stated that it intends to buy up “smaller pubs” as the headline of the earlier version said. This was an error based on reported plans by the Redcat Pub Company. Neither did Wetherspoon’s recent statement to investors say it planned to buy pubs in general as the article said. Rather the company announced that it is, “considering the acquisition of a number of properties in central London, the freehold reversions of pubs of which it is currently the tenant, and properties adjacent to successful pubs”. We apologise to J D Wetherspoon for these errors."
2021-01-19T18:54:16Z,business,Business,"Vauxhall plant at risk after 'brutal' 2030 ban, says Stellantis boss","The future of Vauxhall’s UK car production will depend on government support after the “brutal” decision to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, according to the boss of Stellantis, the newly formed carmaker. Stellantis was officially created on Saturday after the completion of the merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Peugeot, the owner of the Vauxhall brand. The merger, first announced in October 2019, has created a global automotive giant with 400,000 employees and 14 brands, but its completion has also refocused the spotlight on its plant in Ellesmore Port, one of Vauxhall’s two remaining British factories. Carlos Tavares, installed as Stellantis chief executive after leading Peugeot into the merger, said a final decision on whether to invest in production of a new car at Ellesmere Port will be made “within a few weeks”. He added a clear warning that the future of UK production “depends on the UK government’s willingness to protect some kind of an automotive industry in its own country”. Stellantis is in discussions with the UK government “to try to find a way that protects our people”, he said, speaking at a press conference on Tuesday after the new company’s shares started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. On a global level, Tavares insisted the merger would be a “shield” against job losses, particularly when the coronavirus pandemic has pushed down car sales and left some plants nearly idle. A larger company would be able to spread the heavy costs of developing new electric vehicles, as well as using its bulk to negotiate cheaper prices for materials and parts, he argued. However, Tavares suggested the UK ban on petrol and diesel cars had made it more difficult to invest in the Ellesmore Port plant in the Wirral, even though the Brexit deal reached on Christmas Eve removed the threat of tariffs or quotas on most car exports from the UK. There are about 1,100 workers at Ellesmere Port manufacturing the Astra car. The UK announced in November that it will ban the sale of pure internal combustion engine cars by 2030 to try to cut carbon dioxide emissions that cause global heating. The ban was brought forward from 2040, to the delight of environmental campaigners, but the change infuriated the car companies who still make big profits from selling petrol and diesel cars. “If you change, brutally, the rules and if you restrict the rules for business then there is at one point in time a problem,” Tavares said. “The more that we put stringent objectives on the automotive industry the more you get close to that limit.” Tavares added that the UK faced stiff competition from factories in the EU for electric vehicle investment. It would make sense to locate an electric vehicle factory closer to the larger EU market, he said.
“You put your investment close to where you sell the highest volume,” he said. “What is left for the UK? That’s the things that people should understand. This is not rocket science.” Matthias Schmidt, an independent automotive analyst, said Tavares’s comments were likely aimed “directly at Downing Street” in the hope that it would delay the 2030 deadline or at least opt for looser rules on which cars will be banned in 2030. Hybrid cars, combining internal combustion engine and battery power, will be allowed until 2035, to protect the jobs of UK workers. Some carmakers hope the government will allow hybrids with smaller batteries and consequently higher exhaust emissions. The UK also regularly supports the car industry with direct grants for research."
2021-01-19T18:52:30Z,business,Business,"Black, Asian and minority-ethnic UK workers hit worst by Covid job cuts","Black, Asian and minority-ethnic (BAME) workers have suffered the brunt of job cuts during the pandemic, according to analysis that shows the number in employment has dropped by 26 times more than the drop in white workers over the same period. The employment rate for people from BAME backgrounds slumped 5.3% in the year to September 2020, compared with a 0.2% decrease in the number of employed white workers. The TUC called on the government to act quickly to protect vulnerable BAME workers, many of whom faced redundancies in the accommodation and food sectors, where about a quarter of BME workers have lost their jobs. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said she blamed systemic racism that pushed a disproportionate number of such workers into low-income and part-time jobs. BAME workers have borne the brunt of the economic impact of this pandemic, she said. “In every industry where jobs have gone, BME people have been more likely to be made unemployed.” “The time for excuses and delays is over. Ministers must challenge the systemic racism and inequality that holds back BME people at work,” she added. Last month, the Office for National Statistics said its research into the wellbeing of different ethnic groups showed that 27% of people from black backgrounds reported finding it difficult to make financial ends meet, compared with fewer than 10% among most white groups. More people from BAME backgrounds worked in precarious and poorly paid jobs, leading them to be among the most worried about their household finances going into the pandemic in March. A rise in unemployment among BAME workers was likely to have played a part, the report found. More than 800,000 workers have been made redundant during the pandemic and the unemployment rate is expected to peak at about 7.5% sometime between April and June, according to data from the Office for Budget Responsibility. But the unemployment rate for BAME people has already reached 8.5%, much higher than the overall average of 4.9% and the 4.5% average for white workers, the TUC report said. Job losses have been concentrated in a handful of industries, with three industries accounting for 70% of job losses: 297,000 in accommodation and food, 160,000 in wholesale and retail and 115,000 in manufacturing. O’Grady said that in sectors such as hospitality, retail and the arts, BAME employment had “literally plummeted”. The number of black, Asian and minority-ethnic workers in the accommodation and food sector fell by 23%, compared with 13% among white workers, while the number of black women working in arts and entertainment dropped by two-fifths.
The TUC called on the government to introduce mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting, ban zero-hours contracts which disproportionately affect BAME workers, and publish all equality impact assessments on government responses to Covid-19. Patrick Roach, who chairs the TUC’s anti-racism taskforce, said: “During previous economic downturns, [BAME] workers have been ‘first out and last in’. “The government needs to address the causes and effects of structural racism and set out a national recovery plan that works for everyone.”"
2021-01-19T18:48:19Z,business,Business,Superdry warns over going concern risks as Covid-19 hurts sales,"Superdry shares have fallen sharply after the fashion brand issued a going concern warning, although the company’s founder insisted the business would survive the turmoil caused by the pandemic. The company’s shares closed down 16% after the uncertainty hanging over the business’s future was compounded by a gloomy financial picture of widening losses and a steep decline in sales over the key Christmas weeks. Julian Dunkerton, the company’s co-founder, who was reinstated two years ago after leading a successful boardroom coup, described the going concern warning as a “technicality” and explained its financial situation had improved since it was first added to the company’s accounts in 2020. “The reality is we’ve got £130m worth of liquidity and we didn’t even go overdrawn last year,” said Dunkerton. “If we were going to have any trouble, it would have been last March … but we didn’t. We’ve got cash, banking, and now we’ve got the end of the pandemic in sight.” Dunkerton, who started out selling clothes on a Cheltenham market stall, launched Superdry with the designer James Holder in 2003. Their first store opened in 2004 and after a period of rapid growth the firm listed on the stock exchange six years later. Even before the pandemic struck the businessman had warned a turnaround would take several years but, in common with other retailers, Superdry has been dealt a severe blow by the pandemic. The company said the disruption caused by Covid-19, including sudden and protracted store closures, made it “more difficult than ever to forecast the outturn for the year. Consequently we recognise the material uncertainty noted in our going concern assessment, and we are not providing formal guidance at this time for full year 21 or beyond.” The shares closed down 39p at 201p.
As of 9 January, 173 stores were temporarily closed, equivalent to around three-quarters of the group’s total. The company posted a pre-tax loss of £19m in the six months to 24 October on revenues of £283m, against a £4m loss a year earlier. Over the 11 weeks to 9 January sales were down 27%; while store sales halved, the company’s website sales grew at 13%. In recent years Superdry has been a rollercoaster ride for City investors. Its financial performance had gone backwards under the previous management, led by chief executive Euan Sutherland who has since joined over-50s specialist Saga, with the accompanying share price collapse causing Dunkerton to agitate for a return. Dunkerton said it would take time for work being done behind the scenes – including a push on using sustainable fabrics – to show up in the numbers, but the company was doing the right things, including recruiting the right “influencers” to reach young shoppers. It is now working with the Brazilian football star Neymar Jr, who has 143 million followers on social media. GlobalData analyst Gemma Boothroyd said the brand’s relevance had faded in recent years as consumers defected to cheaper rivals such as Asos as well as to desirable sports brands such as Nike and Adidas. “Given that Covid-19 lockdowns will continue to impact sales in the short term, Superdry’s new strategy to target and attract a younger demographic is imperative for its long term survival, as these shoppers are more accustomed to shopping online,” said Boothroyd."
2021-01-19T17:54:54Z,business,Business,Shell pulls out of joint venture to build UK sustainable jet fuels plant,"Shell has pulled out of a joint venture with British Airways and Velocys to build a flagship sustainable jet fuels plant in the UK – in a blow to Boris Johnson’s claims that Britain could deliver the world’s first zero-emission long-haul flight. The oil firm was named last year as one of the top companies set to “turbocharge government plans” for sustainable aviation fuels, the centrepiece of the so-called “jet zero” plan to decarbonise flights. Shell said it would leave the Altalto project, to be built in Immingham, Humberside, days after the company agreed to join a project in Canada which plans to produce more than double the green fuel from less than half the waste. Shell’s departure was by mutual consent, and the project would continue “according to its existing development plan”, the three parties behind the project said. Immingham could begin supplying its first aviation fuel from non-recyclable household waste within five years. But Shell’s decision to exit the UK’s burgeoning green fuels industry is likely to compound scepticism over Johnson’s promise that Britain would be in the “vanguard of green innovation” by pioneering zero-emission transatlantic flight. The departure comes after a number of false starts for BA’s plans for UK production of sustainable fuels. The airline shelved a proposed waste-to-fuel factory in Thurrock, Essex, which was due to open in 2017, blaming a lack of government support. Shell’s head of new fuels, Matthew Tipper, said the oil company was “pursuing multiple opportunities across our global portfolio”. “On this occasion, we have decided to focus our resources on other lower-carbon fuels opportunities which leverage our own technology. We will continue to work with the aviation industry and the UK government, as part of the jet zero council, to help decarbonise UK aviation,” he said. Shell announced plans earlier this month to take a 40% interest in the Varennes Carbon Recycling project, the first waste-to-low-carbon-fuels plant in Quebec, which will useMontreal-based cleantech company Enerkem’s proprietary technology. The pair plan to treat more than 200,000 tonnes of non-recyclable and wood waste annually to produce nearly 125m litres of low carbon fuels to help cut emissions from Canada’s transport industries. The UK’s Immingham Altalto project will use 500,000 tonnes of household and municipal waste to make 60m litres a year of higher-grade kerosene jet fuel. Velocys and BA said they had been in talks for several months with other potential sources of finance for the project, which was well placed to achieve significant government funding.
BA’s parent company, IAG, was the first airline group to pledge that its operations would become net zero by 2050, albeit largely through offsetting. BA’s chief executive, Sean Doyle, said: “Sustainable aviation fuel is vital to the decarbonisation of aviation and to helping us achieve our net zero target. We are excited to continue to work with Velocys, with the support of government and other private-sector partners.” Velocys said it was looking forward to moving to the next stage of development this year. The chief executive, Henrik Wareborn, said: “Altalto Immingham is ready to take advantage of the strong push from both government and industry for the decarbonisation of aviation, especially using waste feedstocks.” While manufacturers have said that hybrid-electric, or even hydrogen, short-haul commercial passenger jets could be feasible by 2035, long-haul net zero flights, if possible, are assumed to depend on sustainable jet fuels. • This article was amended on 20 January 2021 to clarify that the Varennes Carbon Recycling project and the Immingham Altalto project use different types of waste products, and produce different types of fuels."

2021-01-19T16:53:51Z,business,Business,"Streaming deals reflect success of biggest artists, says label boss","The UK chief executive of Universal Music, the home of stars including Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga and the Beatles, has said streaming deals reflect the success of biggest music artists – as it emerged it can take more than 1m streams to make £1,000. David Joseph also told MPs that greater effort was needed to force more royalty payments from YouTube, which is responsible for the majority of music consumption but pays relatively small fees by taking advantage of loopholes in copyright laws. In November, the Mercury prize-nominated singer-songwriter Nadine Shah told the digital, culture, media and sport select committee inquiry into the economics of music that despite her success and popularity she made so little from streaming that without income from live touring she was struggling to pay her rent. On Tuesday, the committee quizzed the UK bosses of the world’s three biggest record companies – Universal, Warner Music and Sony Music – about who has benefited from the streaming revolution that has revitalised the music industry.
The MP Alex Davies-Jones said that according to industry body the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), record labels in the UK made £1.1bn in 2019 while a typical musician made just over £23,000, against a national average of £29,000, citing the Office for National Statistics. Extracts of Shah’s testimony were read out to highlight how many artists are struggling. “Nadine Shah is a wonderful musician, she is a fantastic songwriter,” said Joseph. “The amount of money an artist gets in terms of streaming, the model is based on certain parts of popularity, all of the streams are coming to us and other artists are based on popularity. “It is true to say there are some artists who have been particularly badly hit by the pause in the live business because they have a relatively small fanbase but a very passionate fanbase they play live to very often. So inevitably their economy, as it were, has been very badly hit because playing live has not been available to them. “Unfortunately it is not possible, and not logical, that that would be instantly replaced by the money they make from [the streaming of] their recordings. That was never how their earnings were shaped.” The record company bosses were asked how many streams of a song were required for an artist to receive £1 of net profit. Tony Harlow, the chief executive Warner Music UK, whose artists include Ed Sheeran and Coldplay, estimated 1m streams would make £4,000 to £5,000 in revenue and that a recording artist may see £1,000 of that. “This is still a pretty new industry and the economics are working their way through,” he said. “We are increasingly seeing more artists getting to the million stream, billion stream, multibillion stream mark as the economics work better and better.”
Harlow said that in 2016 there were 582 Warner Music artists who hit 1m streams, and eight who reached 1bn. In 2020, 1,739 achieved 1m, 35 passed 1bn and four managed more than 10bn streams. Joseph suggested that not all major platforms popular for music consumption were paying a fair share to labels and artists. “I do not think streaming services are perfect,” he said. “I think there is lots more we can do for artists that I want to discuss. [But] it is hard against this backdrop of YouTube [where] 70% of the music of our artists [is] being consumed and giving us only 5% of our revenues.”"

2021-01-19T16:22:33Z,business,Business,Janet Yellen says Biden must 'act big' with coronavirus relief package,"Janet Yellen, US president-elect Joe Biden’s nominee for treasury secretary, told lawmakers on Tuesday that “the smartest thing we can do is act big” on the next coronavirus relief package, adding that the benefits outweigh the costs of a higher debt burden. In testimony at her virtual confirmation hearing, Yellen said her task as treasury chief would be twofold: first to help Americans endure the final months of the coronavirus pandemic, and second to rebuild the US economy “so that it creates more prosperity for more people and ensures that American workers can compete in an increasingly competitive global economy”.
Yellen observed that economists and others have noted that the recovery from the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic has been “K-shaped” – with the well-off bouncing back sharply while the less advantaged have slid further into financial difficulties. “This is especially true of people of color,” said Yellen. But Yellen noted that the K-shaped economy long predated the pandemic and said it was the treasury’s role to try to address these inequalities. Yellen’s testimony was a marked contrast to the Trump administration’s fiscal priorities. She called climate change “an existential threat” and argued international cooperation was needed to end the “destructive, global race to the bottom on corporate taxation.” Biden, who will be sworn into office on Wednesday, outlined a $1.9tn stimulus package proposal last week, saying bold investment was needed to jump-start the economy and accelerate the distribution of vaccines to bring the virus under control. “Neither the president-elect, nor I, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country’s debt burden. But right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big,” Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair, said in prepared remarks to the Senate finance committee.
“I believe the benefits will far outweigh the costs, especially if we care about helping people who have been struggling for a very long time,” she said in the statement, which was obtained by Reuters. The proposed aid package includes $415bn to bolster the US response to the virus and the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, some $1tn in direct relief to households, and roughly $440bn for small businesses and communities particularly hard hit by the pandemic. Many Americans would receive stimulus payments of $1,400, which would be on top of the $600 checks approved in a pandemic relief bill passed by Congress last month. Supplemental unemployment insurance would also increase to $400 a week from the current $300 a week, and it would be extended to September. Yellen received an endorsement from all living former treasury secretaries, from George Shultz to Jack Lew, who urged senators in a letter to swiftly confirm Yellen’s nomination so she can quickly tackle “daunting challenges” in the economy. “Addressing these pressing issues will require thoughtful engagement by the Department of the Treasury. Any gap in its leadership would risk setting back recovery efforts,” the former secretaries wrote."
2021-01-19T15:42:01Z,business,Business,Janet Yellen says US must 'act big' to revive flagging economy,"Janet Yellen, the economist picked by Joe Biden to run the US Treasury, has said America needs to “act big” to revive its flagging economy and protect itself against long-term scarring with a major stimulus package. The former chairman of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, underlined the new administration’s determination to press ahead with plans to boost government spending when she told a Senate committee that the benefits of action by Washington outweighed the costs. In prepared remarks that led to an early rise in share prices on Wall Street, Yellen said: “Economists don’t always agree, but I think there is a consensus now: without further action, we risk a longer, more painful recession now – and long-term scarring of the economy later.”
Biden published details last week of a plan involving payments to workers, higher unemployment benefits and extra cash to speed up America’s vaccination programme, but despite taking control of both houses of Congress and the White House the president elect will still have a struggle to get his package through in full. Yellen stepped up the pressure for Republicans on Capitol Hill to support Biden’s initiative at a time when the economy’s recovery has slowed due to restrictions imposed to slow the spread of Covid-19. “Over the next few months, we are going to need more aid to distribute the vaccine; to reopen schools; to help states keep firefighters and teachers on the job,” she said. “We’ll need more funding to make sure unemployment insurance checks still go out; and to help families who are at risk of going hungry or losing the roof over their heads.” Yellen sought to counter expected criticisms from Republicans that the $1.9tn (£1.4bn) plan was unaffordable given that its budget deficit is already running at 15% of gross domestic product and its national debt is close to 100% of GDP. “Neither the president-elect, nor I, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country’s debt burden. But right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big. In the long run, I believe the benefits will far outweigh the costs, especially if we care about helping people who have been struggling for a very long time.”"
2021-01-19T14:12:34Z,business,Business,Energy agency forecasts lower demand for oil as Covid cases surge,"World oil demand will be lower than forecast this year as a surge in new coronavirus cases looks likely to keep restrictions on the global economy in place, the International Energy Agency has said. The agency warned that a string of new lockdowns across big economies will keep a lid on oil demand over the first months of the year, before the impact of Covid-19 vaccines begins to take effect in the second half. The IEA’s influential monthly oil report has cut demand forecasts for the first quarter of this year by 600,000 barrels a day, and has trimmed its projections for the year by 300,000 barrels a day. “It will take more time for oil demand to recover fully as renewed lockdowns in a number of countries weigh on fuel sales,” the report said. “For now, a resurgence in Covid-19 cases is slowing the rebound, but a widespread vaccination effort and an acceleration in economic activity is expected to spur stronger growth in the second half of the year.” The Paris-based agency expects oil demand to rise by 5.5m barrels a day this year compared with 2020, when global work and travel restrictions to stem the spread of Covid-19 caused a fall of a record 8.8m barrels a day from the year before. The world’s supply will rise by a relatively modest 1m barrels a day under the stewardship of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which aims to hold market prices up by limiting crude production. The cartel and its allies, known as Opec+, staved off a complete collapse in oil prices last year by cutting output by a record 10% to prevent supplies overwhelming the market. Opec ministers agreed to hold off on raising output in the first few months of 2021, and the group’s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, has agreed to hold back an extra 1m barrels a day to keep prices from falling. The IEA said Opec’s disciplined production could help the market reduce crude stockpiles, which built up early last year before the historic production cuts. “Much more oil is likely to be required, given our forecast for a substantial improvement in demand in the second half of the year,” the IEA said. The decision to keep the production cuts in place has boosted the price of Brent crude, the international oil market benchmark, to more than $57 a barrel from below $43 a barrel at the start of January as commodity market traders bet on a post-Covid rebound later this year.
The IEA said rising prices could tempt US oil and gas frackers to increase production across the US shale heartlands, which recorded the biggest fall in crude output last year. “For now though, [US shale] companies seem committed to pledges made to keep production flat and instead use any price gain to pay down debt or to boost investor returns,” the IEA said. “If they stick to those plans, Opec+ may start to reclaim the market share it has steadily lost to the US and others since 2016.”"
2021-01-19T13:20:37Z,business,Business,Trading floor ready to close as London Metal Exchange moves to modernise,"The sharp suited traders at the London Metal Exchange may never return to their red leather benches, after the managers of Europe’s last remaining in-person trading floor set out plans to move entirely to electronic trading. The LME’s proposed closure of the Ring – known for its distinctive circle of red sofas – would mark one of the biggest changes to the world’s oldest and largest metal bourse since its founding in a City of London coffee house in 1877. The LME, which is owned by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange parent HKEX, hosts the last remaining open outcry floor in Europe, following closures at the London International Financial Futures Exchange in 2000, and International Petroleum Exchange in 2005. The LME’s move to digital would leave just a handful of in-person trading sites in the world’s big financial centres, with the New York Stock Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange among the last to hold on to the tradition. LME members usually set the world’s daily benchmark prices for industrial metals such as copper, aluminium and zinc by shouting buy and sell orders across the Ring during intense five-minute sessions throughout the trading day. However, the Covid crisis resulted in trades going completely electronic, giving members a glimpse into a future without the more raucous scenes and quirky rules that the LME has become famous for. While Ring-dealing members are technically allowed to stand up and lunge as they yell their orders, they have to keep one of their heels on the base of the leather couches. Standing breaches resulted in fines worth £13,750 being doled out to 11 firms including JP Morgan Chase in 2014. Members are banned from chewing gum and are bound by a strict dress code, which includes keeping your top button fastened, your jacket on and hair presentable, or else risk being fined. The proposed closure of the Ring follows a string of changes in recent years. In 2019, it issued a daytime drinking ban and cracked down on LME parties being held at strip clubs and casinos to help clean up its boys’ club image and reputation for liquid lunches as chronicled by one of its former traders, Nigel Farage. LME chief executive Matthew Chamberlain said the debate over the Ring’s closure “has been smouldering at the LME for 10 years”.
“We have tried to be really careful to not use the pandemic as an excuse to close the Ring. But, on the other hand, we can’t ignore the fact that we’ve now been doing electronic pricing for 10 months, and we’ve got a great set of data,” Chamberlain explained. The LME boss said he expected the nine Ring dealing firms to argue their focus and expertise result in better pricing. But barring broader opposition, the LME could shut the Ring as early as May 2021, meaning traders who left last March may never return to their red leather couches. Chamberlain said the Ring was a treasured part of the LME’s history and its potential closure was not a decision that would be taken lightly. “However, the LME has stood the test of time precisely because of its ability to adapt.”"
2021-01-19T11:42:42Z,business,Business,Deliveroo appoints Next's Wolfson as a non-executive as it gears up for float,"Deliveroo has drafted in the Next boss, Simon Wolfson, as a non-executive director in a significant coup before the takeaway delivery company’s stock exchange listing. It is the first non-executive role that Wolfson, the FTSE 100’s longest-serving chief executive, has taken. It follows this weekend’s confirmation of Deliveroo’s flotation plans and a $180m (£132m) injection from existing shareholders. Will Shu, Deliveroo’s founder and chief executive, said Wolfson would bring “great knowledge and insight to the company and help us in our mission to become the definitive food company”. Deliveroo is among the internet companies to benefit from big pandemic-related shifts in consumer spending, with the latest round of investor funding valuing the company at more than $7bn. Its shareholders include Amazon, which owns a 16% stake. Wolfson, a scion of a well-known retail family, has been running Next since 2001. He began his role at Deliveroo this week. Former Premier League acting chair Claudia Arney became the company’s first board chair in November. Wolfson, 53, who is also a Conservative peer, said Deliveroo was an “exciting, innovative and fast-growing company that, like Next, relies on advanced technology to deliver a market-leading proposition”. Next has fared better than many of its high street rivals during the pandemic benefiting from years of investment in its home shopping arm as sales were forced online when stores were closed.
Deliveroo said it would use the new money to expand its network of delivery-only kitchen sites – called “dark kitchens” – grocery delivery and subscription services, as well as allowing more restaurants to take orders via their own websites. Shu, a former investment banker, launched Deliveroo from his London flat in 2013. Today the company works with 140,000 restaurants and 110,000 riders in more than 800 towns and cities around the world. Speaking in December, Shu said Covid-19 had accelerated consumer adoption of food delivery services by about two to three years, with order volumes in the UK and Ireland now running at double 2019 levels. “We’ve demonstrated our model is profitable,” he said, adding that the previously loss-making company had been “profitable at the operating level for over six months now”."
2021-01-19T11:20:42Z,business,Business,Boeing 737 Max could fly in Europe this summer after EU approval,"The Boeing 737 Max could return to European skies by the summer once approval for the plane to fly again is granted in the EU next week. It would mark a critical step in its return to service, after the 737 Max was grounded worldwide following crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia caused by a faulty sensor, which repeatedly triggered a system that pushed the nose down. A total of 346 people died in the two accidents. Patrick Ky, the executive director of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), said on Tuesday it would publish an updated airworthiness directive next week, following in the footsteps of regulators in the US and Brazil. UK regulators must certify the plane separately. The 737 Max will be able to return to service in the EU as soon as Boeing, the US’s aerospace champion, has updated software and rewired some components, and airlines have trained their pilots in the changes. Speaking at an event held by Germany’s aviation press, Ky said the version of the 737 Max bought by the Irish airline Ryanair will be certified “in the coming weeks”, meaning it will probably be ready for service by summer.
A Ryanair spokesperson said the airline expected to receive its first deliveries of the newly ordered planes in late March or early April, meaning it would be flying passengers in the 737 Max for the first time in April. However, the airline has said it will not tell passengers ahead of time what aircraft will be used. The British Airways owner, International Airlines Group, announced its intention to buy 200 Max planes in 2019, but has yet to make a firm order. Approval in the UK is likely to follow in the weeks after EASA’s official green light. Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) gained responsibility for aircraft certification after the UK left the single market on 31 December. A CAA spokesman reiterated a previous statement that it was fully involved in EASA’s work on the 737 Max before Brexit. It will base its UK decision on this work as well as information from Boeing and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the statement said. Airlines in Brazil and the US are already operating commercial flights using the plane after a protracted process of reexamining it in minute detail. Multiple investigations following the crashes found serious flaws in the regulatory regime governing plane safety and within Boeing. A report by US politicians in September accused Boeing of endangering passenger safety by cutting costs, and said the FAA had let itself be influenced by the US manufacturer. Ky acknowledged that EASA had been reliant on the FAA’s judgement of which systems and components were safe before the crashes, meaning it lacked some crucial information. He said the European regulator was now making its own assessment of which parts of the aircraft were safety-critical, rather than relying on the FAA’s judgement. Some 20 EASA officials have worked on the 737 Max recertification for the last two years. Future certifications could take more time than before the crashes as regulators adapt to new processes, Ky said. Referring to two variants of the 737 Max, a Boeing spokeswoman said: “We continue to work with EASA, other global regulators and our customers to safely return the 737-8 and 737-9 to service worldwide.”"
2021-01-19T11:12:05Z,business,Business,Moonpig confirms stock market flotation for up to Â£1.2bn,"The online greeting card and gifts retailer Moonpig has outlined plans for a £1.2bn float on the London Stock Exchange, after demand surged for its personalised products during the coronavirus pandemic. Announcing new details of the planned initial public offering, Moonpig, which has been owned by the private equity firm Exponent since 2016, said it would float at least a quarter of the company. The US firms BlackRock and Dragoneer Global Fund have agreed to buy £130m of the shares, which are expected to start trading next month. The retailer is chaired by Kate Swann, the former chief executive of WH Smith who is expected to make £7m from the float. Nickyl Raithatha, the Moonpig chief executive, is in line for £11m and the finance director, Andy MacKinnon, will also benefit, with £2m. Moonpig is expected to publish its prospectus next week with further details. Its 450 employees will also be given shares. The decision to float comes after a stellar year for the company, which sells cards that can be personalised as well as a range of gifts including flowers, prosecco, gin, beer and chocolate. The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a boom in sales, as Moonpig won 1 million new customers in the first eight weeks of the first national lockdown in the spring. It is the UK’s biggest online greeting card retailer with more than 12 million customers, as multiple lockdowns forced high street rivals such as Clintons to shut their doors. Moonpig also trades in the Netherlands, under the name Greetz, which means greetings in Dutch.
The firm delivered 46m cards and 7m gifts and flowers in the 12 months to October, and it deals with up to 300,000 orders a day, one third of which come via its app. Moonpig made £156m in sales in the six months to the end of October, compared with £173m for the entire previous year. Raithatha said: “As leaders of a market undergoing an accelerating shift online, we’re delighted to bring Moonpig Group to the public market. Our data-powered technology platform makes it incredibly easy for our customers to create more special moments for the people they care about.” Moonpig was founded two decades ago by Nick Jenkins, a former commodities trader at Glencore and Dragon’s Den star, who named the firm after his schoolboy nickname. He made £42m in 2011 from the sale of the business to the online photo printing company Photobox, which was subsequently bought by the private equity firms Electra and Exponent. Photobox and Moonpig were split into separate businesses in 2019."
2021-01-19T09:43:55Z,business,Business,"Fighting climate crisis made harder by Covid-19 inequality, says WEF","Tackling the existential risk posed by the climate crisis will be made harder by the growing gap between rich and poor triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Economic Forum has said. The body that organises the annual gathering of the global elite in the Swiss town of Davos said warning signs of the threat posed by infectious disease had been ignored for the past 15 years, with disastrous results. Despite the loss of almost 2 million lives to Covid-19, the WEF’s global risks report found that environmental issues were considered to pose the biggest danger in the coming years, both in terms of impact and likelihood. Klaus Schwab, the executive chairman of the WEF, said: “In 2020, the risk of a global pandemic became reality. As governments, businesses and societies survey the damage inflicted over the last year, strengthening strategic foresight is now more important than ever.” Schwab added: “Growing societal fragmentation – manifested through persistent and emerging risks to human health, rising unemployment, widening digital divides, and youth disillusionment – can have severe consequences in an era of compounded economic, environmental, geopolitical and technological risks.” The WEF report said the Covid-19 pandemic had widened longstanding health, economic and digital disparities, making it harder to secure the international cooperation needed to combat challenges such as environmental degradation. Extreme weather events were considered to be the top risk measured by the likelihood of them happening, followed by climate action failure, human environmental damage, infectious diseases and bio-diversity loss. The top five risks in terms of impact were infectious diseases, climate action failure, weapons of mass destruction, biodiversity loss and natural resource crises. For the first time, the report assessed risks according to when respondents thought they would pose a critical threat to the world. Short-term dangers – which could happen at any time in the next two years – revealed concern about infectious diseases, employment crises, digital inequality and youth disillusionment.
Over the medium term – three to five years – respondents believe the world will be threatened by knock-on economic and technological risks, which may take several years to materialise – such as asset bubble bursts, IT infrastructure breakdown, inflation and debt crises. Longer term concerns – five to 10 years – were dominated by existential threats, such as weapons of mass destruction, state collapse and biodiversity. The WEF said it was hard for governments and businesses to address long-term risks but the pandemic had shown that ignoring the dangers did not make them less likely to happen. The global risks survey is normally released a week before the annual meeting of the WEF but the pandemic has meant only a virtual event has been possible. A physical gathering is planned for Singapore in May."
2021-01-19T06:00:48Z,business,Business,Holiday bookings surge as Covid vaccinations increase travel hopes,"Holiday companies have reported an increase in bookings as the UK’s coronavirus vaccine rollout gives people hope that they will soon be able to travel overseas again. Despite a series of negative travel announcements in recent days, including the closure of air corridors and words of caution from ministers over foreign holidays, there are signs that those among the first in line for the vaccinations are starting to plan trips, and that consumers are hopeful about taking a break later this year. The travel association Abta said it was hearing from members that the over-50s represented a much higher proportion of early bookers than normal.
Saga, which specialises in holidays for the over-50s, reported rising numbers of bookings for this year and next. Traffic to its bookings website was up by 16% in the first two weeks of this year, compared with the first two weeks of December, while sales made through Saga had doubled over the same period. The interest comes despite the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, saying it was too early to plan for summer holidays this year because of travel restrictions and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, suggesting on Monday that holidays abroad may not be a given. Bookings for long-haul trips for 2022 have also surged, suggesting an appetite for “once-in-a-lifetime holidays”, Saga said, while people are booking for longer even for short-haul destinations. Saga said 70% of short-haul-stay bookings between November 2021 and January 2022 were for 21 nights or longer. Chris Simmonds, the chief executive of Saga Holidays, said: “Many of our guests are hopeful that they will be able to travel again soon, with the vaccine providing them the optimism they need to start planning ahead. “Of course, given we cater exclusively for people aged over 50, many of our customers are near the top of the queue for a vaccine, which is giving them the confidence to start thinking about travelling again, as well as returning to other parts of normal life.” The tour operator Tui said older travellers were making up more of its bookings than usual. A spokesperson said: “We’re seeing more interest in holidays from an age group that wasn’t coming through before, with the over-50s starting to book, we assume, on the back of the positive vaccine news. “Since the end of last year, bookings from this group have accounted for 50% of all our web bookings, as customers long for a sunshine break later in summer, in particular in Greece, Turkey or the Balearics.” It also reported customers booking longer breaks than previously, with many opting for 10, 11 or 14 nights instead of seven. It suggested this was to make up for not having had a holiday in 2020. The airline easyJet said its holiday bookings for the summer were 250% higher than they had been at this point last year. Its chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said: “We have seen easyJet holidays bookings from our over-50s customers increase over the last few weeks in comparison to pre-Christmas, which suggests a further confidence boost from the vaccine rollout.” Lundgren said there was “pent-up demand”, adding: ”We have seen that every time restrictions have been relaxed and so we know that people want to go on holiday as soon as they can.”
Skyscanner, which offers flights and hotels via its website, said searches and bookings remained lower than normal for the time of year but there were signs that activity was picking up. Searches were up by 12% over the week and bookings by 7%, with July 2021 the most searched for month. Other firms reported bookings were higher for this September and October, suggesting consumers were hopeful that vaccines may have been delivered and travel restrictions lifted by the autumn. On Monday, tough new testing rules came into effect that require all those arriving in the UK to show a negative Covid-19 test or face a potential £500 fine. The UK has also closed all its travel corridors, meaning people arriving will be required to quarantine. Meanwhile, an official close to the Australian government has warned that tourists could face “substantial border restrictions” for most of 2021. Returning Australian travellers must pay about AU$3,000 (£1,700) to quarantine inside a hotel room for 14 days."
2021-01-19T00:01:42Z,business,Business,More than a third of UK shoppers blocked from paying with cash in Covid-19 crisis,"More than a third of shoppers have been blocked from paying with cash since the start of the Covid crisis, prompting calls for urgent action to protect the millions who rely on the UK’s “critically endangered” cash network. The consumer group Which? said mixed messages about the safety of cash was partly to blame. The Bank of England has since clarified that “any risk from handling cash should be low”, especially when compared with touching shopping baskets, self-checkout screens or products in stores. About 34% of shoppers surveyed by Which? said they had been turned away on at least one occasion when they tried to pay with cash since the first Covid lockdown. Shoppers were most likely to be refused cash payments when they bought groceries, which accounted for 28% of incidents, though pubs and restaurants accounted for 24% of cases. About 21% of cases were linked to consumers trying to buy cleaning products, which have become even more essential since the outbreak. Which? wants the government to track the number of businesses that have scrapped cash over the past year, warning that the trend could undermine the Treasury’s efforts to keep cash from disappearing. Its survey suggests 10 million people across the UK – including elderly and vulnerable consumers – rely on cash and would struggle without it. Natalie Ceeney, the chair of the the Access to Cash Review, said: “This is cause for concern. The figures show that it’s not simply the odd coffee shop going cashless, but this is creeping into the wider economy.” Last year, the Treasury said it was considering changing rules that would allow shops to offer cashback without a purchase and would put the Financial Conduct Authority in charge of overseeing the UK’s cash system. However, there are growing concerns that the government has failed to act quickly enough, and that its efforts could be undermined by the falling number of businesses accepting cash. The Which? money editor, Jenny Ross, said the government “must urgently make the FCA responsible for tracking cash acceptance levels. Failure to do so will see the cash network crumble and leave millions of people abandoned.” In one case found by Which?, James Boswell, a diabetic, was urgently trying to find food when his blood sugar levels dropped after being stuck in traffic on the M25. However, Boswell was turned away at both Nando’s and El Mexicana restaurants when he was only able to offer cash, despite explaining his situation. A Nando’s spokesperson said the chain was only accepting app-based payment because of Covid safety measures, but apologised and said an exception should have been made in Boswell’s case. El Mexicana said it would reintroduce cash “when we think it’s appropriate”. The Age UK charity director, Caroline Abrahams, said cash was essential for millions of older people who may need to pay back carers who did their shopping, or use it as a backup if they were not online. “During these uncertain and worrying times, these are the people who need continuing access to a convenient and affordable payment method they can trust,” she said.
“We are now hurtling towards a cashless society without enough consideration for the many people who will be left behind.” Ceeney said individual businesses were not solely to blame and many were going cashless because local bank branch closures made it harder to deposit cash. “The government needs to urgently legislate to protect the viability of cash – as it promised to do so last year,” she said. “Time is running out.” The Treasury said: “We are working closely with the financial regulators to monitor the risks around cash through the pandemic. The government is already looking at cash access issues – including cash acceptance – and we’ll set out the next steps in that process in due course.”"
2021-01-19T00:01:41Z,business,Business,"Firms cannot wait until budget for more Covid help, Rishi Sunak told","The UK’s leading employers’ organisation has warned Rishi Sunak that businesses running short of cash and resilience cannot afford to wait six weeks for the budget to secure more financial help from the government. Tony Danker, the director-general of the CBI, called on the chancellor to extend the furlough scheme, defer VAT payments and resist the temptation to raise business taxes as a way of plugging the UK’s record peacetime budget deficit.
In its budget submission to the chancellor, the CBI called for an immediate £7.6bn injection from the Treasury as part of a £17.9bn package designed to see the economy through lockdown, stimulate investment over the coming year and prepare the UK for the challenges of the coming decade. “The budget comes at a crucial time for the UK. The government’s support from the very start of this crisis has protected many jobs and livelihoods, and progress on the vaccine rollout brings real cause for optimism,” Danker said. “But almost a year of disrupted demand and extensive restrictions to company operations is taking its toll. Staff morale has taken a hit. And business resilience has hit a sobering new low.” The newly appointed head of the CBI said he thought there was a strong chance that the chancellor would respond to the call for: A £6bn extension of the furlough scheme – which subsidises the wages of temporarily laid-off workers – beyond its planned end in April to the end of June and further targeted support to protect jobs subsequently. Lengthening repayment periods for existing VAT deferrals until June 2021 at the earliest and allow firms to defer VAT bills for the first quarter of 2021 for 12 months. An extension of the business rates holiday for at least another three months to those UK firms forced to close under current restrictions and expanding relief to their supply chains. Danker said firms tended to make plans at the start of the calendar year and were making key calls about jobs, premises and investment now. He said he thought Sunak would listen to the growing clamour from business. “If you want to have effective policy I don’t think you can wait until 3 March [budget day]. Firms are not going to wait until 3 March before making decisions.” Sunak and Boris Johnson spoke to 30 business leaders – including Danker – on Monday at the first meeting of the government’s Build Back Better Council, which is part of the effort to speed up the recovery after the pandemic. The chancellor is also setting up a “better regulation committee” to review regulation in Britain now the country is outside the EU, to try to better stimulate growth and attract new investment. Danker said the CBI was interested in smarter regulation that prompted higher investment but stressed that the immediate priority was to prevent an over-rapid withdrawal of government support that would result in businesses going under. “Business support needs to go in parallel with the tiering of restrictions. We are not going to have an overnight opening up of the economy, so it would be wrong to end support for business overnight.”
Asked to comment on reports that Sunak was planning to announce an increase in corporation tax – currently levied at a main rate of 19% – in the Budget, Danker said: “It would be wrong to raise business taxes when we don’t have a recovery. It’s as simple as that.” The chancellor has insisted that the government must eventually take steps to reduce its budget deficit – the gap between tax income and government spending – which is on course to reach about £400bn in the current 2020-21 financial year. Danker said the chancellor should be “hugely cautious”, adding: “The government can’t have enough certainty about the next six months to have a business tax increase in the next year.”"
2021-01-19T00:01:40Z,business,Business,Dr Martens flotation may create around 50 instant multi-millionaires,"The Dr Martens flotation is still at the warm-up stage, meaning the owners announce their intention to list the company, then formally confirm their plan, as happened on Monday, all the while using the spotlight to talk up the brand’s “iconic” and “unique” status. Fair enough – that’s how the float game is played. Soon, though, the outside world will see a prospectus, at which point there’ll be something new to talk about: the spectacular returns about to be enjoyed by the partners of Permira, Dr Martens’ private equity owner since 2014, plus management. Welcome to the miracle of “carried interest” – the portion of an investment profit that the private equity crew and managers retain as a bonus for success. It’s normally worth 20%, so will spit out some very large numbers in the case of Dr Martens, a business bought for £300m from the founding Griggs family (which wisely kept a minority stake) and now being brought to the stock market with a price-tag of £3bn-plus.
How large will the “carried interest” pool at Dr Martens be? Peter Morris, associate scholar at Saïd business school in Oxford, has crunched the data filed at Companies House since the buyout and has an answer. At a valuation of £3bn, the carry pool would be worth £410m, at £3.5bn, it’ll be £485m; and £4bn would mean £560m. Now consider that only 300 people work at Permira and that the “carry” spoils tend to be concentrated among senior staff. If 80% of the pool were to be shared equally among 50 individuals, at Permira and among Dr Martens’ management, each person would be looking at between £6.6m (at a £3bn valuation) and £9m (at a £4bn valuation). Those figures are averages, per head, for 50 people. A few qualifications are needed. First, we don’t know precisely what investment hurdle Permira employs before “carried interest” kicks in (Morris has assumed 8%, typical for the industry). Nor do we know how Permira allocates its bonus pool; sums for individuals could be diluted by duff investments elsewhere by the same fund. And, of course, the numbers assume a complete disposal of Dr Martens, whereas the float is the only the first stage in the sell-down. But the picture looks broadly correct. Dr Martens – “a canvas for rebellious self-expression across generations,” or so the corporate hype has it – is about to create a large cast of multi-millionaires. The investors in the relevant Permira fund will also do very well, obviously, but “carried interest” is the real kicker for the private equity crew. Indeed, it gets better still for them. “Carried interest” payments are treated as capital gains, and thus taxed at only 28%, rather than at the top rate of income tax of 45%. That tax oddity has always looked indefensible since the beneficiaries aren’t putting any capital at risk and their winnings are bonuses in all but name. The Treasury, it was reported last autumn, is mulling reform. Any change would arrive too late for the Dr Martens float, but Rishi Sunak shouldn’t let that deter him. Use the latest example of a “carried interest” bonanza to inject some common sense. Financial engineers do not need personal tax breaks, especially not in the current climate. Business needs certainty on support before the budget Elsewhere the lobbying for budget reforms has started in earnest, but well done the CBI for reminding Sunak that the big event is still six weeks away, which is too long for some sectors to wait to learn whether fresh government support is on the way. The Treasury must employ a few people who have worked in business, so you would have thought the penny would have dropped: companies are making post-March employment and investment decisions now. In sectors affected by lockdown – such as non-food retail, hospitality, events and leisure – the timing of announcements matters. If Sunak intends to extend the furlough scheme, or grant more VAT and business rates holidays, he shouldn’t wait until March to say so. One assumes Sunak will have to approve at least some of the items on that list, if only until the end of June, to stay in step with the vaccination programme. But get on with it. The budget is a big set-piece event for the Treasury, but the business world just wants certainty as soon as possible."

Thatâ€™s its lowest closing point in nearly two weeks (although it was lower during Fridayâ€™s trading session). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx reckons it was the quietest session of the year so far, with Wall Street shuttered for Martin Luther King Day. In a sign, if one was needed, that Europe is often lost without American direction, the markets essentially took MLK Day off this Monday. Lacking a US intervention, broadly unimpressed with Chinaâ€™s Q4 GDP rebound due to a drop in retail sales, and anxious about how Wednesdayâ€™s inauguration is going to play out across the States, the European indices dozed through the session. With Brent Crude the wrong side of $55 per barrel, leaving BP and Shell in the red, the FTSE lost 0.2%, nudging it closer to 6,700.
Online grocery firm Ocado was the top riser, gaining 2.5%, along with UK-focused firms including banks Barclays and NatWest and retailers JD Sports and Next. Energy, technology and industrial stocks dropped though, as investors showed a little more anxiety over the global recovery despite Chinaâ€™s strengthening growth figures. Other European stock markets finished the day a little higher, with Germanyâ€™s DAX up around 0.36%. So thatâ€™s quite enough for today. Hereâ€™s our main stories:

2021-01-18T16:30:33Z,business,Business,The gap between Australian house prices and incomes is only likely to grow | Greg Jericho,"Australians love of housing continues with even more vigour during the Covid recession – powered by government incentives and record low interest rates, which look set to remain low for many years. In November a record $23.96bn in new housing loans were taken out. This record reveals how weird this recession is – there is higher unemployment, but it is mostly driven by forces that have little to do with the underlying strength of the economy.
It means that for those still with a full-time job things are pretty good – especially if you are thinking about buying a home. And so in November last year, the level of new housing loans was 24% above where it was 12 months earlier:
The big boost has come from owner-occupiers – up 31% over the 12 months compared to just a 4% growth for investors. This lack of investor loans however is just a continuation of what has happened since 2016 when the surge of apartment building came to an end. In November the total of owner-occupier loans was 38% above what it was in January 2017, while investor loans were down 38%:
And among owner-occupiers the big surge has come for those looking to build a new home. It has to be said that the government’s homebuilder grant of $25,000 for new builds and substantial renovations has worked as intended. Since it came into effect in June last year, the number of home loans for the construction of houses has doubled from 3,491 in June to 7,107 in November.
So great has been the surge of home loans to build houses that in November the number of such loans was well above even the level that occurred during the GFC when the Rudd government also introduced measures to boost housing construction:
And yet there has also been a big jump in the purchase of established homes. This is less to do with government policies and grants and more to do with the record low interest rates. It is true that even before the pandemic interest rates were at record lows, but the impact of the Reserve Bank dropping the cash rate to 0.1% might have had the opposite psychological impact that pushing it to 17% in 1989 had. Back then rates were already high but that final increase knocked the stuffing out of those with a mortgage, and it scared the hell out of those thinking about taking out a home loan. Similarly, if you were ever worried about holding off taking out a loan because of fears about interest rates, the RBA cutting the cash rate to 0.1% removed them. Even the most risk averse borrower was thinking now it’s the time to take out a loan. For many this has not just meant a home loan but also a car loan – the number of which has completely recovered from the drop in April last year:
Partly this is because the option of a big spend on an overseas holiday has completely dried up, and as a result loans for travel remains barely above zero:
But will these low rates last? We know that increases in home loans lead to an increase in house prices, and the Reserve Bank would not wish for a divergence of house prices while unemployment remains high – for such a level is unsustainable and risks a collapse once government grants end. It also will lead to a decrease in housing affordability as incomes will not keep pace with house prices. In the past that would have meant an increase in rates, but not now. Shane Wright reported on Monday in the Sydney Morning Herald that the RBA is instead looking at tightening lending standards should house prices continue to rise. It will need to do this because there is no prospect at the moment of any increase in wages and inflation that would force the RBA to lift rates. The most recent market inflation expectations suggests inflation growth will be well below the RBA’s target of 2% throughout this year:
Last November, the Reserve Bank announced that it “will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent target range”. This was a change on its previous advice that it would not do so until it was “confident that inflation will be sustainably within the 2–3 per cent target band”. As of now, actual inflation has not been above 2% for over five years – and when it was wages growth had been long above 2%:
The RBA has noted that to get inflation back above 2% “wages growth will have to be materially higher than it is currently” and this “will require significant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market”. In essence that means unemployment back around 5%. As a result the RBA “is not expecting to increase the cash rate for at least three years”. And so home loans are likely to continue to grow and so too will the gap between house prices and household income."
2021-01-18T16:21:38Z,business,Business,Small businesses win Covid insurance payouts after UK supreme court victory,"Hundreds of thousands of small businesses that were forced to close during the Covid-19 pandemic are expected to receive payouts on insurance claims worth more than £1bn after what was described as a “historic victory” at the supreme court. The Financial Conduct Authority, which brought the test case, said it would now be working with insurers to ensure they “move quickly” to pay claims to businesses, some of which have been struggling to stay afloat. Judges threw out the appeals from six insurance companies and largely supported the arguments made by the FCA and a policyholder action group – prompting the law firm Reed Smith to declare that this was “a catastrophic outcome” for insurers. The FCA has previously said that 370,000 policyholders may be affected by the outcome of the test case, and originally estimated the value of claims affected at about £1.2bn. However, some analysts have said several billion pounds could be at stake. The Hiscox Action Group, which represents policyholders, said insurers should be “in no doubt that they should immediately start doing the right thing and settle these claims”. Richard Leedham, a partner at the law firm Mishcon de Reya who represented the action group, said: “Today’s outcome is one of the most significant for business in modern times.” The complex case involves business interruption insurance, a key part of commercial policies which is meant to pay out if a firm cannot trade as usual owing to an unexpected event. Many small businesses, from restaurants and bars to hairdressers and guesthouses, claimed they should have received payouts from their insurers after the coronavirus lockdowns left them unable to trade. Insurers have been accused by some of relying on technical legal arguments to wriggle out of their responsibilities. Many insurers had declined to pay out, arguing that business interruption policies were not designed to cover a government-imposed lockdown. This prompted the FCA to launch a test case to provide clarity. One of the judges, Lord Briggs, delivered what the action group claimed was “a damning indictment” on the insurers’ words when he said the cover apparently provided for interruption caused by the effects of a notifiable disease causing a national pandemic “was in reality illusory, just when it might have been supposed to have been most needed by policyholders”. Briggs said that outcome seemed to him to be “clearly contrary to the spirit and intent of the relevant provisions of the policies in issue”. He added: “This was not, of course, a disease which anyone could have had specifically in mind when the policies in issue were written and marketed. But it is clear from the use of the definition of a ‘notifiable disease’ in most of the relevant clauses, and equivalent wording in the remainder, that Covid-19 [when it appeared] fell squarely within the types of disease for which all the relevant disease and hybrid clauses provided cover.” Hiscox said that as a result of the judgment, as well as further government restrictions announced during 2020, its total estimate for Covid-19 business interruption increased by $48m (£35m) net of reinsurance. The test case, which was heard by the supreme court in November, was brought by the FCA against eight insurers. The high court found in favour of policyholders on the majority of the key issues in September 2020. However, hopes of rapid payouts were quickly dashed when six of the eight insurers – Arch Insurance, Argenta, Hiscox, MS Amlin, QBE and RSA – appealed. The FCA also decided to appeal against some elements of the ruling. The FCA brought the case after receiving a large number of complaints from small businesses, MPs and others about claims being refused during the weeks after the first national lockdown, which began on 23 March. It said there had been “widespread concern about the lack of clarity and certainty for some customers making these claims, and the basis on which some firms are making decisions”. With many business interruption policies, the cover relates to physical damage to premises, which would not be eligible for payouts linked to the pandemic. However, in some cases the wording refers to an outbreak of a “disease” within the vicinity, or a “denial of access” to premises following public authority action taken due to an emergency.
The high court originally looked at 21 policy types, 13 of which ended up being considered by the supreme court. In November, the former footballer Gary Neville, who co-owns two hotels with his former Manchester United teammate Ryan Giggs, tweeted: “We have paid BI [business interruption] insurance for years and they won’t pay out! Due to ‘technicalities’. So many in the same boat. @RishiSunak made a speech in parliament stating insurers needed to pay. It’s not happening.” The head of the Association of British Insurers said the industry body welcomed the clarity the judgment would bring to several complex issues. “All valid claims will be settled as soon as possible and in many cases the process of settling claims has begun,” Huw Evans said. “We recognise this has been a particularly difficult time for many small businesses and naturally regret the Covid-19 restrictions have led to disputes with some customers. We will continue to work together as an industry to ensure customers have the clarity they need when it comes to what they can expect from their business insurance policies.” • This article was updated on 18 January 2021 to include a statement from the Association of British Insurers in response to the ruling."
2021-01-18T12:52:58Z,business,Business,UK supermarkets face more inspections over Covid-19 compliance,"Supermarkets face increased inspections from local councils to make sure they are Covid-19 secure amid a push from the government to clamp down further on coronavirus transmission. Local government officials have been asked by ministers to target the largest supermarkets for inspection to ensure companies are enforcing mask wearing, social distancing and limits on shopper numbers. Robert Jenrick, the cabinet minister for local government, as well as housing, will ask for “robust measures” by retailers, a government spokesperson has said. Local authorities already carry out safety inspections on premises routinely, and have the power to issue improvement notices, with possible fines or even jail time for repeated non-compliance. The Local Government Association (LGA), the body which represents English and Welsh councils, said its members would work with the police to take action against any breaches of rules. The push for increased scrutiny on supermarkets was first reported by the Daily Telegraph. Supermarkets and other food retailers have remained open throughout the pandemic because of their essential role. During the latest wave of national lockdowns in the UK the government has repeatedly signalled concerns about the spread of a more transmissible variant of the virus in supermarkets, given increasing infection numbers despite most other venues being closed. Morrisons and Sainsbury’s both said last week that they would increase efforts to enforce lockdown rules such as the mandatory wearing of masks, except for those people with medical exemptions. Morrisons said it would refuse to serve people if they did not comply, while Sainsbury’s said it would put security staff on the door of bigger shops. However, some supermarkets have balked at the suggestion that the industry was not previously doing enough to help combat a rapid rise in infection numbers. Some supermarkets said they would not be able to enforce rules on mask wearing without extra help from the police, and police sources said they would not have the resources to enforce mask wearing. The LGA said councils already had a role in spreading government messaging about safety and health during the pandemic. Councils have also shared safety checklists with counterparts, as well as helping shops and other venues with signage and floor markings, and using Covid-19 marshals to manage busy areas and to review business risk assessments, a legal requirement. A spokesman for the LGA said: “Supermarkets have been highlighted as areas of concern as one of the few types of business still able to be open. Some supermarkets have started to enforce their rules more effectively through the use of security guidance, and hopefully more will follow suit to help reduce transmission risk in these high-footfall areas.
“Councils will continue to work with local partners, including the police, to ensure they keep people safe and take action, if necessary and appropriate, against any breaches to help reduce infection rates.” The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Councils have been at the forefront of the response to the pandemic and at this critical point it is vital that everyone plays their part. “As part of this, the local government secretary is talking to councils about how they can work with retailers to ensure robust measures are in place to help protect the community.”"
2021-01-18T08:27:08Z,business,Business,Take That producer sells rights to string of early hits,"British songwriter and producer Ian Levine has sold his rights to a string of smash hits by pop group Take That to music publisher One Media iP Group. The deal covers producer royalties to tracks from the group’s 1992 debut album Take That & Party – which was certified platinum twice in the UK – including A Million Love Songs, Could It Be Magic and I Found Heaven. The company has also snapped up Levine’s rights to two other recorded Take That tracks that have never been released. One Media iP did not disclose the cost, saying only that it had acquired the rights for a “modest consideration”. Levine is the latest musician to sell his rights to investors who are on the hunt for hits that can bring in extra revenue in the new streaming era. Artists including Shakira and Fleetwood Mac members Mick Fleetwood and Stevie Nicks have also cashed in on their back catalogues, selling rights to companies including Primary Wave, Hipgnosis and BMG. Bob Dylan is believed to have struck the one of the most lucrative deals to date, having sold off publishing rights to his entire catalogue of songs to Universal Music for an estimated $300m (£221m).
Rights owners receive a cut of royalties when songs are played or covered on the radio, when they are streamed, or played in stores. They also claim income from album sales and when songs are used in TV adverts and films. The One Media iP chief executive, Michael Infante, said: “Given the current global crisis and corresponding impact on the live music sector, we have found an increasing number of artists are evaluating alternative income opportunities and are looking favourably upon our initiative. “We remain focused on building momentum and scaling the business, and look forward to keeping the market updated on our progress.”"
2021-01-17T18:19:47Z,business,Business,Eurostar warns of 'risk to survival' without government help,"Eurostar has said it is facing an existential threat, as business leaders pleaded with the government to step in and save the “vital link” with Europe. A 95% drop in passenger numbers has brought the cross-Channel train service to its knees, and the company reiterated on Sunday that while government loans had been extended to aviation, international high-speed rail had also been severely affected by the pandemic. “Without additional funding from government, there is a real risk to the survival of Eurostar … the current situation is very serious,” it said in a statement. Business leaders, including Brian Bickell, chief executive of the London landlord Shaftesbury, have written to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, urging them to save the service. Their letter repeated the warning that Eurostar could run out of funds to operate the service in and out of London St Pancras. The 28 executives said that, with the number of international tourists likely to remain low until at least the spring, the loss of the route would be a blow to the capital’s economy and the UK as a whole. Nearly four in every five passengers use the train to travel between London and Paris or Brussels.
Eurostar was “not asking for special treatment” they said, but access to the same help as companies in similar positions had received, such as business rates relief and loans. “Safeguarding the future of this connection to the continent should be a symbol of both our desire to build back better and our new cooperative relationship with our European neighbours,” the letter continued, adding: “If this viable business is allowed to fall between the cracks of support – our recovery could be damaged.” Eurostar is majority-owned by the French state railway, SNCF, but is thought to have exhausted options for governmental assistance from Paris. The franchised UK train operators that have been bailed out under emergency agreements since the coronavirus pandemic began – at a cost of £8bn this financial year – are also largely owned or co-owned by foreign state rail operators. In 2019, Eurostar carried 11 million passengers and was preparing to expand services with the introduction of direct trains to Amsterdam. It employs 1,200 people in the UK, with a further 1,500 jobs supported by its supply chain."
2021-01-17T17:20:11Z,business,Business,Next consortium in pole position to buy Philip Green's Topshop empire,"A consortium that includes high street giant Next is thought to be in pole position to buy Sir Philip Green’s Topshop empire out of administration. Arcadia, which employed 13,000 people across 500 outlets at the time of last year’s collapse, is being auctioned, with Monday being the deadline for final bids. Next, which has partnered with the US hedge fund Davidson Kempner, is pitted against Authentic Brands, the US owner of the Barneys department store, which has been linked to a joint bid with JD Sports. Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group and online retailer Boohoo have also been circling. Administrators from Deloitte hope to complete the sale by the end of this month. Arcadia, which Green bought for £850m in 2002, is home to a stable of household names including Topshop, Topman, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis, Miss Selfridge and Burton. Evans, its plus-size clothing brand, has already been hived off and sold to City Chic Collective, an Australian retailer, for £23m. Arcadia has been the biggest corporate casualty of the pandemic, which has hammered high-street retailers. The high-street closures proved to be the final straw for the group, which had suffered years of flagging sales amid heavy competition from rivals such as Boohoo and Primark. It only narrowly avoided administration in 2019 after landlords agreed rent reductions and store closures. Next’s chief executive, Simon Wolfson, has confirmed its interest in Arcadia, but said it was “only interested in the brands that we think are very, very good” and would be a minority shareholder in any new venture. If victorious, the Next consortium is expected to work with Arcadia’s existing management. Stores could be saved if landlords were willing to link rents to sales, according to the Sunday Times. The Evans deal resulted in the closure of all its outlets as the new owners plan to sell its clothing online only.
Wolfson said its involvement in Arcadia would be in similar vein to its Victoria’s Secret joint venture, where Next operates the stores and website but has no part in developing the ranges. The FTSE 100 retailer has been expanding its portfolio of brands over the past year, including through licensing deals with Ted Baker and the new owners of Laura Ashley, which also went into administration in 2020. In the wake of the BHS scandal, which saw Green eventually agreeing to pay £363m into the company’s depleted pension pot, the failure of Arcadia has thrown the spotlight on its own scheme, which has an estimated £350m deficit. The family is making a promised £50m payment a year early and has also signed over some Arcadia property assets – but it is not yet clear whether it will be enough to fill the hole."
2021-01-17T16:51:37Z,business,Business,Deliveroo secures $180m in funding as it prepares for IPO,"Deliveroo has secured another $180m (£132m) of funding from shareholders including Amazon, in a move that values the takeaway delivery company at more than $7bn as it gears up for a blockbuster stock exchange listing. Will Shu, Deliveroo’s founder and chief executive, said the London-based company would use the new cash from existing investors to improve the business for “consumers, riders and restaurants”, as he confirmed for the first time that the company was working on plans for an initial public offering (IPO). Deliveroo is among the internet firms to benefit from big pandemic-related shifts in consumer spending, and the company said the new round of investor funding had valued the company at “over $7bn”. A successful stock market flotation would complete the company’s recovery from the initial shock caused by the pandemic. Last April the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) provisionally cleared Amazon’s purchase of a 16% stake in Deliveroo after the takeaway delivery service warned it could collapse after restaurant closures during the first lockdown resulted in a “significant decline in revenues”. The cash is being spent on “new tech tools to support restaurants, provide riders with more work and extend choice for customers”, said Shu, a former investment banker who launched the business from his London flat in 2013. “We are really pleased our shareholders see the opportunity and growth potential ahead of us.” The company plans to expand its network of delivery-only kitchen sites – called “dark kitchens” – grocery delivery and subscription services, as well as allowing more restaurants to take orders via their own websites. City investors are eager to put their money into internet companies – such as the The Hut Group, which floated in September – who are benefiting from big increases in online spending. That appetite has encouraged other online companies, including the greetings card and gift retailer Moonpig, to announce plans to sell shares. Last week Deliveroo rival Just Eat said UK orders had jumped 400% in the final three months of 2020 as coronavirus restrictions kept people at home. Speaking in December, Shu said Covid-19 has accelerated consumer adoption of food delivery services by about two to three years, with order volumes in the UK and Ireland currently running at double 2019 levels. “We’ve demonstrated our model is profitable,” he said, adding that the previously loss-making company had been “profitable at the operating level for over six months now”. Shu added that the company had seen an “incredible increase in new customers joining the platform”. “We also saw our existing customers looking to order more often, also ordering for the family more frequently, we saw average basket sizes increase, and also ordering a wider range of products.” In 2019 the CMA had embarked on an in-depth investigation into Amazon’s investment in the company which it feared could leave customers, restaurants and grocers facing higher prices and lower quality services. Deliveroo did not state how much each investor had contributed in the latest funding round but Amazon’s stake has not increased as a result. The deal was formally cleared by the CMA in the summer after its probe decided it would not result in a substantial lessening of competition. • This article was amended on 18 January 2021 to clarify that the CMA did not wave through Amazon’s purchase of a 16% stake in Deliveroo in April as originally stated. It was provisionally cleared in April and given formal clearance in the summer."
2021-01-17T16:17:18Z,business,Business,Church of England to step up pressure on firms to improve diversity,"The Church of England’s investment arm is to warn companies that they must do more to protect biodiversity and increase the ethnic diversity of their senior teams or risk protest votes at upcoming shareholder meetings. The Church Commissioners, which manages the religious group’s £8.7bn fund, will start sending letters outlining their demands to some of the worst-offending companies in the fund’s investment portfolio by mid-February. The team is drawing up its benchmarks and the shortlist of companies – both public and private – that will be targeted in its new campaign. Bess Joffe, the Church Commissioners’ new head of responsible investment, said the fund would ratchet up the pressure by casting protest votes at annual shareholder meetings within months if companies fail to comply. We [want companies to] have respect for the planet and respect for the people – Bess Joffe “I think you’ll see some vote impact as early as 2021. But of course it’s not going to be taking companies off guard – we will be communicating our expectations in the next four to six weeks,” she told the Guardian. Some of the fund’s holdings, according to a list released last June, include Google’s parent firm, Alphabet, Royal Dutch Shell, Samsung, Unilever, Facebook, Tesco and AstraZeneca. That is on top of property investments including London’s Hyde Park Estate and the Metrocentre in Gateshead, near Newcastle. The body has previously voted against companies for poor climate change policies and all-male boards. Last year, it voted against members of the Prudential’s board over an “unacceptably low” number of female directors and put pressure on the energy giant Exxon over emissions disclosures. The new focus on biodiversity and ethnicity is part of a three-year ethical investment plan being crafted by Joffe’s team. “We thought about recasting the way we think about things into two broad themes, so we have respect for the planet and respect for people. And I think that fits really well with the Church’s overall mission,” she said. Joffe, a Canadian who joined from Lloyds Banking Group in August and previously held roles with Goldman Sachs and Hermes, said the shift to biodiversity was meant to encourage a holistic approach to the way companies take responsibility for protecting life on earth and enabling the planet to thrive.
“Ethnic diversity has not been a priority in any real way for companies,” she said. “They have to play their part in improving the lives of people who have been disenfranchised and left behind and who are going to suffer [disproportionately] as a result of Covid.” The UK’s biggest fund manager, L&G, has already committed to voting against all-white boards who fail to diversify their leadership teams by 2022. In February 2020, the Parker Review showed that only 178 or 6.8% of 2,625 director positions across the FTSE 350 index weren’t held by white people. Joffe and the Church Commissioners are expecting progress. “You want to be in a world where boards of directors, management teams and pipelines of talent look like the communities in which they exist,” she said."
2021-01-17T11:08:07Z,business,Business,Bobby Kennedy was right: GDP is a poor measure of a nation's health | Larry Elliott,"Next month it will be official. Figures will provide the first estimate of how much the UK economy shrank by in 2020. Depending on what happened when lockdown restrictions were temporarily eased in December, the likelihood is that there was a fall of about 10%. That will be the signal for all sorts of comparisons. Germany, which has already released data, contracted by 5% last year. Numbers for the US are not yet out but will probably show the world’s biggest economy suffered a 4%-5% drop in gross domestic product. China grew by about 2%. Historically, 2020 was a stinker for the UK – the worst year since 1709, the era of Isaac Newton, the Duke of Marlborough and Daniel Defoe. Be ready for pictures of a frozen Thames to illustrate the 15% collapse of the economy caused by the Great Frost. Does any of this matter? Looking back to the early 18th century is fun, but it was a different world back then. The UK had a population of 5 million in 1709 and the economy was largely agrarian. A 10% contraction in GDP in 2020 effectively wipes out a decade and a half of growth. A 15% drop in 1709 meant people starved to death.
There are not many memorable speeches about gross domestic product, but that may be because the one made by Bobby Kennedy while on the campaign trail in 1968 said it all. As Kennedy pointed out, the production of napalm and nuclear warheads counted towards GDP, but the health of American children and the joy of their play did not. “It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. “It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.”
Those words were true in 1968 and they resonate even more strongly today. Measured by GDP, the US is the world’s richest country. Measured by GDP per head, it is one of the richest. Measured in other ways, in life expectancy for example, the US would be a long way down the international league tables. And as recent events have shown all too clearly, it is not a country at ease with itself. Over time, people get smarter and find better ways of doing things. When economists talk about productivity, they mean that more goods and services can be delivered with less effort. Countries reap a productivity dividend, which can be taken in different ways: they can produce the same amount of stuff and have more leisure time, or they can work the same number of hours and produce more. Most European countries have tended to opt for the first option, the US for the second. Britain falls somewhere between the two. GDP measures those activities for which money changes hands or for which a monetary value can be attached. Paid childcare is included, but unpaid childcare by family members or friends isn’t. If the NHS needed to do more operations because Britain was becoming a less healthy nation, that would add to GDP. If the number of operations went down because the public exercised more, it would reduce GDP. All of which brings us back to Bobby Kennedy. What the GDP figures tell us is that the economy collapsed between late February and April, then began a recovery that picked up pace during the late spring and early summer. From then onwards, the pace of growth slackened as restrictions were tightened, culminating in a fresh fall in national output of 2.6% in November. But as a purely quantitative measure, the GDP figures tell us nothing about the quality of growth. To take one example, retail sales are now higher than they were before the pandemic started even though non-essential stores have been shut on and off for much of the past year. We know that spending has migrated from the high street and retail parks to online; what we don’t know is whether the goods being delivered by courier are really wanted or whether people are so miserable that they are binge-buying.
At present, there is much speculation about whether the UK will experience a double-dip recession – two separate episodes in which GDP falls for two or more quarters in succession. This is probably not going to happen, but even if it did, it would matter much less than some of the damage caused by the pandemic that is harder to quantify. The collapse in GDP is huge, but – unless there are fresh waves of the pandemic – only temporary. Once the restrictions are lifted, activity will pick up. If things go well, all the ground lost in 2020 will be made up by 2022. But how do you measure the impact of the schools being shut on the life chances of a child from a disadvantaged family? What price the toll on mental health of people confined to their homes and unable to see friends and family for months on end? Is it possible to put a monetary value on loneliness and depression? The fact that in recent years statisticians have tried to judge progress in different ways speaks volumes about the limitations of GDP as a yardstick. There are things that can be easily measured and things that can’t. The fact that GDP fell by 10% last year tells us something, but not everything."
2021-01-17T09:00:01Z,business,Business,Moves by Kwarteng to attack workersâ€™ rights may well run into a red wall,"Tensions inside the cabinet are emerging and the likelihood is that they are going to spark an almighty row about the government’s attitude to business. On one side are the free marketers and authors of Britannia Unchained: the 2012 manifesto for an economy stripped of burdensome regulations. In the document, Dominic Raab, Priti Patel, Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng – now in the cabinet as foreign secretary, home secretary, trade secretary and business secretary respectively – cast themselves as libertarian “freedom fighters” battling, as Margaret Thatcher once did, to cast the UK less as a donkey in the mould of Winnie the Pooh’s Eeyore and more in the image of a lithe cheetah. “The British are among the worst idlers in the world,” the authors said. “We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor. Whereas Indian children aspire to be doctors or businessmen, the British are more interested in football and pop music.” At the time they were very much outsiders, hustling to be recognised. Brexit was a central plank of their agenda, not least as a way to escape the European court of justice and its supposedly suffocating verdicts on business rules and regulations. Kwarteng, appointed to run the business department this month, has already been forced to deny that he is planning to light a bonfire under EU worker protections that Theresa May’s government transferred into UK law, such as the 48-hour maximum working week. The Financial Times said on Friday that it understood proposals to weaken rules about breaks at work, remove overtime pay when calculating certain holiday pay entitlements, and end the 48-hour week, were all part of a package under discussion inside Kwarteng’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). “We want to protect and enhance workers’ rights going forward, not row back on them,” Kwarteng insisted. But given his sympathies and friends inside the cabinet, few are likely to believe that he is doing anything more than playing for time. Ed Miliband, Labour’s BEIS spokesman, has already responded with warnings of a “deregulated race to the bottom”. Thankfully, there will probably be resistance to such moves from more pragmatic cabinet ministers such as health secretary Matt Hancock, Scottish secretary Alister Jack and possibly even Boris Johnson himself. They won’t rely so much on contesting the claims in Britannia Unchained, such as the falsehood that UK workers clock off early when all international comparisons show they worker longer hours than any in the developed world bar the US. More important will be the practical implications for the prime minister’s levelling-up agenda, which is already struggling to make any headway while the pandemic is killing record numbers of people. The “red wall” MPs – those Conservatives who won seats in previously rock-solid Labour heartlands across the north – are asking Johnson to put government support at the heart of a regeneration programme for their blighted areas. They want billions of pounds in public investment to be directed to big regional cities and towns to protect their parliamentary positions before a general election in 2024. They need improvements in transport, housing and amenities to be on show for their constituents to give credit to the Tories. They need their dilapidated high streets to be rescued and the local health and care services to be given extra cash following the pandemic. They do not need an ideologically driven battle over regulations that few in the business world see as a barrier to growth. There is also the risk the EU, fearful of the UK using Brexit to undercut regulations and export cheaper goods, will quickly retaliate. British workers, forced to work longer hours and cut off from important markets, would suffer twice. In this debate, sense must prevail. Regulations must be seen for what they are: hard-won protections for vulnerable workers, who often lack a trade union to represent their interests. Move to ban Carillion bosses is a positive step A comprehnsive list of organisations that failed at Carillion, the construction and contracting firm that collapsed three years ago this week, would include the auditors, the pensions regulator and the Crown Representative, supposedly looking out for taxpayers’ interests. Ultimately, though, corporate failures tend to start in the boardroom. It is therefore right that Kwasi Kwarteng, the new business secretary, last week launched proceedings “in the public interest” to ban eight former directors of Carillion from holding senior board posts for terms of up to 15 years. The financial details of Carillion’s failure, as set out by two select committees in 2018, were extraordinary. The collapse was “sudden and from a publicly stated position of strength”. The 2016 accounts were supposedly so healthy that £79m could be paid in dividends, plus bonuses to executives. Yet, in July 2017, the company announced an £845m reduction in the value of its contracts, rising in September that year to a £1.04bn cut – a figure equating to the previous seven years’ profits combined. When liquidation came in January 2018, liabilities stood at nearly £7bn versus just £29m in cash. This was a company employing 43,000 people, including 19,000 in the UK. One can feel a smidgeon of sympathy for the backbench non-executive directors who are included in the disqualification proceedings. They are, in theory at least, less culpable than the main figures at Carillion: Richard Howson, chief executive from 2012 to 2017; Richard Adam, the long-serving finance director; and Philip Green (not the retail tycoon), the chairman. But the proceedings are essential, even if they have been launched only belatedly. Carillion was the biggest corporate failure in a decade and left chaos in its wake. Even three years on, accountability matters. No frills, long-haul economy flights could make a comeback yet When the magnitude of the coronavirus pandemic and its effects on travel became apparent last year, the airline industry’s prognosis was bleak: only a few hardy businesses would survive the summer. Instead, as creditors, aircraft leasing companies and governments were faced with the consequences of calling in debts, the finance was found to keep airlines afloat while barely aloft. The crisis in aviation, to adapt a phrase applied to Brexit, is proving a slow engine failure rather than a sudden crash. Even Norwegian, whose finances were precarious long before Covid hit, has lurched on, zombie-like, through the pandemic. While its transatlantic Dreamliner fleet was grounded, the airline’s announcement last week that it would never fly long-haul again seemed another marker of change, not least for the 1,100 furloughed British staff who will now lose their jobs. Coronavirus has put Norwegian back into the kind of local operating realm once expected for a small Scandinavian business, before it decided to wrongfoot the wider world with a wildly ambitious expansion. A combination of the internet, globalisation, changing consumer expectations and a step-change in aircraft fuel costs created the apparent possibility for a new airline to undercut established rivals and open up a new market of no-frills transatlantic flights, for better or worse. Ironically, its full-service rival airlines’ flights are now cheaper than ever, as most potential customers are barred from travel. However, such carriers’ profits are normally sustained by business fares – the kind of travel whose future looks most likely to be ended by Zoom. If and when holidays are again allowed, fares may remain low in the short-term to attract passengers back. But more airlines may need to rethink their cabins and costs. All-economy, no-frills long-haul may yet have its day – even if Norwegian will be absent from its own feast."
2021-01-17T00:04:01Z,business,Business,A year of lockdowns can't take the shine off Goldmans Sachs profits,"What is $900m to a Wall Street giant like Goldman Sachs? Relatively little, when it counts the drop in profits for a year of record-setting market swings and economic turmoil, all sparked by a pandemic. The firm should regard itself as lucky to be poised for profits of about $7bn (£5bn) for the whole of 2020. That average analyst forecast, compiled by Refinitiv, is a mere 11% drop from the $7.9bn it made in 2019, a year when the phrase “Covid lockdown” had never been uttered. The projected decline is smaller than the $2.8bn it put aside to cover a potential jump in defaults within the first nine months of the year alone, a number estimates suggest could rise to $3.1bn for the 12 months to December. Those provisions pale in comparison with those of European peers such as HSBC, which already put by $7.6bn to cover Covid-linked loan losses by the third quarter. The bank’s results will emerge unscathed from the $2.9bn settlement it reached in October with global regulators and the US Department of Justice, over its alleged role in the 1MDB corruption scandal. The announcement came just months after Goldman agreed to pay $3.9bn to the Malaysian government, amid claims it allegedly turned a blind eye while $4.5bn was looted from the country’s sovereign wealth fund. Goldman bosses, including chairman and chief executive David Solomon, will feel the pinch of a $31m cut to their combined 2020 pay over the scandal, but hefty provisions previously put aside for the 1MDB case will largely cover the settlements.
All this means Goldman’s full-year earnings – released on Tuesday – will make headlines for less scandalous reasons. For one, its fledgling consumer bank, Marcus, has made further headway as customers lucky enough to keep their jobs or benefit from government Covid support programmes spent less and saved more during lockdowns. Marcus savings accounts were in such high demand in the UK – thanks to a pocket of cash-rich and interest-hungry savers – that in July it was forced to close to new British accounts to avoid breaching regulatory limits. But the 150-year-old lender’s bread-and-butter services will have proved its saving grace in 2020. The asset management business, fixed income division, and investment bank – which earns fees for advising clients on deals and corporate fundraising – produced a near doubling of third-quarter profit to $3.6bn. Those divisions have benefited from a recovery in merger and acquisition activity, which stalled at the start of the pandemic, and from US stock markets hitting fresh record highs in the latter half of 2020. It has given Credit Suisse a reason to be bullish on Goldman’s earnings, with that bank’s own analysts recently upgrading profit forecasts to $7.4bn. If JP Morgan’s results last Friday are any indication, the market rebound could also help Goldman beat forecasts. Its Wall Street rival reported a 42% jump in profits to $12.1bn for the fourth quarter, leaving full-year profits down 20% at $29bn. A strong performance could raise pay for Goldman traders, who are reportedly set to see 2020 bonuses rise 20% compared with 2019."
2021-01-16T19:00:40Z,business,Business,The biggest Coalition conspiracy theory is climate change denial | Greg Jericho,"Nasa announced this week that 2020 – a year which included a La Niña event normally associated with lower temperatures – was the hottest year on record. It was also the week in which the Morrison government used racist tropes to distract and excuse conspiracy statements made by its MPs.
Remember the good old days when climate change deniers would proclaim that “the world has not warmed since 1998”? Since then there have been 16 years when it has been hotter – including nine of the past 10 years.
Graph not showing? Click here Nasa confirmed what other agencies have found – last year was (depending on your measurement) either the hottest, equal hottest or close second-hottest year on record. The previous record holder, 2016, experienced a strong El Niño, which usually means it is abnormally hotter than other years. But the latter part of last year was affected by La Niña. In effect, in five years the impact of climate change has been so great that cooler years are now equivalent to previously warmer years. So, God help us when the next El Niño hits.
As it is, we are already well on our way to 1.5C and 2C above pre-20th century levels. Climate change deniers and the Morrison government (apologies for the repetition) better hope the past 10 years don’t reflect what is about to come. The trend of the past 20 years has us reaching 2C above pre-industrial averages by 2054, but if we go by the past decade, we’ll get there by 2036. Pity that the federal government is utterly bereft of the ability to face up to this. This week Australia’s acting prime minister, Michael McCormack, when asked by ABC’s Sally Sara whether Donald Trump should be removed from office before his term ends, answered that “it is unfortunate that we have seen the events at the Capitol Hill that we’ve seen in recent days, similar to those race riots that we saw around the country last year”. When he was challenged the next day he went further, referring to human rights groups as “bleeding hearts” and said that “all lives matter”. The “all lives matter” line has been used for more than five years now by racist groups and political parties to belittle and criticise the Black Lives Matter movement.
This is not a secret. Even someone of McCormack’s capacity for ignorance could not claim to be unaware of the meaning of his words – after all, just last year Pauline Hanson attempted to move a motion in the Senate that “all lives matter”. And yet, while that implication must not be ignored and let pass, we need to realise his response may have been more about deflecting from the comments made by Craig Kelly and George Christensen. Both have been variously posting unfounded claims on Facebook that the attack on the US Capitol building was done by members of “antifa”, promoting the use of unproven drugs for treating coronavirus, and pushing the conspiracy theory of “the great reset” – which falsely suggests “global elites” are using the pandemic to usher in a radical socialist or environmentalist new order. Before he went on holidays, Scott Morrison refused to criticise Christensen, and this week McCormack has done the same. It’s not surprising, for criticising Christensen and Kelly as conspiracy theorists would mean pulling on a thread that would threaten to unravel the Coalition. For it quickly leads to the granddaddy of all conspiracy theories – climate change denial. If you are calling out your members for refuting the FBI or health authorities around the world, then why are you not calling them out for suggesting the UN, Bureau of Meteorology, Nasa and government agencies around the world are involved in what would be the greatest conspiracy in history? If Morrison and McCormack start doing the right thing now, they’ll be challenged to keep doing it – and there are many more within their parties willing to push the lie of climate change denial than just Kelly and Christensen. Indeed, climate change denial remains at the core of their economic policy of more fossil fuels through a “gas-led recovery”. Alas, for them – and us – reality keeps happening and the planet keeps warming."
2021-01-16T17:00:37Z,business,Business,'Stressed' millennials are setting the agenda at work,"A snowflake millennial is tougher than you think, especially in the workplace. They have watched their parents cope with an increasingly insecure jobs market since the turn of the century and in growing numbers told their friends and family that long hours, short term contracts and a shouty boss is not for them. They don’t join trade unions or argue with the boss about a pay rise, though some do. Their confidence – however much they appear to quiver and quake – gives them the steel to quit and search for a different job that comes – they hope – without the debilitating stress that wrecks everyone’s physical and mental health. It’s why many of the world’s largest companies, keen to avoid losing their better-educated younger employees, are adopting new ways of working. Firms like Unilever, which last month said it would pilot a four day week in its New Zealand offices, know that sticking to existing work patterns when the pandemic begins to ease means stagnation at best and commercial suicide at worst. And to a great extent, Britain’s economic success rests on all employers recognising that the old-fashioned, board-knows-best, top-down ways of doing things – where the compact between worker and employer is largely a one-way commitment in the employer’s favour – are not only outmoded, they contribute to low and declining levels of worker productivity. Even those who chase jobs in the professions – architecture, engineering, medicine and the law – and kid themselves that it is worth the bullying, low wages and debt, are questioning their priorities. Cary Cooper, president of the British Academy of Management, who will give five keynote speeches in the next fortnight promoting a root and branch review of corporate life, says: “The millennials have it right. The older generation is wrong.” An adviser to governments and countless large corporations, Cooper despairs at the reliance on command and control structures that mean managers manage, mostly relying on instinct in their dealings with people, while everyone else does their bidding. He is not the only one. Like Cooper, the management consultant John Seddon has written several books on the subject and concluded that support, not control, is the answer to the problem of a dejected staff delivering barely adequate customer service. In his latest book “Beyond Command and Control” Seddon points out that two of the founding fathers of modern management thinking – Peter Drucker and Martin Bower of the consultancy Mckinsey – say their chief regret is the way public and private sector boardrooms remain devoted to top down management to the exclusion of any meaningful involvement by employees in decision making. There is a wealth of data bearing out their view that a business which involves and supports its staff is going to have a better relationship with its customers, and be more profitable. Cooper struggles to understand why companies that spend money advertising a job, employing someone and possibly spending huge sums on training, seem happy to let them walk out the door, either to another firm or to the long term sick register.
Such is the rise in work-related stress, anxiety and depression that in 2018 official figures showed for the first time that these three categories accounted for more than half of all working days lost due to ill health in the UK. Stressed millennials that get a doctor’s note are as strong as those that move jobs. Both have admitted they cannot cope when previous generations struggled on, alluding to a Dunkirk spirit that celebrates glorious failure. The generally accepted definition of a millennial is that it includes everyone born between 1981 and 1996 and so this year the first wave of millennials will celebrate their 40th birthday. There is widespread sympathy for the debts they must pay if they went into higher education and the exorbitant rent or mortgage loan repayments that weigh on their finances every month. But the jibes about their delicate disposition and obsession with self-care and self identity are equally widespread. We might not have as many pub conversations or chats over the garden fence as we did before the pandemic, but that doesn’t mean the derision has subsided. In her instructive book about Labour’s catastrophic election defeat in 2019 “Beyond the Red Wall” Deborah Mattinson documents the responses of people in Darlington, Stoke on Trent and the Manchester satellite town of Accrington to life and politics. Mostly made up of older people, the focus groups had little positive to say about young people and graduates in particular. Millennials are not going to save the country, only traditional values, say the red wallers. Yet if the pandemic is going to offer anything positive, it must be a better balance in our work lives. Traditional values in the workplace will only accelerate Britain’s steady decline."
2021-01-16T16:00:36Z,business,Business,Not-so-special delivery: how to claim for late post,"If you have experienced Royal Mail delays you may be able to claim for compensation. Letters and parcels sent by special delivery should arrive on a specific day, while first-class post should arrive the next working day after it is sent, and second-class post within three working days. Compensation for delays kicks in when your post is three or more working days late, or 24 hours late if it was sent by special delivery. You can lodge a compensation claim for lost post 10 working days after it was due to arrive, or five days for special delivery. For delays on first- and second-class post, compensation is six first-class stamps; on special delivery items compensation starts at £5 and rises to £10 if the delay goes on for seven or more working days. “There are, however, rules that mean Royal Mail does not have to pay compensation if it’s impractical or unreasonable for it to deliver an item,” says Kate Hobson at Citizens Advice. “This could be because an individual’s health and safety could be put at risk or for any other reason Royal Mail believes it would be impractical or unreasonable to deliver an item.” The person due to receive the post can make the claim, or the sender. Whoever makes the claim will need to provide details and, where possible, evidence of where the item was posted and when, which service was used and who it was posted to. “It’s usually easier for the sender to claim because they’re more likely to have the evidence that’s needed, such as the amount paid for postage, the type of postage used (eg, first class) and the contents,” says Hobson. Once your post is delayed long enough to make a claim for loss, you may be due more compensation. If the item was not sent using special delivery and has no real value – a Christmas card or postcard, for example – the limit is six first-class stamps again. If it is a more valuable item and you can provide evidence of its value and of postage, you can claim for a loss and a refund of up to £20 or £50 for Signed For mail. “If you’re unhappy with its response you may be able to escalate your complaint to the Postal Review Panel,” says Hobson. “If your complaint is unresolved you may then be able to escalate to the Postal Redress Service, but not all Royal Mail services are covered.”"
2021-01-16T16:00:35Z,business,Business,Weighty postbag of problems as Royal Mail reels from a Christmas hangover,"The image was arresting, and dispiriting. A mound of sealed Royal Mail sacks piled up in a large store room at a postal sorting centre in Bristol. Many of the items awaiting processing were doubtless Christmas presents which probably did not arrive on time. The photograph, posted by the Communication Workersâ€™ Union (CWU) on social media in the middle of December, highlighted just part of the backlog in Royal Mailâ€™s system during the festive season. The CWU published the photo to elicit support for members tackling what it said were â€œunprecedented workloadsâ€� as they tried to deliver Christmas cards, presents and surging online shopping orders during the pandemic. But Royal Mailâ€™s problems didnâ€™t disappear along with the Christmas decorations: letters and parcels are still piling up around the country. Turning around this chaotic performance will now fall to Royal Mailâ€™s new chief executive. Simon Thompson, who took up his post last week, is Royal Mailâ€™s third full-time boss in under three years. April 2018 saw the departure of Moya Greene â€“ whose eight years at the helm included the controversial privatisation of the firm â€“ and her successor, Rico Back, made a surprise exit last May. Thompsonâ€™s problem is that mail volumes remain high while Royal Mail is having to operate within social distancing requirements and cope with staff absences as workers contract Covid or have to self-isolate. Last Friday the company published a list of 31 areas which are not regularly receiving post, including Leeds, parts of Essex and east London, and some places in Bristol. This is despite it having retained around a third of its 33,000 temporary festive workers, hired 6,000 additional vehicles, and kept open four temporary parcel sorting centres.
The London School of Management Education is in Ilford, east London, one of the areas where the postal service is disrupted. Executive director Dr Ravi Kumar said the school has been hit by delays in both receiving and sending mail for a couple of months. The higher education provider uses Royal Mail to post transcripts and assessments to its 550 students, all of whom are all learning remotely. Graduation certificates posted in late November using first-class recorded delivery took between four and six weeks to arrive, Kumar said, and even now the school is only receiving post once or twice a week. Royal Mail declined to give details of Covid-related absences, but said it varied by area and added that it was working to deliver as normal a service as it could, including drawing in extra resources and offering additional overtime where possible. And the problems arenâ€™t limited to Royal Mail: social media platforms are awash with complaints about delayed or missing parcels from rival delivery firms including Hermes, DPD and Yodel. At Royal Mail, Thompsonâ€™s in-tray is full, and he will have to grapple with many of the same problems as perplexed his predecessors. The former Ocado executive, who recently worked on the NHS test-and-trace programme, is not a stranger to the postal service: he has been a non-executive director since 2017. Thompson will need to prioritise good relations with trade unions, which have clashed with Royal Mail as it tried to restructure and improve efficiency. The company finally ended a two-year dispute with workers in December, agreeing a settlement with the CWU that gives staff an above-inflation pay rise and a reduction in hours, although wider negotiations continue. Investors will be relatively content to see that Royal Mailâ€™s share price has risen by 60% in the past nine months, reaching Â£3.86, which is 17% higher than its 2013 flotation price and values the business at Â£3.8bn. Yet Thompson will be unable to reverse the terminal decline in letter writing, thanks to emails, social media and text messaging. This has accelerated during the pandemic: Royal Mail delivered 1.1bn fewer letters in the five months to the end of August than in the same period in 2019.
The company wants to focus on the more lucrative parcels business. Revenue earned from parcels overtook revenue from letters for the first time in the first half of its current financial year. But its universal service obligation requires Royal Mail to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK, at a standard price. It is edging closer to scrapping Saturday letter deliveries after Ofcom â€“ the communications regulator â€“ said this would have no significant impact on consumers. The change would save Royal Mail an estimated Â£225m a year by 2022-23. But this wonâ€™t be enough to cover its losses by 2023, according to Dr Paul Simmonds of Warwick Business School. â€œThey are fighting battles with one arm tied behind their back in the market because of the cost of meeting this universal service obligation,â€� he said. â€œThey have a great infrastructure, which they could leverage through parcel deliveries, but it is a very expensive infrastructure to be forced to maintain.â€� Online shopping orders are expected to decline once coronavirus restrictions ease and shops reopen, but few analysts expect them to drop back to pre-pandemic levels. The lockdowns have changed consumer behaviour in a way that benefits companies like Royal Mail. But in the parcel delivery market, it is competing with cheaper, leaner rivals that arenâ€™t bound by the same service obligations, and which may soon get access to the Post Officeâ€™s branch network. The decade-long exclusive partnership between Royal Mail and the Post Office ends in March; after that, customers will be able to drop packages for other courier companies off at post offices. Royal Mailâ€™s history goes back more than 500 years â€“ the onus is now on Thompson to make it a business fit for the post-pandemic world. Royal Mailâ€™s rivals
Royal Mail is still by far the largest parcel delivery company by volume in the UK, but it faces tough competition from a range of leaner, younger competitors. The company said in December it was on course to deliver more parcels in the UK in the three and a half weeks before Christmas than some of its rivals handle in an entire year. Hermes The UKâ€™s second-biggest parcel firm after Royal Mail has 5,500 full-time employees as well as a network of 27,000 couriers, who are mostly self-employed. The company handled 600 million parcels in 2020, a 50% increase on the 400 million processed in 2019. Hermes, part of the German Otto group, can trace its origins in the UK back to the 1970s, when the Grattan mail order catalogue business decided to launch its own home delivery model. DPD The parcel delivery firm announced in 2020 that it was creating 6,000 new jobs, including 3,500 drivers and 2,500 new full-time staff in depots, hubs and management positions. DPD, which handles parcels for Marks & Spencer and Asos, also announced a Â£200m investment to expand its next-day parcel delivery service. The firm, which is owned by Franceâ€™s La Poste group and operates delivery services around the world, reported a 40% rise in parcel volumes over the Christmas period compared with a year earlier. Yodel Parcel carrier Yodel is part of the multibillion-pound business empire owned by Sir Frederick Barclay and the family of Sir David Barclay, who died last week. It handles more than 160 million parcels a year, and claims a relationship with 85% of the UKâ€™s top retailers. With headquarters in Liverpool, the company runs more than 50 sites across the UK, including three sorting centres and employs 10,000 people. Yodel said it carried a record number of parcels during its peak season from 15 November to 2 January, 37% more than during the same period in 2019."
2021-01-16T12:26:52Z,business,Business,"UK aviation sector needs urgent support, industry leaders say","Industry leaders have said the UK’s aviation sector urgently needs more government support if it is to survive another lengthy period of travel restrictions, as they warn of a deepening financial crisis over the coming months. From Monday, international arrivals to the UK will be required to quarantine for 10 days, in an effort to stem the spread of any new coronavirus variants amid a worsening incidence of transmission around the world. People will also be asked to provide proof of a negative test taken in the previous 72 hours before travelling. While accepting that the curbs will protect public health, airline chiefs have said they raised the possibility airports may have to temporarily close to save costs, describing the move as “yet another huge blow” for the beleaguered sector. Karen Dee, the chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, urged ministers to set out industry-specific plans for how airports will survive financially while the stringent rules are in effect. “Airports are currently keeping their infrastructure open to support vital and critical services, such as post, freight, emergency services, military and coastguard flights, as well as to help keep the lights in the UK on through supporting flights to offshore oil, gas and wind operations,” she said. “Airports are doing so while running on empty – there is only so long they can run on fumes before having to close temporarily to preserve their business for the future. Government needs to help cover airports’ operational costs by, for example, urgently providing relief from regulatory, policing, air traffic and business rates costs in the current and the coming tax year.”
Travel corridors were hailed as a lifeline for the aviation industry after being introduced in the summer to permit people to travel to and from certain countries with low Covid-19 case numbers without having to quarantine on their return. But amid concerns about a new variant identified in Brazil, ministers have sought to calm fears by temporarily suspending them under plans that will be in place until at least 15 February. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, which represents all UK registered airlines, expressed his hopes that by Easter the restrictions would be lifted and the industry could start to recover as public demand for holidays will likely be high.
“In terms of the volume of flights that airlines are operating, we are talking about lower than 10% based on where we would normally be,” he told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Easter is a date that we have got in mind as to when we can start to have an aviation sector again because if we don’t start to bring in revenue to the sector, we are going to be in a really difficult place indeed because we have now had pretty much 12 months without any revenue coming in, which is just not sustainable and airlines are effectively staying in business by taking on billions of pounds of debt, which will need to be paid back.” The government has said it is committed to supporting the travel industry, with Robert Courts, the aviation minister, insisting a “very strong” package of measures is in place to protect the public from any new coronavirus variants. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the government was “toughening up already tough requirements” to ensure that new variants do not arrive from abroad while the vaccine is rolled out. Courts said a total ban on travel to the UK would not be the correct approach, and that pre-departure testing, passenger locator forms and the quarantine period would make the system robust."
2021-01-15T17:32:54Z,business,Business,FTSE 100 has worst week since October as fears rise over Covid fallout,"The FTSE 100 has recorded its worst week since late October as concerns increased about the economic fallout from tougher lockdown measures around the world. The index of leading UK company shares ended the week down by 138 points compared with the previous week, a fall of about 2%, at 6,735, after official figures showed the British economy edged closer to a double-dip recession in November. After a strong start to the year, gaining by about 6% since the start of January, the performance was the worst weekly decline for the FTSE 100 since the last week of October as England headed for a second national lockdown. It also comes as concerns mount over increased lockdown measures in Germany, France and China, with rising coronavirus infections denting the prospects for a rapid economic recovery at the start of 2021. The more domestically focused FTSE 250 index, which tracks the value of the 250 biggest firms outside the FTSE 100, dropped 2.2% on the week, in its worst performance since early December. The UK economy shrank by 2.6% in November, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday, as the second English lockdown pushed the country a step closer to a double-dip recession – defined as two recessions separated by a small gap – at the end of 2020. Mining companies were among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100, with Anglo American down almost 6% on Friday. Markets across Europe also ended the week lower, with Germany’s Dax losing 2% and France’s Cac down 1.9%. With more countries imposing longer Covid restrictions to contain a resurgence in the virus before vaccines can be deployed widely enough, financial markets have slipped in recent days after soaring at the start of 2021 amid optimism that the jabs could help spark a swift economic recovery.
Markets had also rallied in expectation of additional financial support for businesses and workers in the US from an incoming Joe Biden presidency, with expectations that this would spur faster growth in the world’s largest economy. Biden unveiled a $1.9tn (£1.4tn) coronavirus relief proposal on Thursday. However, stock markets had already risen over the course of several weeks in anticipation of the plan, and some analysts expect Republican opposition to some of the measures to reduce the final size of the stimulus package. Russ Mould, investment director at the Manchester-based stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “Financial markets have already priced in the good news and are now starting to worry about the negative side, namely how it will be funded. “The large scale of the proposed support measures adds fuel to the fire that taxes and interest rates will have to go up. Both have negative connotations for equities, therefore casting a cloud on the ability for stock markets to keep rallying at the same pace they have enjoyed for much of 2021.”"
2021-01-15T16:59:15Z,business,Business,UK economy shrank 2.6% in November; firms win Covid-19 insurance case – as it happened,"And finally....Britainâ€™s FTSE 100 index has posted its worst week since the end of October. The blue-chip index has fallen nearly 1% today, closing 66 points lower at 6735. That takes its losses this week to around 2%, the biggest fall since stocks surged in early November as Joe Biden won the presidential election and Pfizer reported successful vaccine trial results:
Mining stocks led todayâ€™s fallers, with Anglo American down 5.3%, Antofagasta dropping 3.6%, and BHP Group losing 3.3%. The pound has also lost ground against the US dollar, down almost one cent at $1.36, as investors move money into safer assets. European markets had their worst day since 21st December, falling around 1%, after US pharmaceutical Pfizer announced a temporary slowdown of deliveries of its COVID-19 vaccines. Predictions that Joe Bidenâ€™s stimulus package could be watered down to win Senate approval, and worries about todayâ€™s fall in US retail sales and consumer confidence, are all weighing on the markets. Neil Birrell, Chief Investment Officer at Premier Miton Investors, commented: â€œHard on the heels of the poor US employment data comes a disappointing retail sales number for December. Estimates were for it to be flat, but it fell by 0.7%. The November number was revised down as well, making it a painful year end for the retail sector. Itâ€™s hard to think that the start of 2021 will show any improvement unless Biden can get cash into peopleâ€™s pockets quickly.â€� Plus, after weeks of strong gains, investors may be keen to book profits now that Biden has proposed his $1.9bn plan:
David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Much of the gains that there achieved recently were in anticipation of Bidenâ€™s stimulus announcement. Lofty equity valuations combined with concerns that countries are going to extend their lockdowns have encouraged traders to exit the market. Pfizer said the rolling out of its vaccine in Europe will be slowed in the near-term as the pharma giant upgrades its production facility, the news is playing into the bearish move too. On Wall Street, the Dow (which hit record highs yesterday), is currently down 0.4% or 134 points at 30,857. Edward Moya of OANDA says the latest weak US economic data is worrying investors: Stocks are in the red as dealers are cutting back on their equity positions now that Bidenâ€™s relief package has been announced. It is a little worrying that retail sales fell by 0.7% in December, the all-important shopping month. The November metric was revised from -1.1% to -1.4%. In addition to that, the New York Fed manufacturing reading for January was 3.5, the lowest in seven months. Lately there has been growing evidence the US economy is cooling and todayâ€™s reports adds weight to that view. On that note, itâ€™s time to wrap up. Hereâ€™s todayâ€™s main stories:

2021-01-15T16:06:25Z,business,Business,Spanish snow storm leads to UK salad shortage,"January is a month when Britons turn to salads after the Christmas blowout. But now, on top of the disruption caused by Brexit and Covid, even the weather is conspiring against dieters by causing shortages in UK supermarkets. The supply of salad staples such as lettuce and tomatoes has been hit by Storm Filomena, the worst snowstorm to hit Spain in 50 years. It blanketed Madrid and the surrounding area and sent temperatures plummeting to record lows in Almería and Granada, two important vegetable growing regions. The bad weather has piled extra pressure on UK food retailers and suppliers at a time when they are navigating complex new post-Brexit border controls as well as coronavirus restrictions. Tesco has reported some Brexit-related “teething problems” at the main Channel crossing, through which a tenth of the food consumed in the UK is transported. However, a shortage of some salad lines in its stores is down to the recent bad weather in Spain. In January, with British produce out of season, 90% of the lettuce we eat is imported. That figure is even higher – 95% – for tomatoes and soft fruit, with Spain the primary European producer. Four years ago, the UK was gripped by a “courgette crisis” after Spanish farmers in Murcia and Valencia were badly affected by flooding, frost and snow. The disruption, which also affected tomato, lettuce and aubergine crops, resulted in soaring prices. “When it’s cold the crop effectively stops growing, so you are seeing smaller crops across Spain,” one major supermarket supplier told the Guardian. “It is a difficult time of year anyway, and then you have got to layer on Covid and Brexit.” The situation is exacerbated by the closure of restaurants and cafes, which means a record amount of food is being funnelled through supermarkets. “Demand is up again for supermarket fresh produce because food service, which has a different supply chain, is closed,” the supplier said. “So we are trying to meet increased demand against a backdrop of supply chain challenges.”
Fepex, Spain’s fresh produce export association, said the cold weather would reduce crop yields in Almería and Granada, meaning lower volumes of tomatoes, cucumbers, courgettes, eggplant and peppers. January is one of the important months of the year, when Spanish farmers export between 1.2m and 1.3m tonnes of fruit and vegetables. The intense cold could have caused irreparable damage, Fepex said in update on its website. “In the field, farmers do not have enough kilos to collect, and not enough product enters the warehouses to supply all orders.” A fall in production usually pushes up prices but there may not be enough supply to satisfy even existing commercial agreements. However, growers in other Spanish regions have fared better, said Luke King, the commercial director at organic vegetable box company Riverford, which sources from farmers in Murcia and Andalusia. “Don’t get me wrong, the weather has been horrible, it’s been cold, it’s been wet … which is not good growing conditions and logistics can get compromised but we’ve not had any issues.”"
2021-01-15T14:32:28Z,business,Business,Covid insurance ruling: the business owners who will now get paid,"The guesthouse owner Gary Lovatt, who runs the five-bedroom Laurel Bank guesthouse in Keswick in the Lake District, said he was “very happy” with the supreme court verdict, and “reasonably confident” he would now get a payout from his insurer. Lovatt had tried to claim between £10,000 and £15,000 on his insurance policy after he was forced to close, but said he did not get very far because of his insurer’s “computer says no” approach.
Asked how much income he had lost, the 61-year-old said it was more than 50%. He said that for a lot of small businesses, the loss of cashflow is a huge issue. “They haven’t got the resources that the large companies [have].” Lovatt added: “The amounts, to the insurance companies, are quite small – they’re small beer… With a £5,000 claim, that could [pay] someone’s mortgage for six to eight months.” With these policies generally, Lovatt said the maximum amount someone could claim over a period of perhaps 24 months was about £20,000. A member of the board of directors of the Federation of Small Businesses, Lovatt said that after being told by his insurer, Argenta, that the policy’s business interruption wording did not cover him, he started “gathering the evidence. Then the FCA decided to take it up.” Rupert Jones The marketing agency owner
Simon Young made a claim with insurer Hiscox in March 2020 for his marketing agency Institution. His firm has stayed open during the pandemic, but some of the 12 staff have been furloughed, and the Doncaster office is out of use. Responding to the supreme court judgment, Young said: “That’s fantastic. The cynic in me says how does this now play out, and when will we actually get paid?” He added: “When I took out the policy I never envisaged this would happen – it was more for if there was a fire at our building, or something like that. I thought it would pay out for not being able to use the office, and to provide a level of income while we were closed due to unforeseen circumstances.” The pandemic seemed to be just that, and in the early days of the crisis Young contacted Hiscox and was told it was investigating what would happen to policies. Later he was told that his claim was on hold while the court case was heard. Since then there have been occasional updates from the insurer, but nothing more. Young said a successful claim would be worth “tens of thousands of pounds” to his business, and help support jobs. “I am lucky – I’m not reliant on the claim coming through, but I think of the people who have lost their businesses over the past year, or need this to keep going.” Hilary Osborne"
2021-01-15T14:06:59Z,business,Business,Trump saw the economy was his ticket to a second term – then Covid struck,"No time to waste. That was the message from Joe Biden as he announced plans for a $1.9tn (£1.4tn) stimulus package only days before his inauguration as US president next week. Combatting the health and economic crises he will inherit from Donald Trump will be top of the agenda for his administration. The latest jobs figures highlight the problem. In the latest week, the number of new unemployment claims rose by 181,000 to 965,000, the highest weekly figure since August. Record Covid-19 infection rates during the winter months have led to curbs on activity being strengthened, partly as a result of action by individual states and partly because individuals have become more cautious. As a result, growth has slowed and the improvement in the labour market that followed the initial pandemic shock last spring has gone into reverse. Biden has some experience of this sort of situation because the economy was in similarly poor shape when he became Barack Obama’s vice-president in 2009. Certainly, the economy Trump bequeaths to Biden bears no comparison to the one left to him by Obama. Trump had seen the economy as his ticket to a second term. At last year’s World Economic Forum in Davos he told assembled members of the global elite: “America is thriving, America is flourishing, and yes, America is winning again like never before.” Most incumbents tend to be re-elected. Before Trump, the only presidents since the the second world war to have won one election but not a second term were Jimmy Carter and George Bush senior. Sitting presidents who preside over even a moderately well-performing economy tend to win with some ease. And that’s the way it looked like panning out for Trump when he pitched up in Davos. At that point, with unemployment at its lowest since the US was first putting men on the moon in the late 1960s, few would have put much money on Biden capping a long political career with the presidency. Trump’s determination to focus on the economy meant he downplayed the seriousness of the virus and action to prevent its spread was delayed. But by March, businesses were closing, unemployment was threatening to return to the levels of the 1930s and the markets were crashing. As a result, the economy under Trump was divided into two parts: the generally successful first three years followed by a disastrous 2020. By the time he lost to Biden in early November, the US had actually recovered most of the ground lost during the early stages of the pandemic but by then it was too late. In Trump’s first three years in office, growth averaged 2.5% – a solid if by no means exceptional performance. Despite Trump’s assertions, the US economy had been growing steadily under Obama from the middle of 2009 onwards, with an average annual expansion of 2.25% a year. If the big boost to defence spending under Trump is put to one side, the growth rates under the last two presidents would be pretty much identical – up to the end of 2019 at least. Figures are not yet in for 2020 but the US looks to have contracted by about 4.5%. The jobs picture looks similar. Under Obama, the jobless rate had more than halved and it was assumed by the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve, America’s central bank, that it could go no lower without inflation picking up. Trump was sceptical about this view and was proved right. Unemployment continued to fall, reaching 3.5% by the end of 2019.
The number of jobs created each year was slightly slower than in Obama’s second term, but a tighter labour market meant firms had to pay higher wages and offer jobs to those who had previously found it hard to find work, such as those with poor skills or disabilities. The black unemployment rate fell below 6% for the first time since modern records began in the early 1970s. Real household median income – one guide to living standards – rose by $6,000 in the first three years of Trump’s presidency. In the previous decade and a half it had gone up by little more than $250.
These trends ended abruptly with the onset of the pandemic. The unemployment rate surged to 14.7% and while the trend is once again downwards, at 6.7%, the jobless rate is still almost double its pre-crisis level. There are about 5 million more people unemployed than when Trump came to office. All of which opens up a new chapter in the “what if” school of history. What if the election last November had been held a year earlier? What if the battle for the presidency had been put back a year to November 2021? Would the result have been different? The fact that the election was so close suggests it might well have been. Trump secured almost 47% of the vote and would be on course for a second term had a few thousand members of the public in a handful of swing states switched their votes to him. But he could not prevent Covid-19 from causing serious damage to the economy and he could not delay polling day. Had he accepted defeat gracefully, Trump might have been viewed as a president who, with the benefit of vaccines and the expected strong recovery in 2021, could have turned things round for an autumn election. He might have been seen as an unlucky president rather than a bad loser."
2021-01-15T13:46:53Z,business,Business,'How many more lockdowns can we go through?' Bosses on Covid double-dip recession,"The UK economy shrank by 2.6% in November, as a second national lockdown in England and tough restrictions across the rest of the UK hit growth. The Guardian has spoken to three company bosses about the pressure they and their employees are facing as the second wave of the pandemic threatens to tip the British economy into a double-dip recession. Urban Village Pubs, London Business planning has become almost impossible for Ian Grundy, the founder of Urban Village Pubs, as the November lockdown and rapid changes to the government’s coronavirus restrictions have cost his business more than £1.5m in the past year alone. “As we got to autumn and the tier system raised its head, effectively life became quite difficult. Not least because the rules changed every week as the government spun the bottle and decided what restrictions came out that week. It’s just become impossible to plan,” said Grundy. The second English lockdown meant his latest venture, the Rookwood Village in Leytonstone, east London, opened for 72 days only in 2020, after his firm bought the derelict Victorian pub and invested thousands of pounds to reopen it in July for the first time since 2013. This was at least a little better than the first lockdown, just after Grundy bought it, when builders had just four hours on-site before it was boarded up again. With eight pubs dotted across London’s suburbs and the south of England, Urban Village started operating takeaways to help maintain its presence. The money has helped, but does not cover fixed costs, despite support from the furlough jobs scheme and government-backed loans. Grundy feels hospitality is being unfairly targeted by lockdowns and needs urgent state support to prevent pubs closing for good this year. “Rishi [Sunak] is saying: ‘Oh well I’ll make another announcement at budget in March,’ but you can’t run a business like that. We have no idea what we’re looking at and have possibly no income for the next three to five months. What we need now is the government to step up and enable us to plan for what happens.” Regent hotel, Doncaster
The November lockdown was tough for the Regent hotel in Doncaster after a year when 38 weddings had to be moved or refunded and crowds were banned from the final days of the town’s St Leger horse racing festival.
“No one is travelling, there are no salesmen on the road, and no one to visit, so everyone’s more or less on lockdown,” said the hotel’s owner, Simon Longworth. But unlike the spring of last year, when activity stopped entirely amid a rash of cancellations, the family firm started selling takeaway meals from its a la carte restaurant to help it survive. “We said we’re not going to let this beat us, we need to be on the front foot.” With fewer travellers during the pandemic, Longworth, whose family has run the business since 1935, has now converted 20 rooms into rental apartments to maintain a steadier flow of income. But although selling takeaways has helped, it barely makes up for the loss of the hotel’s usual trade in the run-up to Christmas. Far from the 200 usual restaurant covers on Christmas Day, the hotel sold 78 meals at a third of the price, delivered to homes across Doncaster. “Obviously we were looking forward to Christmas. And come the second lockdown, certainly in Doncaster we were hoping we’d get some kind of reprieve to allow us to open in December to keep us going. If we could’ve had a week or so of that, that would’ve been great. But it was not to be,” said Longworth. “It’s a balancing act of how many more lockdowns can we go through and walking away from a business that’s been in the family for 85 years?” Crow Wood Leisure, Burnley Crow Wood health spa on the outskirts of Burnley has been losing £250,000 for every month it is forced to close by the government. With tough restrictions in place for longer in east Lancashire than most other places in the UK, the November lockdown only added to the challenge of staying afloat for Andy Brown, whose family has run the business for 20 years. “We were under tier 3 and London was in tier 1, everyone all carrying on going to the pub and restaurants, we were locked down. It’s been horrendous. The whole levelling up agenda is, I’m afraid, just not there at all,” he said.
“We’ve lost about £7m in revenue. But it could be more – we’re not through it are we? We’ve still no indication of when we can open for business, when we might be able to open a bit, or at all.” With almost 300 employees, and not operating takeaways from its three restaurants, the only revenue source is football, when top-flight football teams stay at Crow Wood’s 78-bedroom hotel when they have fixtures against Premier League Burnley or Championship Blackburn or Preston. “Otherwise we’re dead; we’re shut,” said Brown. Brown, who has questioned Sunak on calls arranged for local business leaders by the British Chambers of Commerce, said the government needed to be clearer with its lockdown plans and provide more help for companies. “I’m not sure we can prepare for reopening yet to be honest, as we’ve been in this situation so many times over the last 10 months. You can’t trust anything Boris [Johnson] says.”"
2021-01-15T09:37:15Z,business,Business,The Gym Group reports 48% revenue fall under Covid lockdowns,"The Gym Group, one of Britain’s largest operators of low-cost gyms, has opened talks with lenders after reporting that revenues almost halved last year and member numbers plunged by more than 200,000 due to the pandemic. The company, which runs 184 gyms across the UK, said revenues fell by 48% year on year from £153m to £80.5m as pandemic restrictions across the UK cost it 45% of trading days last year.
The company, which on Friday announced that former footballer and TV pundit Rio Ferdinand was to join its board as a non-executive director, has opened talks with its lenders as the latest national lockdown stretches its finances. The company said that while its has “significant liquidity” with its £100m banking facility, it needed to extend the financial covenants. Net debt stood at £47m at the end of last year. “Given the ongoing impact from the latest lockdown and its implications for the operational reopening of our gyms, we have started discussions with our lending banks, who continue to be supportive, to review the future covenant tests relating to this facility,” the company said. The Gym Group said that as of the end of 2020 membership numbers had fallen by more than a quarter year on year, from 794,000 to 578,000. The company, which froze gym subscriptions during the national lockdown so members don’t pay while sites are closed, added that it had no students members remaining from its 2019 sign ups. The average monthly headline price for a membership was £18.81 in December.
“2020 has been a challenging year for our business, our members and our colleagues,” said Richard Darwin, the chief executive. “Our cash management during the pandemic has ensured we ended 2020 with manageable levels of debt and significant liquidity. At a time when health and fitness has never been more important to the nation, we are ready to emerge from the pandemic and take advantage of the many opportunities available to us.” The company said the monthly cash burn during the current lockdown was running at £5m, lower than the £6m during the November lockdown due to the recent government grant support.
Despite the pandemic the company recently opened its 184th site, and a total eight new venues last year and is progressing on three more. The group said the pandemic had also provided opportunities to snap up locations with cheap rentals as the pressure mounted on high street landlords. “The company continues to see an opportunity to access excellent new sites at attractive rents,” it said. “We are building a strong pipeline for 2021 and beyond, and we will continue to progress new leases during this current period of lockdown. We will determine the timing of the rollout programme once there is greater visibility about a reopening date for gyms.”"
2021-01-15T09:27:49Z,business,Business,Why the GDP hit from UK lockdown 2.0 was smaller than expected,"When the UK first went into lockdown last spring the impact on the economy was swift and profound. National output dropped by almost a fifth in April. There was an echo of that decline in activity in the November figures for gross domestic product released by the Office for National Statistics but a relatively faint one. The 2.6% monthly contraction was bad – especially for consumer-facing businesses – but not nearly as bad as it might have been. Britain’s economy was 8.9% smaller in November than in the same month of 2019, but analysts were braced for an annual decline of more than 12%.
Why was the drop smaller than expected? For a start, more of the economy remained open in November than it did during the first lockdown. Factories kept turning out goods, construction work was allowed, children continued to go to school. In addition, a couple of one-off factors supported activity. One was that the knife-edge state of trade negotiations between the UK and the EU encouraged firms to stockpile as insurance against a no-deal outcome. A second was that there was a delay between England’s lockdown being announced and the restrictions coming into force, which allowed people to do some early Christmas shopping or have a meal out.
But as Paul Dales, the UK economist at Capital Economics has noted, the UK has built up some immunity to lockdowns. Firms have found ways of doing business despite the restrictions, such as providing click-and-collect services. Consumers don’t stop spending when the shops are shut: they simply shop online.
The current lockdown will cause more damage to the economy than that in November because the restrictions are tougher and will be in place for longer. As Rishi Sunak noted, the news will get worse before it gets better, but the vaccination programme means the likelihood is that restrictions will be gradually eased from next month onwards. The expectation in the financial markets is that a solid recovery will be under way by the spring. In the meantime, there is the question of whether the UK will have a double-dip recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of falling output. GDP will almost certainly contract in the current quarter, but the better than feared figures for November suggest growth might just have remained positive in the fourth quarter of 2020. According to Dales, GDP would need to fall by 1% in December for the economy to shrink in the fourth quarter as a whole. It is touch and go, but a double dip might just be avoided."
2021-01-15T07:11:31Z,business,Business,UK edges towards double-dip recession as GDP falls 2.6%,"The UK economy has edged towards a double-dip recession after official figures confirmed a renewed slump in November fuelled by the second national coronavirus lockdown in England.
The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product (GDP) had fallen by 2.6% month-on-month in November, when the government forced the closure of non-essential shops and the hospitality sector in England to combat rapid growth in Covid infections, and as tougher controls in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland weighed on growth. Reflecting the renewed controls amid the second wave of the pandemic, the latest official figures end six consecutive months of growth over the summer, when the UK economy was recovering from the first wave of the crisis. The impact of renewed restrictions took GDP in November down to 8.5% below its pre-pandemic level, in a setback for Britain’s economic recovery from the first wave of the crisis. GDP fell by 3% in the first three months of 2020 and plunged by 19% in the second quarter during the first lockdown – the biggest decline in history and plunging the UK into recession, which economists regard as two consecutive quarters of falling GDP. Growth returned in the summer with a record 16% rise in the third quarter. After the decline in November, some economists believe GDP could fall in the final quarter of 2020 and expect a further decline in the first three months of 2021 amid tougher lockdown restrictions, which would put the UK back in recession.
James Smith, research director of the Resolution Foundation, said: “The sharp GDP fall in November as England entered its second national lockdown suggests that the UK is in the midst of a double dip recession as it starts the year with even stricter restrictions. “But while the economic story today is of only the second-ever double-dip recession on record, the story of the year will be a vaccine-driven bounceback in economic activity for sectors like hospitality and leisure.” However, the November drop in GDP was not as bad as feared, after economists polled by Reuters had predicted a 5.7% fall, which could mean Britain ultimately avoids the first double-dip recession since the 1970s. Philip Shaw of the City bank Investec said: “It would take a monthly drop in GDP of 1.0% or more in December to cause a contraction in the fourth quarter. The much awaited double-dip recession may not happen and our inclination right now is that it will not.” According to the latest figures from the economy, pubs and hairdressers suffered the biggest impact during the second English lockdown in November, as the hospitality sector was forced to close or operate as takeaway-only. The service sector – which includes activities such as retail, hospitality and finance, and is typically the growth engine of the British economy – shrank by 3.4%, leaving output about 10% below pre-pandemic levels. However, the ONS said many firms adjusted to the new working conditions during the pandemic, schools stayed open, and manufacturing and construction generally continued to operate, meaning the economic damage was significantly smaller in November than during the first lockdown. Industrial production – which includes manufacturing, as well as energy production – fell marginally, by 0.1%, while keeping building sites open boosted the construction sector with 1.9% growth on the month, taking output back above pre-pandemic levels. Analysts said many companies had adapted well to the November lockdown in England. After Boris Johnson gave a lengthy notice period for the lockdown, which started on 5 November and lasted until 2 December, the first few days of the month were also been among the busiest days of the year for some companies, as consumers rushed to shops, pubs and restaurants before they closed. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is under renewed pressure to provide additional financial support to businesses and workers struggling at the start of 2021 during the third national lockdown in England, as the cumulative impact of almost a year living through the pandemic takes its toll.
Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, said the UK had already had the worst recession of any major economy earlier in 2020 and was in danger of a “devastating double dip”. “That’s the cost of this Conservative government’s incompetence and indecision. Instead of securing our economy, the chancellor is winding down economic support and hitting families with a triple hammer blow of pay freezes, a cut to universal credit and a hike in council tax,” she said. Sunak said it was clear that “things will get harder before they get better” and that the latest official figures underscored the challenge facing the country. He added: “But there are reasons to be hopeful – our vaccine rollout is well under way and through our ‘plan for jobs’ we’re creating new opportunities for those most in need. With this support, and the resilience and enterprise of the British people, we will get through this.”"
2021-01-15T00:01:21Z,business,Business,Sunak under renewed pressure to give firms more Covid support,"Rishi Sunak is coming under renewed pressure to provide more financial support to businesses across the UK, as official figures confirmed the UK is heading for a double-dip recession. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said the chancellor needed to launch a new package of cash grants, and extend and expand a range of tax cuts to help businesses struggling to stay afloat while tougher coronavirus restrictions were in place. Calling for immediate action, the business lobby group said firms could not afford to wait until the budget on 3 March, which Sunak has indicated will be the next date when he refreshes the government’s pandemic response. Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Friday showed the UK economy contracted again in November, when Boris Johnson staged a last-minute decision to impose a second English lockdown to contain rapid growth in Covid infections. The economy shrank by 2.6% in November compared with October, ending six successive months of growth in the summer as rising infections and tougher restrictions across the UK pushed the economy into a double-dip recession. Economists had forecast a bigger fall in GDP of 5.7% in November. GDP fell by 19% in the second quarter during the first national lockdown – the biggest decline in history. The impact this time is expected to be felt most by the embattled hospitality sector. Pubs, restaurants and cafes were forced to close or operate as takeaway-only during the second lockdown in England, while more non-essential shops remained open than during the first, and manufacturing and construction activity continued. Britain’s biggest pub and restaurant groups recorded a 72.6% drop in sales over the pivotal Christmas period, according to figures published on Friday by the Coffer Peach business tracker, in what should have been the sector’s most profitable time of year. Trading figures for the five weeks to 3 January showed drink-led pubs and bars were worst hit, with total sales down by more than 80% on the same period a year ago. London, which had been largely open at the beginning of December, fared slightly better than the rest of the country as tougher restrictions were in place in the north of England under the tiering system. However, sales in the capital were still down 66.8% on a year ago, compared with a 73.9% decline outside the M25. Paul Newman, the head of leisure and hospitality at the accountancy firm RSM, which produces the tracker alongside the data provider CGA and Coffer Group, a leisure industry specialist, urged the chancellor to step in quickly. “Urgent clarity on substantial, additional government support is needed now as the 3 March budget may simply be too late. The chancellor’s latest grant package does not go far enough, barely touching the fixed monthly site costs that businesses face,” Newman said. Tighter since Christmas restrictions are expected to trigger an even bigger drop in economic output in January, as stay-at-home orders and school closures further weight on growth. The interventions come after Sunak announced £4.6bn in new grants for firms in the hardest-hit sectors of the economy last week. The furlough scheme – which has been used to subsidise the wages of more than 9m jobs at more than 1m companies since its launch, at a cost of more than £46bn so far – has also been extended until the end of April. However, business leaders said companies needed a further year of business rates relief and an extension of the 5% reduced VAT rate for hospitality firms owing to the cumulative hit from multiple lockdowns.
Adam Marshall, the director general of the BCC, said government support schemes had saved many firms and jobs, but they had not gone far enough to help many survive a tough start to 2021. “The drip-feed approach to business support measures has meant many firms simply cannot plan for the future,” he said. “We are urging the government to urgently adopt a package of measures that covers the whole of 2021, and that takes away the cliff-edges firms face in a few weeks’ time when reliefs, forbearance and furlough are set to end. Many companies simply can’t wait until the March budget. Action is needed now.” A Treasury spokesperson said more than £280bn had been spent by government to support jobs and businesses during the pandemic, adding: “As the chancellor set out this week, the budget is the most appropriate interval to consider what further interventions may be necessary, given these schemes now extend through to the spring.”"
2021-01-14T21:00:50Z,business,Business,Boohoo requires an agent of change to help with its makeover | Nils Pratley,"Is everything now tickety-boo at Boohoo? Certainly there was no sign of a consumer boycott after last year’s revelations of shoddy practices in clothing factories in Leicester. Sales in the UK rose 40% in the last four months of 2020. The teenage customers did not rebel. Perhaps they were too distracted by TikTok to read the newspapers. Boohoo can also boast about making “significant progress” on its “agenda for change” programme, its attempt to improve poor practices on pay and working conditions in its supply chain. The saintly Sir Brian Leveson is overseeing the operation; a new non-executive is chairing the audit committee; and a risk committee has been constituted. And 64 suppliers in the UK have been ditched, a number that illustrates the depth of problems that built up over the years. But there was an intriguing line in Leveson’s first report, published alongside the trading update: “With nine different brands, encouraged to differentiate themselves, it is perhaps inevitable that there are differing views among leaders of companies and departments in the group as to the meaning to them of the agenda for change”. Differing views? Does that mean a chunk of Boohoo’s management thinks cleaning up the supply chain gets in the way of selling cheap clothes? That would be a natural reading. Leveson’s recommendation was gentle: “A clear explanation of what the programme involves and how it affects the entire business is therefore essential.” OK, the bigger question is surely who at Boohoo should be leading the reform effort. Mahmud Kamani, Boohoo’s co-founder and chairman, may be 100% signed up to the programme but, since the company got itself into this mess under his leadership, his credibility as an agent of change is not strong. Kamani owns only 12.5% of Boohoo’s shares, so his position is not as commanding as some founders’. Outside shareholders ought to be capable of insisting on having an independent chair, as the company once had, leaving Kamani to concentrate on his day-to-day retailing duties, which is where his strengths lie. Why don’t they insist? One suspects the answer is their own distraction – a Boohoo share price that has fully recovered. Come on, though, that’s not an excuse. An independent chairman should still be a minimum demand. Budget long-haul a flight too far for Norwegian Norwegian Air Shuttle wasn’t the pioneer of budget transatlantic air travel, but it lasted longer than most predecessors in the high-risk business of selling tickets to New York for as little as £150. In that sense, Norwegian’s decision to axe long-haul flights is not merely a blow for staff, including 1,100 crew and cabin staff at Gatwick, where the airline was once the third-largest operator. It is also a setback for competition when the pandemic passes. IAG, the owner of British Airways, found Norwegian such an irritant that it offered to buy it in 2018. One cannot, though, really blame Covid for Norwegian’s troubles. Even before the pandemic, the company had too much debt, too many leasing liabilities and too many unprofitable routes. The Oslo government’s reluctance to get involved in a bailout was understandable. In slimmed-down European form, Norwegian has greater hope of finding funding for its latest refinancing proposal. But the supply of budget flights to the US, one suspects, may never come back in the same way.
We shall overcome, Tesco says of Brexit red tape Some complaints about Brexit red tape are more serious than others. The challenges faced by some small Scottish fishing companies, now facing more delays until exports to the EU can resume, are definitely severe. The stock is perishable and the anger being directed at the government, including from Conservative MPs representing fishing areas, is justified. Marks & Spencer’s long tale of woe last week about a shortage of Percy Pigs sweets in its Irish stores did not stir the same emotions. No doubt the paperwork required to navigate “rules of origin” regulations is complex, as Steve Rowe, M&S’s chief executive, grumbled. But compare M&S’s tone with Tesco’s can-do attitude to such issues on Thursday. “We see this as a challenge that needs to be overcome and resolved … but we don’t see it as a crisis,” said the chief executive, Ken Murphy. Both retailers were among the firms that wrote to the government last week to highlight problems, but also you have to wonder whether some big firms were better prepared for bureaucracy."
2021-01-14T17:34:26Z,business,Business,Minister steps up pressure on UK firms over home working,"The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has said companies must redouble efforts to ensure employees work from home unless their work is critical and cannot be done offsite, as the TUC urged the government to step up enforcement. Calls are growing for the government to rethink allowing construction sites to continue as normal and to permit only those whose operations are vital, with several industry employees telling the Guardian that safe practice has become impossible on sites. The government is preparing to ramp up warnings to employers that they must ensure they are making every effort to keep employees at home. Speaking to the Guardian, Kwarteng said there were “deeply troubling” reports of some businesses’ tactics to get employees into the office. “The vast majority of businesses have moved heaven and earth to protect the health and welfare of workers in what has been a truly difficult year,” he said. “However, recent reports that a small minority of firms have threatened employees with unpaid leave unless they come into the office are deeply troubling.” Kwarteng, who took over Alok Sharma’s brief in the business department after Sharma was made full-time president of Cop26, is understood to have repeatedly stressed the need for home working in introductory calls with business leaders over recent days. “The scientific evidence is clear that the next few weeks will be a critical time of the pandemic, so we need all employers to act responsibly and take every possible step to enable and support their staff to work from home,” he said. “The law is also clear that people must work from home unless they cannot reasonably do so. With the vaccine rollout accelerating, the end is in sight. But in the meantime it is vital everybody plays their part to protect our NHS and save lives – and I want to see British businesses leading from the front.” In the latest data released by the Office for National Statistics, 51% of the UK workforce were working at their normal place of work and 32% were working remotely. In April last year during the first lockdown, 46.6% of people said they were at least partially working from home. According to the ONS, the proportion of the workforce on furlough was 14%, roughly half the figure in mid-May. The data covers two weeks up to 27 December, and so not the current national lockdown in England. On Wednesday, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, voiced concern about the number of people travelling on weekdays, revealing that Department for Transport data showed road traffic in Britain at 63% of pre-pandemic levels and bus usage outside London at 26%. It suggests car usage has almost doubled since the first lockdown, when it was about 32%, and bus usage has more than doubled. The problem appears particularly pronounced in London, where the most recent Transport for London data suggests tube travel is more than three times higher than in the spring lockdown. Underground journeys were at 17% of normal demand on Wednesday, compared with 5% in mid-April, and bus journeys were at 30% of normal demand. The City of London Corporation urged workers in the Square Mile to report their bosses if they are being forced or pressured to come into work. Its health and environment committee chair, Keith Bottomley, said firms should “think carefully about whether they truly need to be at their workplace”. Recruitment firms have been among the worst offenders, accounting for nearly a quarter of the 16 complaints lodged with the corporation against office-based firms since Christmas. Employers have given a raft of excuses for breaching guidelines, including that some staff are new, need supervision and therefore cannot work remotely. The corporation said none of the complaints were linked to overcrowding in offices, but stressed that businesses must take “every possible step” to allow staff to work remotely during the health crisis. “Extra consideration should be given to those people at higher risk,” it said. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said it was time for the government to step up enforcement of home working and safe workplaces. She said: “With fewer people working from home than in the March lockdown, it is more important than ever that workplaces are safe, not breeding grounds for Covid-19. But many workers are still being forced to work indoors without adequate ventilation or proper social distancing from colleagues or customers. The government must urgently update the rules to keep pace with the latest science on the spread of the virus.” O’Grady said it was staggering that not one company had been prosecuted and fined for breaching official safety guidance. “Rather than lecturing the public on non-compliance, ministers should be cracking down on bosses who play fast and loose with workers’ safety,” she said. Construction sites and estate agents have been among the workplaces where MPs and unions have raised concern about staff. Responding to a Guardian callout, one estate agent working for a major firm said it was appalling that the property market was fully open. “The government’s stance is to stay home and not to go out unless it’s vital. How is browsing homes vital at this time?” the estate agent said. “Many agents and staff are concerned about getting infected but they can’t stay home as the government is allowing them to work, so no furlough. I know that would mean me losing money but I care about the situation.” A West Yorkshire site manager for one of the UK’s largest construction companies said senior managers were able to work safely from home while putting staff safety at risk. “I have had to send workers home who have come to work trying to hide symptoms as they do not want to miss out on pay,” the site manager said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Projects have been brought forward to take advantage of the quieter roads, because we should be staying at home. Because of the mixed messaging the construction workers have received, there is definite complacency on sites … construction workers are being told to go to work, keep apart where you can and not to wear face coverings the majority of the time.” Another construction project manager wrote to the Guardian on Monday saying their work continued at pre-Covid levels, with 500 people on site, mask-wearing discouraged and no adequate ventilation. “Many are low-paid, with no job security and no incentive to self-isolate or report symptoms for fear of loss of income,” they said. “The job is for a major developer that can well afford to delay the completion of the project.”"
2021-01-14T17:10:19Z,business,Business,Tesco posts record Christmas sales; US jobless claims jump – as it happened,"Time to wrap up. Tesco has emerged as a Christmas winner, on a busy day for UK retailersâ€™ financial results. The supermarket giant grew its UK like-for-like sales by 8.1% over Christmas, but also reported that the cost of Covid-19 have risen to around Â£810m. Analysts said Tesco was well-positioned for 2021, although its banking service and its Booker wholesale divisions both suffered from the pandemic. Bike and motor business Halfords, and online musical instrument seller Gear4Music, also posted strong results -- but Primark faces losing at least Â£1bn in lost sales from the lockdown.
The US jobs market has deteriorated again, with over one million people filing new jobless claims last week. The initial claims total surged to 965,000, while another 284,000 self-employed people sought help through the PUA scheme. Economists and investors said the figures showed the US economy needs more help.
Stocks have risen to record levels on Wall Street, as investors anticipate Joe Biden pushing through a huge stimulus programme. Shares in UK travel companies also rose, on reports that over-50s were booking trips abroad in preparation for being vaccinated against Covid-19.

Germanyâ€™s economy has suffered its worst year since 2009, with GDP falling 5% during 2020. Economists said Europeâ€™s largest economy had coped relatively well, but is likely to shrink again this quarter as lockdown measures continue to be enforced.

2021-01-14T16:05:04Z,business,Business,Boohoo sales spiked in run-up to Christmas despite poor working practices concern,"Sales at Boohoo jumped 40% in the run-up to Christmas as shoppers shrugged off the association of the online company with poor working conditions in clothing factories in the UK and overseas. The bumper sales came as Sir Brian Leveson, the retired judge overseeing a clean-up of the retailer’s supply chain, said the process had a “long way to go”. Boohoo, which owns nine fashion brands including Pretty Little Thing and Karen Millen, said it had enjoyed growth “across all brands and geographies”. Overall sales increased by 40% to £661m in the four months to 31 December.
John Lyttle, Boohoo’s chief executive, said the firm had expanded its share in all its markets, with the strong Christmas figures leading it to increase its top estimate of full-year growth to 38%, up from a previous estimate of 32%. Boohoo’s UK sales matched the overall growth figure, but its performance in the US was stronger; sales were up 51%. Like its rival Asos, the company is benefiting from the growth of online shopping during the Covid-19 pandemic, which has forced high-street stores to close. With the break-up of Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia group signalling the end of an era for the high street, Boohoo has emerged as a new force, having recently rescued the Oasis and Warehouse brands. To handle the big increase in sales, the company will this April open a new UK warehouse in Wellingborough that will create 1,000 jobs. However, Boohoo’s success has been overshadowed by concerns about worker abuse in some of the factories used by its suppliers. Last year an investigation by the Guardian found that factories in Leicester making the company’s clothes were failing to pay workers the minimum wage and were putting the health of staff at risk during lockdown. Leveson, who led the inquiry into the activities of the media, was drafted in following a damning independent review, which found that media reports of poor conditions in the company’s supply chain were “substantially true”. To remedy the situation, Boohoo has embarked on an “agenda for change” programme which, among other things, promises to overhaul its use of garment manufacturing in the UK. It hired Leveson to “bring transparency and independence to the process”, which involves other independent organisations, including ethical audit and compliance specialists. The first of Leveson’s updates was published by the company alongside today’s numbers. Leveson said the overhaul had begun and reported a “determination to achieve real change”. However, he wrote: “All that is to be commended, but it is clear that there is a long way to go.” Boohoo’s sales figures were “enviable” in the face of disruption caused by Covid, said Emily Salter, a GlobalData analyst, who said the involvement of outside experts had bolstered the credibility of the firm’s supply chain revamp. She said: “Even though some of the group’s actions are still controversial, such as PrettyLittleThing selling clothing items for less than £1 on Black Friday, these changes will help set a standard of greater transparency among fast-fashion brands, boosting investor and consumer confidence.”"
2021-01-14T15:59:47Z,business,Business,"We'll be back, vows Primark after predicting £1bn sales hit","Primark has said lockdown store closures will mean missing out on more than £1bn in sales, but said it was confident of a resurgence after the Covid crisis ends, promising: “We are going to be back.” The fast fashion retailer does not sell online, and three-quarters of its store space is closed, including all of its 190 UK shops, plus a further 115 across European markets such as Germany, Ireland and Spain. John Bason, the finance director at Primark’s owner, Associated British Foods (ABF), said: “We are an emblem of the non-essential retail on the high street that is closed. I hate losing the sales we are going to lose but … we are going to be back. People will want to go on holiday, meet one another and shop at Primark again.” Shop closures and other restrictions in its main UK and European markets resulted in a 30% fall in sales to £2bn during the 16 weeks to 2 January 2021. Sales for the Christmas period in 2019 totalled £2.9bn. The retailer lost sales worth £540m during November and December, prompting it to increase its forecast of a £650m loss, made a fortnight ago, to more than £1bn in the six months to the end of February. Primark has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic because its strategy focuses on bricks-and-mortar stores. Before the pandemic, the strategy helped it become one of the UK’s largest clothing retailers, focusing on low prices rather than expensive investments in online shopping. “Our price point is the reason that we can’t and other people cannot make money online,” said Bason. “That makes us different. When we reopened back in June I met people who said ‘thank God you’re open again, I’ve been waiting for you’. Why are they waiting? Because they can’t get what we offer elsewhere. We’re giving people want they want.” The figures mean sales during the traditionally lucrative Christmas period have dropped for two years in a row. A year ago the retailer said it had switched its focus to growing overseas rather than in the highly competitive UK market. ABF said a 14% like-for-like decline in Primark sales while stores remained open was “strong”, given a “significant decline” in commuting and tourism footfall in city-centre shops. Sales at out-of-town retail park locations were higher than the year before, but shopping centres and regional high streets suffered.
Primark will put unsold clothes for autumn and winter worth £200m in warehouses to try to sell later this year, but still expects to roughly break even because of cost cuts. However, ABF said it would honour all orders with suppliers, after fast fashion retailers were criticised for order cancellations that would effectively make workers in poorer countries bear much of the cost of reduced sales. Primark’s difficulties were balanced by a stronger performance in ABF’s food and agricultural divisions, all of which grew faster than expected. Group revenue fell 13% compared with the same period last year, to £4.8bn. ABF’s agriculture division, which makes animal feed, enjoyed the fastest growth, with sales up by 10% year on year."
2021-01-14T14:11:32Z,business,Business,Christmas on the UK high street: where did shoppers spend their money?,"The crucial pre-Christmas trading period for retailers was disrupted in 2020 by stop-start coronavirus restrictions, which forced shops selling non-essential items to close their doors for certain periods of time, following months of shutdown earlier in the year. As the nation stayed at home, people shopped online. Leisurewear was popular but overall consumers bought fewer items of clothing, knocking sales at fashion retailers. Meanwhile, the big supermarkets benefited from their essential retailer status, as consumers spent more money on groceries while many restaurants, cafes and pubs were forced to close. Sainsbury’s – Winner The UK’s second-largest supermarket reported a 9% rise in like-for-like sales during the Christmas period, from 1 November to the start of January, as shoppers filled their baskets with luxury items including champagne and steak. Sainsbury’s online sales also boomed over the festive period, increasing by 128% to account for almost a fifth (18%) of total sales, allowing the retailer to raise its profit expectations for 2020 by £60m. However, doing business in a pandemic also comes at a cost and, as a result, Sainsbury’s forecasts that its 2020 profits will be 44% lower than the period year. The chain has also pledged to pay back the £410m business rates relief which it was given by the government last spring. Tesco – Winner The UK’s biggest supermarket said booming online and sales and customers opting for luxury festive fare helped it to a record Christmas. Tesco reported sales at stores open for at least a year were 8.1% higher during the key six-week Christmas trading period to 9 January. The chain said it had experienced unprecedented demand for online groceries. The company delivered more than 7m orders containing 400m-plus items over the Christmas season. Morrisons – Winner Luxury festive treats also helped drive Morrisons sales 8.5% higher during the festive period, as shoppers splashed out on champagne and salmon to enjoy at home. Morrisons said online sales had tripled, and it also benefited from its deal with Amazon to supply wholesale products to convenience stores. The supermarket was the only one of the four largest chains in the UK to gain market share over the Christmas period, according to analysis from research group Kantar, thanks to price cuts and an increase in home deliveries. However, the retailer expects its profits to be in line with expectations, less than half the £420m to £440m it had once anticipated, after it agreed to pay back £230m received from the government’s business rates relief. B&M – Winner The fast-growing discount retailer enjoyed strong sales in the run-up to Christmas, topping off a knockout year. B&M said sales in its UK stores soared by 21% in the three months up to Boxing Day, despite not selling anything online. The chain, which supplies everything from tinned goods and pet food to wallpaper and garden sheds, has benefited from its essential retailer status. In addition, many of its stores are located on retail parks, which wary shoppers have tended to favour instead of high streets. B&M’s owners, the billionaire Arora brothers, awarded themselves a £30m payout following soaring Christmas sales, pushing their total dividends received over the last 12 months to almost £100m. As a result of the lockdown sales boom, B&M intends to open up to 45 new stores by March, a third more than it had previously planned. JD Sports – Winner JD Sports, Britain’s biggest sportswear group, has been able to shrug off many of the problems faced by retailers during the pandemic, and hiked its profit forecasts following robust trading. The retail chain reported that its total revenues for the past 22 weeks of 2020 were 5% higher than the previous year, leading it to forecast profits for the last year of at least £400m, well above analysts’ expectations of £295m. JD said that its customers had “readily switched between physical and digital channels” but warned that Covid restrictions were likely to keep its UK stores closed until Easter. The casual wear group, which also owns brands Size?, Blacks Leisure, Millets and Go Outdoors, said earlier in the pandemic that its athleisure products had proved popular with customers stuck at home.
The sportswear chain had been in rescue talks to buy beleaguered department store chain Debenhams, but pulled out when Topshop-owner Arcadia went into administration at the end of November. Lidl – Winner The German discounter hailed 2020 as a record Christmas in the UK, with sales up 17.9% in the four weeks to 27 December, as it grew its market share against the nation’s four biggest supermarkets and rival Aldi. Lidl said customers bought more items when they visited stores, and also spent more as they switched to luxury products from the retailer’s higher-end ranges, including panettone and pink prosecco. Just Eat Takeaway – Winner The closure of restaurants, cafes and pubs to diners prompted consumers across Europe to order 57% more takeaways from Just Eat Takeaway.com in the final three months of 2020. This was a further acceleration in sales from the 46% jump reported by Euorpe’s biggest online food delivery group in the third quarter, as a rebound in coronavirus cases across the region prompted the reintroduction of strict stay-at-home rules. Delivery orders surged by 400% in the UK in the final quarter of the year, compared with a year earlier, as locked-down consumers treated themselves to takeaway meals from their favourite restaurants Asos – Winner The online fashion retailer has raised its full-year profit forecast after a surge in sales of makeup and leisurewear, including jogging bottoms, over the Christmas season. Sales at Asos in the UK increased by 36% in the last four months of 2020, as consumers turned to online retailers when coronavirus restrictions forced their bricks-and-mortar competitors to close their doors. Overall, the company’s retail sales rose by 23% worldwide. Anticipating the closure of non-essential stores to remain in place until at least mid-February, Asos is expecting its half-year profits to be at least £40m higher than previously forecasted. This would mean its profits at the top end of City forecasts, which range from £115m to £170m. Marks & Spencer – Loser Christmas trading was a mixed picture at high street stalwart Marks & Spencer, as store closures knocked its sales of clothing and homeware, while its food halls fared better during the key period. Sales of clothing and homeware dropped by a quarter during the 13 weeks to 26 December, as consumers turned to pyjamas rather than party outfits, with a near halving of in-store sales only partly balanced out by a rise in online sales. The retailer’s food halls traded more positively, with a 2.6% rise in sales at stores open for at least one year, although it suffered from the closure of its large network of in-store cafes. M&S warned that the trading outlook “remains very challenging” because the latest lockdown and store closures could last until Easter. Greggs – Loser Covid heralded a reversal in fortunes for Greggs bakery chain, famous for its steak bakes and vegan sausage rolls, which predicted it will slump to its first-ever annual loss as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The Newcastle-based chain’s sales dropped by more than £300m year on year in 2020, leading it to forecast a £15m annual loss, its first since listing on the stock market in 1984, after Covid restrictions closed its stores and consumers made lunch at home rather than buying a sandwich while out and about. Greggs, which has more than 2,000 outlets in the UK, does not expect profits to recover to pre-Covid levels until 2022. However, the retailer’s expansion plans remain on track and it plans to open a further 100 stores this year.
Primark – Loser The fast fashion retailer expects to miss out on more than £1bn in sales during the first six months of its financial year ending February, as fresh coronavirus restrictions have closed its stores in the UK and Europe. Primark, which does not sell online, said reported a 30% decrease in sales to £2bn during the 16 weeks to 2 January, compared with sales of £2.9bn during the 2019 festive period. Its owner, Associated British Foods (ABF), said sales were “strong” ahead of Christmas when stores were allowed to remain open, but that it had lost sales worth £540m during November and December."
2021-01-14T12:44:57Z,business,Business,Tesco hails record Christmas fuelled by online grocery surge,"Tesco has hailed a “record” Christmas on the back of booming online sales and customers treating themselves to its luxury Christmas food ranges. The UK’s biggest supermarket said sales at stores open one year were up 8.1% over the key six-week Christmas trading period. That was a step up from growth of 6.7% over the three months to 28 November.
Ken Murphy, the Tesco chief executive, described the performance over the six weeks to 9 January as “market-leading”, adding: “We delivered a record Christmas across all of our formats and channels.” The “unprecedented demand for online groceries” meant the company delivered more than 7m orders containing 400m-plus items over Christmas. Murphy also revealed there were some gaps on in its shelves in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as the supermarket chain grappled with new post-Brexit border controls. The problem was focused on products, such as ready meals and processed meats, which have a short shelf life, as well as citrus fruits. Tesco has hired a veterinary agency to certify products before they cross the border. “We are working with government on both sides of the Irish Sea to smooth the flow of products and I would say that our availability in both markets remains strong,” Murphy said. “The disruption is limited to certain categories, with a particular emphasis on some short shelf-life products where every hour, let alone every day counts.” The company was also experiencing “teething problems” at the main Channel crossing, where about a tenth of the food consumed in the UK is transported. “Inevitably there are the bedding issues that you would expect with any new process that’s been set up as a relatively short notice,” said Murphy. “We’re working our way through and we would hope over the coming weeks and months that we will end up with a much smoother flow of product. “I want to reassure the public that we are coping with this and availability in Northern Ireland, the Republic and mainland UK remains very strong. We see this as a challenge that needs to be overcome and resolved … but we don’t see it as a crisis.” Last week Marks & Spencer complained about new “rules of origin” regulations, which dictate whether tariffs must be paid based on where a product’s ingredients come from and where it has been manufactured. However, Tesco said the issue was minimal for its business.
With more shoppers turning to the web to buy groceries, the retailer said online sales had increased by more than 80% over the 19 weeks. That equates to nearly £1bn in extra sales. The retailer also highlighted that sales in its largest stores also grew strongly as customers favoured larger, less frequent shopping trips. Sales of its Finest range were up 14% over Christmas while demand for plant-based products also increased strongly, with sales of its Plant Chef range up more than 90%. General merchandise sales were also up 4% driven by a strong performance in toys, home and electrical items. Tesco, which is the UK’s largest private sector employer, said about 10%, or 30,000, of its staff were off or shielding as a result of coronavirus, three-fifths the number in the initial months of the pandemic. The retailer is introducing rapid testing in its distribution centres and Murphy urged the government to prioritise vaccinating food industry workers after the vulnerable groups had been done. The company said extra costs linked to the pandemic would be £810m in the current financial year, up almost £100m from a previous estimate. Its annual profits forecast remained unchanged despite the strong Christmas performance. Sales at its wholesale arm Booker, which Tesco bought for £3.7bn in 2017, have been dented by the closure of hospitality businesses. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said Tesco had done well but had not “shot the lights out”. The sales growth was, he said, “a little behind our expectations. Whereas Sainsbury’s has been boosted by Argos, Tesco has witnessed greater headwinds than we anticipated from Booker in the UK, where lockdowns have been weighing heavily upon the catering side of the business.” Tesco’s shares closed at 241.4p, remaining flat compared to the previous day’s traiding."
2021-01-14T12:37:34Z,business,Business,"Norwegian axes long-haul flights and cuts 1,100 Gatwick jobs","Norwegian has announced it will no longer fly long-haul routes, even after the pandemic, bringing an end to its low-cost, long-haul vision and spelling the loss of about 1,100 jobs based at Gatwick airport. The airline said it would retrench to a short-haul European network and domestic Norwegian routes for good, as it outlined its business plan for survival. About 2,150 jobs in the UK, Spain, France and the US will go, and one union warned that the airline industry was in an employment “death spiral”. The airline’s 1,100 UK flight crew and pilots had been furloughed since the start of the Covid-19 crisis. About 400 other UK crew who worked on short-haul routes were made redundant last year. The airline is going through bankruptcy protection proceedings in Ireland that will allow it to restructure and continue operations by demonstrating a viable business plan to judges there. Norwegian will no longer retain any of its fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners that it used to fly long-haul, and will reduce its overall fleet to 50 narrow-body planes. It was once the third-biggest airline at Gatwick and pioneered low-cost transatlantic flights, but its ambitious expansion put it in financial peril even before Covid-19 hit. The airline’s plan focuses on saving Norwegian jobs and it is understood to be in renewed dialogue with Norway’s government about potential state support, two months after ministers said they could not invest more taxpayers’ money in propping up the airline. Jacob Schram, the airline’s chief executive, said: “Our short-haul network has always been the backbone of Norwegian and will form the basis of a future resilient business model. By focusing our operation on a short-haul network, we aim to attract existing and new investors, serve our customers and support the wider infrastructure and travel industry in Norway and across the Nordics and Europe.” The pilots’ union Balpa said Norwegian’s announcement was further devastating news for UK airline staff, with about 300 pilots among the 1,100 Gatwick job losses.
Brian Strutton, Balpa’s general secretary, said: “The airline has failed for several reasons but there can be no blame apportioned to the pilot, crew or other staff groups.” He said it was further evidence of the “jobs death spiral”, adding that “aviation remains in serious crisis”. The Unite union, which represents crew, said airline workers had not been consulted about the job losses and were owed outstanding wages and redundancy pay, and should be the first priority during the insolvency process of Norwegian’s UK arm. Under Norwegian’s complex company structure, only its subsidiaries employing the crew have gone into liquidation, allowing its Gatwick-based airline, Norwegian UK, to survive on paper and one day potentially return to the air. However, it is extremely unlikely to spread its wings quite so far again. Schram said: “Our focus is to rebuild a strong, profitable Norwegian so that we can safeguard as many jobs as possible. We do not expect customer demand in the long-haul sector to recover in the near future.”"
2021-01-14T12:00:37Z,business,Business,Own a small business? It's time to start thinking abut 2022 | Gene Marks,"No kidding, 2021 will clearly be a strange year for small businesses and our employees. And while it might seem strange to say it, one thing you need to do is start thinking about 2022.
Many companies are either starting this year with their employees working from home or not working at all because of shutdowns. Other businesses that are having their employees come in to work are doing so cautiously. I was at a client last week and the atmosphere was somber: everyone wearing masks, staying away from each other, quietly working at their desks, hand sanitizers close by. Workplaces right now are not fun places to be. That’ll change this year. Eventually. Many economists are predicting a strong recovery in the second half of 2021, which means that hiring will significantly pick up. As that happens, small businesses will be back to competing with larger companies for talent. All of this is coming. In anticipation of that happening, many of us are already re-visiting our benefit strategies. We need to be competitive. We need to bring on great people. We need to keep our best people. So what will be the best benefits to offer? According to studies like this one from the Hartford, they will include, of course, health and retirement plans, paid time off, and other new benefits rising such as help with student loans, mental health coverage and even pet insurance. But the smartest business owners won’t be thinking about their 2021 benefits. They’ll be thinking of the benefits they’ll be providing to their employees in 2022. And beyond that. They’ll be thinking about the best way to keep their employees productive, happy and motivated for the long term. They’ll want to create the type of culture that will move their companies forward and leverage the very best of their people. My prediction is that one employee benefit will rise to the very top of the list in 2022, and we can thank the pandemic for it. That essential benefit will be working from home. Working from home will no longer be an alternative or a response to Covid. It will be a required benefit of any growing company. It is now no less important than health insurance, retirement plans and paid time off. The smartest small business owners will have learned from the pandemic that the cloud is reliable, the technology works and that their people can be trusted to do their jobs independently and without us breathing down their necks. Our employees, meanwhile, have embraced the ability to work out of their houses, spend more time with their families and enjoy more flexibility with their days. So to compete with larger employers, small businesses owners will need to embrace working from home. Given what we experienced in 2020 and half of 2021 employees will expect this option in 2022. It will no longer be about health and safety. It will be about quality of life. That’s not to say that our employees will want to work from home all the time. They won’t. Many have found that working from home 100% of the time can be stifling. People like to be with people. People need to be with people.
So if you’re an employer like me, you won’t be shutting down your offices. Instead, our work-from-home policies will require maybe two, three or even four days in-person where we can see an employee’s smiling face and radiant personality. That’s because collaboration, conversation and socialization is a critical part of every company’s culture. So there will be a balance. Both big brands and small businesses will mix their in-office requirements with work from home options and the best ones will change their performance reviews to focus on results achieved, regardless of when, where and how they were achieved. Believe it or not, I still have a few clients that are resisting this. It amazes me. They’re going back to the old ways. They actually still feel that their people need to be there 100% of the time to their jobs. Of course, that will always apply to some workers – those on the production floor or warehouse. But for so many others these small business owners are dinosaurs. They’re living in the past. They don’t realize that working from home isn’t just a response to Covid.

2021-01-14T10:28:03Z,business,Business,"Pimlico Plumbers to introduce 'no jab, no job' work contracts","Pimlico Plumbers will introduce a “no jab, no job” policy requiring all of its workers to be vaccinated against Covid-19. Charlie Mullins, Pimlico’s founder and former chief executive, now chairman, said the company’s lawyers were drafting new employment contracts for its 400-strong workforce to include the vaccine requirement, although employment lawyers questioned whether it would be legally enforceable. Governments around the world have started major programmes after regulators approved a series of vaccinations. The UK had given more than 2.6 million people the first dose of a vaccine by Tuesday. Extensive medical trials have found that the vaccines approved by UK regulators are safe. However, there are concerns that the increase in hesitancy and so-called anti-vaxxers will lead to lower vaccination rates, risking further coronavirus outbreaks and potentially endangering the lives of others.
“No vaccine, no job,” Mullins said in an interview with City A.M. “When we go off to Africa and Caribbean countries, we have to have a jab for malaria – we don’t think about it, we just do it. So why would we accept something within our country that’s going to kill us when we can have a vaccine to stop it?” Some tropical countries require travellers to have inoculations against diseases such as yellow fever. There is no malaria vaccine, but antimalarial treatments – typically delivered in pill form – are also commonplace.
However, employment lawyers said attempts by companies to force employees to be vaccinated could lead to claims of discrimination or constructive dismissal, potentially opening employers up to expensive compensation claims. Not even the UK government has the power to force citizens to be vaccinated. Nick Wilcox, a partner at BDBF, a London-based law firm, said employers would have to balance their duty of care for employees during the pandemic against their duty not to undermine employees’ trust or confidence in employers. He said mandatory vaccinations “could be an issue”, particularly if an employee has a religious or philosophical belief that they should not receive a vaccine. Wilcox advised that employers should seek to consult employees about vaccinations rather than trying to impose them. Other businesses have backed the vaccines. Unilever’s chief executive, Alan Jope, said on Wednesday that the company would strongly encourage all of its workers to have the vaccine, but said the FTSE 100 firm would stop short of making it mandatory. In Australia, the Council of Small Business Organisations, a lobby group, said last summer it would back making vaccinations mandatory. “If one of my staff members says: ‘No, I’m against it’, then I’m going to have to say: ‘I’m sorry you are a threat to my business’,” its chief executive, Peter Strong, told Australia’s 7News. “If you don’t sack them, you don’t have a business, especially if you’re in a high-contact area where you’ve got a lot of customers.”"
2021-01-14T00:01:22Z,business,Business,Study warns of huge jobs losses in retail in England after pandemic,"England’s high streets could lose up to 400,000 retail jobs as a result of more people working from home and shopping online after the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report, with affluent towns in the south among the most vulnerable. Out of the 109 towns and cities studied by the accountancy firm KPMG, Bracknell in the London commuter belt was judged to be most at risk of having the greatest declines in retail employment as a share of local economic activity. An increase in remote working and online shopping is expected to be one of the lasting legacies of the pandemic. However, the report said some places would record a bigger decline in commuter footfall than others, and that this would accelerate the hollowing-out of high street shopping in these locations. According to the research, up to 27.4% of jobs in Bracknell – home to big technology firms including Fujitsu and Dell, and a popular base for London office workers – were expected to be still done from home, even after physical-distancing measures have been relaxed. KPMG said this would deliver a heavy blow to retailers in the Berkshire town because it would reduce commuter footfall, leading to the loss of as many as 1,505 jobs, or about 38% of the local retail sector. The percentages were similar in towns including Basingstoke, Hemel Hempstead, Warrington and Guildford, which KPMG ranked among the most vulnerable locations in England for high street job losses. In a warning to the government, KPMG said the shifting trends caused by the pandemic would have far-reaching consequences for Boris Johnson’s levelling-up agenda, which has so far focused on historically weaker local economies in the Midlands and northern England. Finding that some of the most vulnerable places in the Covid recession were in the traditionally affluent south-east, the company said the balance was shifting so that these areas would need to do more to refocus their local economies in future. However, more people typically work from home in these locations because there are more jobs in higher-paying sectors of the economy in which remote work is easier, such as in IT and finance. According to KPMG, towns such as Burnley, Bradford and Huddersfield rank within the least affected by the crisis, in part because fewer jobs in these places can be done remotely. While this could protect retail employment, many towns central to the levelling-up agenda were struggling before the pandemic and would, therefore, still need additional support coming out of the crisis. Some commentators have also suggested that the rise of home working could help smaller towns and cities to emerge stronger from the pandemic, as fewer people may need to travel to big cities such as London, Birmingham and Manchester. So far during the pandemic, central London has experienced the biggest hit to jobs owing to the dramatic decline in commuter footfall. The population of the capital is expected to fall for the first time since 1988 this year as a consequence, as more people move out to the suburbs. However, KPMG said the retail sector in big cities such as London would remain resilient, because its cultural amenities would continue to attract visitors after the relaxation of Covid restrictions, helping to cushion the blow from fewer commuters. The most vulnerable locations, it said, had the highest number of home workers and fewest cultural assets – such as sports centres, museums and arts venues, as well as pubs, cafes and restaurants.
According to the report, London, Liverpool, Burnley and Birmingham were the most resilient to the economic impact of further home working and online shopping. Yael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG in the UK, said: “As people travel less for work or to shop, town and city centres will need alternative offerings to fill vacant space and to attract people to the area as we hopefully leave the pandemic behind sometime this year. “High streets will need to be reimagined as cultural and recreational hubs that will act as magnets for businesses and jobs able to transform less prosperous areas.” The 10 most vulnerable places post-Covid 1 Bracknell 2 Hemel Hempstead 3 Basingstoke 4 Warrington 5 Guildford 6 Swindon 7 Watford 8 Slough 9 Stockport 10 Basildon"
2021-01-13T19:55:48Z,business,Business,Legal bid launched to ban ex-Carillion directors from top boardroom roles,"The UK government has launched a legal bid to ban eight former Carillion directors from holding senior boardroom positions, almost three years on from the collapse of the outsourcing business. The Insolvency Service, which handles corporate collapses, said it was seeking to disqualify the directors “in the public interest”, in a move that could result in them being banned from acting as UK company directors or in senior management for between two and 15 years each. The legal action, launched by the new business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, comes within days of the three-year anniversary of the company’s collapse, when more than 3,000 jobs were lost and 450 public sector projects including hospitals, schools and prisons were plunged into crisis. The court proceedings name eight individuals. The former chairman Philip Green – who was once an adviser to David Cameron on corporate responsibility – is among those listed as a defendant, alongside the former chief executives Richard Howson – who left after six years in charge in 2017, months before the company’s collapse – and Keith Cochrane, a company director since 2015 who took over in its final months before failure in January 2018. Two former finance directors and three boardroom non-executives are also named. The action follows the submission of a report about each director’s conduct by the official receiver – the part of the Insolvency Service charged with handling Carillion’s liquidation.
Kwarteng, who took over from Alok Sharma as business secretary this week, is understood to have determined it was right for the government to take action against the individuals for their conduct. Boris Johnson relieved Sharma as business secretary so he could work full-time on preparations for the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow this November. Carillion was one of the biggest outsourcing contractors in the UK, with its work for the government spanning the construction of road and rail infrastructure to running school canteens. Its collapse with debts of £7bn was the largest corporate failure in the UK in a decade, and prompted widespread criticism of its current and former executives and auditors, as well as the government’s handling of public sector contracts with private companies. A spokesman for the Insolvency Service said: “We can confirm that on 12 January 2021 the secretary of state issued company director disqualification proceedings in the public interest against eight directors and former directors of Carillion.”"
2021-01-13T19:44:17Z,business,Business,Asos turnaround shows Covid has been kind to online retailers | Nils Pratley,"It’s amazing now to recall that stock market investors initially thought lockdowns would be bad for online clothing retailers. Shares in Asos roughly halved to £13 during the month of March 2020. They now stand at £53 as business has boomed. Best of all for shareholders, the company has stopped shooting itself in the foot. Asos over-stretched in 2018 and 2019 by trying to build mega-warehouses in Berlin and Atlanta at the same. It botched both projects, issued three profit warnings in rapid succession, and made outsiders wonder if an impressive revenue line would ever yield solid profits. An answer seems closer now. The rough tally this financial year is looking like almost £4bn in sales and about £170m in pre-tax profits. If 4%-ish becomes a reliable profit margin, Asos will have shaken off one big investment worry. The margin triumph is not yet in the bag, it should be added, because trading in the time of Covid yielded a double benefit. Punters did not merely buy more items, they also returned fewer (nobody’s too fussed about the fit of stay-at-home jogging bottoms).
There’s also the slight worry that Asos’s 20-something audience is more exposed to a drop in disposable income, where the worst effects may still lie ahead. In the round, though, Covid conditions have clearly been kind to Asos. The pace of sales growth accelerated to 24% in the last four months of 2020, including a remarkable 36% in the UK. Not all the extra business will stick when shops reopen, but a lot should. Asos is now back at a £5bn valuation. Next, with half its business online already, has passed £10bn – its shares have doubled since their own wobble in March. The stock market’s revised view, in other words, is that prospects for online clothing retailers have changed permanently and fundamentally. Yes, that conclusion now seems blindingly obvious. In retrospect, the sell-off last March was an extraordinary event. NAO needs listening to Governments should listen more closely to the National Audit Office, argued the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, in her Mais lecture on Wednesday evening. That thought is hardly revolutionary, but it has two obvious virtues. First, it is a good idea. Second, Labour needs to talk the language of competence in public spending. The tragedy of the NAO, the independent public spending watchdog, is that it produces excellent – and often damning – reports that ministers are somehow able to brush aside. A humdinger from the NAO last November set out, in cold terms, the scale of waste and cronyism in the government’s procurement programme during the pandemic. About £10.5bn out of £18bn of public contracts were awarded without competitive tender and companies were 10 times more likely to succeed in their pitches if they had connections to the Tory party. Even if one allows for the need to act at speed during a health emergency, the statistics are scandalous.
Dodds’s idea is that the head of the NAO should make a single annual assessment of the effectiveness of public spending and the government should be obliged to respond. That would not, of course guarantee an end to waste and cronyism. But, yes, it’s a more accountable approach than allowing NAO reports to generate a day’s headlines and then gather dust. The political point is that Labour desperately needs to make a display of being on top of financial details. Even when the pandemic has passed, the UK’s budget deficits will still be enormous for years to come. So, yes, hammering away at “value for money” in public spending is essential given the daily reminders (the latest being provision of free school meals) of the government’s loose grip of details. Dodds is an unflashy politician and, until Labour breaks more definitely with some of the policy pledges of the Jeremy Corbyn era, her speech may be lost in the political noise. But it aimed broadly in the right direction, which is a start. Efficient public spending matters, never more so than now. Covid brings HR complexities How should companies treat staff who refuse to get vaccinated? Make them take regular Covid tests, says Alan Jope, Unilever’s chief executive. Yes, that’s a commonsense answer. But can one also sack employees who refuse to get tested, or make them work at home? Covid complexities have only just started for human relations departments."
2021-01-13T19:01:45Z,business,Business,"Unilever workers will never return to desks full-time, says boss","The boss of Unilever, one of the UK’s biggest companies, has said his office workers will never return to their desks five days a week, in the latest indication that coronavirus will transform modern working life. Alan Jope, the chief executive of the consumer goods group, said the company would also encourage all of its employees to receive vaccinations against Covid-19, but would stop short of making jabs mandatory. Employees who opt not to be vaccinated, however, will face mandatory testing. Jope said the company would look at different working patterns after it saw during the pandemic that it could adapt and make big changes far more quickly than previously thought.
Unilever, the third most valuable company on the London Stock Exchange, is the maker of brands including Dove soap, Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and Marmite. It also owns Hellman’s, Knorr, Lipton and Persil. The pandemic has forced office staff to work from home in most of Unilever’s main markets, including the US and UK. Factory workers in most economies have been exempt from stay-at-home orders. Speaking on Wednesday at a Reuters conference, Jope said he did not expect office workers across western Europe and north America to return to work until at least April, and added that Unilever would use a “hybrid mode” of working between homes and offices after that. Permanent changes are expected for many of its 150,000 global employees, 7,000 of whom are in the UK. “We anticipate never going back to five days a week in the office,” Jope said. “That seems very old-fashioned now.” He also said the pandemic had made it clear that the company did not need to be as hierarchical. However, he added that Unilever was still keen to return to offices after seeing a “slow erosion of social capital” as working from home prevents colleagues from meeting in person. Many business leaders have voiced concerns about lack of innovation and the impact on training younger staff when workers do not congregate. Several large companies have said they intend to keep some of the new ways of working forced upon them by the pandemic. Twitter last year said it would allow employees to work from home “forever”, while the owners of empty city-centre offices are nervously hoping that economists are incorrect in predicting a sustained increase in homeworking.
Morgan Stanley last summer predicted 30% of US workers would work from home after the pandemic, double pre-Covid estimates. Unilever is already experimenting with working practices. In New Zealand, its staff are trialling a four-day week, making it one of the biggest companies to consider reducing the hours its employees work, after a number of smaller firms found it helped productivity and employees’ wellbeing. The 81 New Zealand staff will continue with the four-day week until December, when Unilever will assess its performance and consider whether to extend it around the world. As well as bringing changes to working life, the pandemic has altered spending patterns, hitting sales of products such as ice creams but helping sales of cleaning products and food for home cooking. Jope highlighted the “rise of e-everything” during the pandemic, referring to increased online shopping from consumers stuck at home, as well as increased concern from consumers on environmental and social sustainability. “People are e-browsing, e-buying, e-paying, e-media-consuming and we expect that will continue,” he said. “We can rely on people’s use of technology to stick around.” The pandemic will continue to disrupt European and American economies during the first half of 2021, depressing spending, Jope said. However, he said east Asian economies such as Singapore and China – which have effectively suppressed viral outbreaks – were almost back to normal . On vaccinations, Jope criticised “vaccine hesitancy” and said Unilever would try to ensure access to vaccines for all of its workers. But, he added: “I don’t want any of my employees to be jumping the queue on frontline medical workers or vulnerable people.”"
2021-01-13T17:29:23Z,business,Business,Covid lockdown in UK prompts sales surge at Lidl and Just Eat,"Lockdown living has driven a surge in demand at Lidl and the food courier Just Eat, with both companies posting strong sales for the final weeks of 2020. With restaurants and cafes closed to diners, the boom in home eating led Just Eat Takeaway.com to report a 57% spike in orders across Europe during the final three months of last year, compared with a year earlier. The leap in trade reported by the continent’s biggest food delivery service was a further acceleration in growth from the 46% jump in the third quarter. In the UK, delivery orders surged by almost 400% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the same period of 2019, as many consumers were once again asked by the government to stay indoors. Just Eat Takeaway, based in the Netherlands and one of the world’s largest online food delivery firms, said it had put “tremendous effort” into improving its British business, including a doubling of its UK sales force. “In 2021, we will continue to invest in price leadership, improving our service levels and expanding our offering to restaurants and consumers,” said Jitse Groen, the chief executive. Lidl also reported a record Christmas, as customers celebrated with panettone and pink prosecco. Sales at the chain rose by 17.9% in the four weeks to 27 December, compared with the same period a year earlier. The increase was larger than those at the UK’s four biggest supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – and Aldi.
British supermarkets notched up their biggest month on record in December, with consumers spending £11.7bn on take-home groceries, according to analysts at the research group Kantar, as coronavirus restrictions led to the closure of many restaurants, pubs and cafes during the key trading period. Lidl said shoppers bought more goods – with basket size increasing by almost 25% year on year – and British households switched £34.7m of spend to Lidl from other supermarkets. Customers’ taste for premium food and drink over the Christmas period boosted their spend, and sales of Lidl’s Deluxe range climbed by 22%. Lidl shoppers bought more than 1m bottles of pink prosecco during the festive period, as well as 2.7m panettones. An average of 17,000 Deluxe mince pies an hour were sold during December.
Christian Härtnagel, chief executive of Lidl GB, said its record sales and basket size growth demonstrated the strength of the chain’s appeal. And the store’s first branded Christmas jumper, featuring the logo as part of a festive design, appears to have topped the charts, with one sold every minute in the month to 27 December. “Despite this Christmas being a difficult time for many across the country, we are pleased to have been able to help our customers enjoy themselves by offering high-quality food at the lowest prices on the market,” he said."

The head of the European Central Bank has called for bitcoin to face global regulation. Christine Lagarde said the cryptocurrency was a highly speculative asset used for money-laundering and other â€˜funny businessâ€™. The criticism had little impact on bitcoin itself, though, which is broadly flat today at $34,600. Oil has hit its highest level in close to a year, before dropping back.

2021-01-13T16:30:14Z,business,Business,Australia has huge growth in job vacancies – but that doesn't mean it's easy to find one | Greg Jericho,"The latest job vacancy figures released yesterday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that while things are improving, unemployment will remain high until the impact and restrictions of the pandemic are gone.
It continues to be tough to make sense of economic data at the moment. Wild shifts are still happening, with record growth replacing record falls. As I noted earlier this week, however, we can say that the employment situation is better than it was. The Department of Employment’s leading indicator, which tracks a number of different economic surveys to gauge how things are going, has now turned positive for the first time since February 2020. Admittedly, the index only recorded a score of 0.05, but after what we experienced last year, we’ll take whatever we can get:
And it accords with what we are seeing with job vacancies. In the May quarter last year, job vacancies fell a record 43%; this was followed by a record rise of 60% in the August quarter. The latest figures released yesterday show that in the November quarter vacancies rose another stunning 23%:
That is, of course, good news, and it is somewhat amazing that vacancies in November were 12% higher in 2020 than they were in 2019. And the increase in jobs available is across the spectrum of the economy. All industries recorded more vacancies in the November quarter than in August. Astonishingly, seven industries: manufacturing, utilities, accommodation and food services, financial services, health and social care, and arts and recreation recorded the highest number of vacancies in a quarter since such records began in 2009. Vacancies in the arts and recreation sector grew by 233% in November:
And yet this does not mean a jobs boom. It’s part of the problem of economic data at the moment. Usually such a surge in job vacancies is a sign of a very healthy economy; whereas now it is more a sign of an economy moving out of lockdown. It is good to be sure, but boasting about record growth in vacancies does not necessarily mean we are about to have a record level of employment – rather that last year we had a record number of layoffs. As it is, the fight for jobs remains mostly tougher than it was prior to the pandemic – if at least not at the absurd levels reached in May last year. Across the nation, in November there were 3.7 unemployed people for every job vacancy. The hardest states to find work were Victoria, with 4.2 unemployed per vacancy, Tasmania with 4 and Queensland with 3.9. The best were Western Australia and New South Wales with 2.4 and 3.2 unemployed per vacancy respectively:
It is worth noting that only in NSW and Victoria was the fight to get work tougher in November than it was in February. This is because the number of vacancies more than compensated the increased unemployment. But this does not really mean it is easy to get work. What the relationship between the job vacancies and unemployment shows is that the number of vacancies is really an aberration and also that the labour market is massively constrained at the moment. Economists like to compare the unemployment rate with the “job vacancy rate” (the number of vacancies as a percentage of the labour force). Generally as the rate of one rise the other falls – a high job vacancy rate usually means a low unemployment rate. In both February and May last year the relationship held, but then in August and November it completely broke:
Normally with the vacancy rate of 1.84% that occurred in November you would expect unemployment to be around 4% – not 6.8%. What this highlights is the how the struggle with the labour market is that workers are prevented from getting jobs. It’s all very well for there to be a job available, but it is not much good if it is in a place you are not able to travel to. Or if the available jobs are in an industry you can’t to work in (either because it does not suit or you are not qualified). From May to November accommodation and food services jobs accounted for 13% of the increase in vacancies. Normally they account for just 6.5%. That’s great if you want such a job, but not so much if you don’t – especially given such work is generally lower paid and not full-time.
On the other hand jobs in administration and supply accounted for just 7% of the increase – normally they account for 15%. And so we have a labour market offering much more hospitality jobs than normal and much fewer admin jobs. It all makes for a bumpy road out of the pandemic and for many workers the smooth path looks to be well off in the future."
2021-01-13T16:20:48Z,business,Business,Next shares near all-time high as sales hold up during pandemic,"Shares in the UK clothing retailer Next are close to an all-time high, thanks to a strategy that has seen the company sail through Covid-19 headwinds. With the start of the first lockdown last March, Next feared shuttering its high street stores would have a disastrous impact on finances. But sales have held up better than anticipated, bolstered by demand for home furnishings, loungewear and children’s clothing. The stock has been given an extra boost by a retreat from speculators who have been betting against it, with one analyst saying short sellers have “thrown in the towel”. The Next share price rose as high as £79.34 on Wednesday, close to the record of £80.15 reached in December and August 2015. The shares have more than doubled since they fell to a low of £36.62 in March, and have gained nearly 15% over the past year. Next has emerged as one of the winners from a tough Christmas period thanks to strong online sales. In the nine weeks to 26 December, sales were 1.1% lower than a year earlier, a much better performance than the 8% decline the company had forecasted in the autumn. While takings at its physical stores decreased 43%, online sales were up 36%. Simon Wolfson, its chief executive, has said the £28m of extra profit from better-than-expected sales in November and December will be all but wiped out by the impact of shutdowns during the Boxing Day sales as well as new lockdowns in England and Scotland in the new yearthat have forced non-essential retailers to close again, including Next’s 500-store chain. However, even if stores remain closed through February and March, Next is forecasting profits of £670m for the coming year. The figure would be within 10% of pre-pandemic levels. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at the trading platform Markets.com, said Next could seemingly “do no wrong”, adding: “Wolfson is clearly the best retailer out there.”
Wilson said Next, together with web-only retailers such as Asos, have clearly emerged as “online winners”, noting that short sellers have “thrown in the towel in the last couple of months which has been helping drive the stock higher.” Asos reported strong sales on Wednesday, driven by beauty products and leisure wear. Wilson said investors were drawn to companies that generated lots of cash, like Next, in the hope of big dividend payments. He added: “Crucially, while you could see the growth in online-only retailers ebb this year, if you think of those companies that can keep the foot to the pedal and accelerate growth rates as the reopening occurs this year, then Next is exceptionally well placed to benefit from that too. A foot in both online and bricks-and-mortar camps is looking like a solid foundation for continued growth.”"
2021-01-13T15:18:12Z,business,Business,Demand for makeup and jogging bottoms boosts Asos sales,"A surge in sales of makeup and jogging bottoms over the Christmas period has boosted sales at the online fashion retailer Asos, which is expecting to make bigger full-year profits as a result. As Christmas parties were cancelled because of the Covid-19 pandemic and many office workers now work from home, shoppers splashed out on comfortable leisure wear including tracksuit bottoms, rather than party frocks. Health and beauty products – “makeup, lotions and potions of all sorts” – were also popular, said Nick Beighton, the Asos chief executive, as customers focus more on their wellbeing and improving their looks for video calls. The number of regular shoppers at the online firm rose by more than 1 million to 24.5 million. UK sales rose by 36% over the last four months of 2020, as Asos benefited from a surge in online shopping since the coronavirus outbreak last March, while Covid-19 restrictions forced high street rivals to shut non-essential retail stores. Total retail sales worldwide advanced 23%, including 18% growth in the EU and 13% in the US. Asos also benefited as customers returned fewer items, due to tighter restrictions across the UK, and the November lockdown in England. With England and Scotland entering new lockdowns in the new year, and restrictions likely to last until at least mid-February, Asos expects a Covid boost to pre-tax profits of at least £40m in its first half. As a result, it said pre-tax profits would hit the top end of City forecasts for the year to 31 August 2021, which range from £115m to £170m. In the previous year, profits more than quadrupled to £142.1m. Even so, Beighton highlighted an uncertain outlook. “Looking forward, given the uncertainty associated with the virus and the impact on customers’ lives, our cautious outlook for the second half of the year remains unchanged.” Asos also said that Brexit “country of origin” rules, which cover the shipment of products between the UK and the EU, would result in tariff costs of £15m. It announced earlier this week it would build a £90m distribution centre in Lichfield, Staffordshire that will handle parcels for its online clothing and beauty business and hire 2,000 people over the next three years."
2021-01-13T14:54:48Z,business,Business,Debenhams to shut six stores including Oxford Street flagship,"Debenhams’ flagship Oxford Street store in London and five other branches will not reopen after the current coronavirus lockdown. The department store chain, which is being wound down, said shops in Portsmouth, Staines, Harrogate, Weymouth and Worcester would also shut permanently. As a result, 320 staff – including 140 at Oxford Street – who are currently furloughed will be made redundant. The beleaguered retailer, which traces its roots back 243 years and started trading as a drapery and haberdasher from a shop near its Oxford Street store, entered liquidation at the start of December after the JD Sports chain walked away from rescue talks. Debenhams had hoped to reopen its Oxford Street branch to finish selling off stock, but the retailer said it had been unable to extend its lease, which ends on 17 February. The company said it expected lockdown measures to remain in place until at least March, meaning Oxford Street would not be able to reopen.
Debenhams intends to reopen as many stores as possible after the lockdown to complete the liquidation of its remaining stock. In the meantime, its closing down sale continues online. Geoff Rowley, a joint administrator to Debenhams at FRP Advisory, said: “We continue to engage with interested parties over alternative proposals for the future of Debenhams, but inevitably the latest lockdown has had an effect on our plans for the wind-down of the business. We regret the impact on those colleagues affected by today’s announcement and would like to thank all those who continue to keep the business trading in very difficult circumstances.” The permanent closure of the Oxford Street branch is a further blow for the popular shopping street in central London, after the announcement earlier in January that the building that housed the flagship Topshop store is up for sale after the brand’s owner, Arcadia, collapsed into administration."
2021-01-13T14:44:53Z,business,Business,Honda to close UK plant for four days owing to supply chain problems,"Honda will shut its UK factory for four days next week as global supply chain problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic continue to plague the Japanese carmaker. The closure is thought to be related to the unavailability of semiconductors, the computer chips used to run cars’ onboard management systems. The problem has affected carmakers around the world. Volkswagen has described it as a “global semiconductor bottleneck”. Honda UK told workers that some production activities would be suspended between 18 and 21 January because of Covid-related global supply issues, a spokesperson said. The factory will aim to restart production on 22 January, he added. Volkswagen, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, Ford and Nissan have all been forced to adjust production around the world. VW, the world’s largest carmaker by volume, said it would have to build 100,000 fewer cars because of the semiconductor shortage. Honda’s UK plant, in Swindon, Wiltshire, is to close its doors permanently in the summer, but its final months have not been smooth. The plant, which builds the Civic car, is the firm’s only manufacturing site in Europe, meaning it is heavily reliant on imports from Asia. Global container shortages caused big problems for importers before Christmas, adding to congestion at British ports as companies stockpiled before the UK left the EU’s single market on New Year’s Day. Honda was forced to begin the Christmas shutdown at Swindon a week early. Toyota and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) also closed early because of the supply chain problems at their respective plants in Burnaston, Derbyshire, and Castle Bromwich in the West Midlands. The semiconductor shortage has added yet another complication, pitting carmakers against consumer electronics manufacturers for supplies as sales rise after the pandemic disruption. Carmakers have increasingly added more complex computing for systems ranging from in-car entertainment to the battery management that plays a crucial role in electric vehicles. “Demand has been growing as cars become more and more connected,” said Kristina Church, the head of sustainable solutions at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. She said the pandemic had caused problems for carmakers, shifting their focus away from refining lean “just-in-time” supply chains towards preparing for “just-in-case” supplies of key components.
Other UK factories have not yet been directly affected by the semiconductor shortages, although Toyota, BMW and JLR said they were closely monitoring the situation. BMW has not yet restarted production at its Mini plant in Oxford after an extended Christmas shutdown to install new painting equipment. All of JLR’s plants have reopened and production at Toyota and Vauxhall’s UK plants is also going ahead as planned. The sensitivity of supply chains has been underlined by the recent problems as companies adjust to new trading barriers that came with the Brexit trade deal agreed on Christmas Eve. The deal ensured that carmakers in Britain for now face no tariffs or quotas on most imports or exports from the EU, after some companies warned that tariffs could endanger the future of their UK operations. However, new customs checks have added obstacles, and car industry executives are warily eyeing UK ports as trading volumes pick up after a new year lull."
2021-01-13T10:40:15Z,business,Business,Panettone and pink prosecco push Lidl to record UK Christmas,"Lidl has celebrated a record Christmas in the UK as customers switched to the discount supermarket for festive treats including panettone and pink prosecco. Sales at the chain rose by 17.9% in the four weeks to 27 December, compared with the same period a year earlier. The increase was larger than those at the nation’s four biggest supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – and the fellow discounter Aldi.
Customers’ taste for premium food and drink over the Christmas period boosted their spend, and sales of Lidl’s Deluxe range climbed by 22%. Lidl shoppers bought more than 1m bottles of pink prosecco during the festive period, as well as 2.7m servings of panettone. An average of 17,000 Deluxe mince pies an hour were sold during December. The store’s first branded Christmas jumper, featuring the logo as part of a festive design, was popular, with one sold every minute in the month to 27 December.
British supermarkets notched up their biggest month on record in December, spending £11.7bn on take-home groceries, according to analysts at the research group Kantar, as coronavirus restrictions led to the closure of many restaurants, pubs and cafes during the key trading period. Lidl said shoppers bought more goods – with basket size increasing by almost 25% year on year – and British households switched £34.7m of spend to Lidl from other supermarkets.
Christian Härtnagel, the chief executive for Lidl GB, said its record sales and basket size growth demonstrated the strength of the chain’s appeal. “Despite this Christmas being a difficult time for many across the country, we are pleased to have been able to help our customers enjoy themselves by offering high-quality food at the lowest prices on the market,” he said. In December, Härtnagel joined the ranks of supermarket bosses who said they would return the government’s business rates relief. The privately owned German chain said it would give back more than £100m. Lidl opened four new stores in the UK in December, including in Southampton and Nottingham, creating 120 jobs. It is investing £1.3bn over the next two years to help to reach a target of 1,000 stores in the UK by 2023."
2021-01-13T09:02:56Z,business,Business,Just Eat Takeaway orders soar on back of European lockdowns,"Locked-down consumers across Europe ordered 57% more takeaways from the continent’s biggest delivery group in the final three months of 2020 than a year earlier. The huge leap in trade reported by Just Eat Takeaway.com was a further acceleration in growth from the 46% jump in the third quarter, as surging coronavirus cases resulted in countries across Europe reintroducing strict restrictions, keeping people at home.
In the UK, delivery orders surged by almost 400% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the same period of 2019, as many consumers were once again asked by the government to stay at home. Just Eat Takeaway, based in the Netherlands and one of the world’s largest online food delivery firms, said it had put “tremendous effort” into improving the Just Eat UK business. It said it had doubled its UK sales force compared with the previous year, driving increased choice of restaurants for customers. Food delivery groups have been a clear winner during the pandemic because restrictions have often prevented restaurants, pubs and cafes from serving diners on their premises. The group now expects Just Eat’s delivery orders in the UK market to overtake the total food orders of the third-largest firm. Jitse Groen, the chief executive of Just Eat Takeaway.com, said the firm’s investment programme had been successful and led to significant gains in market share in most countries. “The progress in the UK is particularly exciting: order growth of 58%, and we have increased our delivery orders nearly fivefold in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019,” he said. “In 2021, we will continue to invest in price leadership, improving our service levels and expanding our offering to restaurants and consumers.”
The results come just over a year after shareholders in Just Eat approved a £6.2bn merger with the Dutch food delivery firm Takeaway.com, creating one of the largest food delivery groups in the world, serving customers in 23 countries from Europe to New Zealand. In June, Just Eat Takeaway agreed to buy the US-based app Grubhub for $7.3bn (£5.8bn) in a deal that created the world’s largest food delivery service outside China. Just Eat Takeaway said it had obtained all regulatory approvals relating to the Grubhub transaction, as well as shareholder approval, and it hoped to complete the deal in the first half of 2021. Just Eat Takeaway and Grubhub together processed 593m orders in 2019 and have more than 70 million active customers globally."
2021-01-13T05:45:49Z,business,Business,Deutsche Bank joins companies cutting ties with Donald Trump,"Deutsche Bank became the latest large company to cut ties with Donald Trump, with the firm that has propped up the Trump Organization for two decades reportedly announcing it would no longer do business with the disgraced president. The German bank’s move – reported by the New York Times – follows Wednesday’s deadly attack on the US Capitol building by a mob of Trump supporters. The number of corporations disassociating themselves from Trump is now turning into an avalanche. Deutsche Bank has been Trump’s most important lender. The Trump Organization, fronted by his two older sons, owes the bank about $340m in outstanding loans. After a series of bankruptcies in the 1990s, it was the only bank willing to give Trump money. The relationship has survived various scandals. In 2008, Trump sued the bank’s real estate division after he defaulted on a $40m repayment, used to fund the construction of the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago. He accused Deutsche of co-causing the financial crisis and demanded $3bn in compensation. Instead of dumping him as a client, Deutsche’s private wealth division stepped in and loaned him more money to pay off the existing debt. Deutsche has resisted efforts by Democrats in the House and Senate to explain its relationship with Trump – and to clarify if Russian state banks or entities underwrote some of his debts. But the bloody events of last week and the looming threat of a second impeachment trial appear to have finally persuaded Deutsche’s managers to terminate its association with Trump. A Deutsche spokesperson refused to elaborate on Tuesday, telling the Guardian: “We decline to comment.” It is unclear if the decision extends to other members of the Trump family. The president’s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner are both Deutsche clients. In the last few days Twitter and Facebook have removed Trump from their platforms, with Trump’s Twitter account permanently suspended. Leading firms including Coca-Cola, the Marriott hotel chain, AT&T, Walmart and General Motors have said they will suspend political donations. The firms have said they will no longer give money to Republican representatives who have promoted Trump’s false claim that November’s election was rigged, and that Trump “won”. In the past they have donated to candidates from both parties. Several of the biggest banks in the US have said they too will suspend donations from their political action committees. They include JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley. According to Reuters, Deutsche had been looking to end its links with Trump since November, having grown tired of negative publicity. “We are proud of our constitution and stand by those who seek to uphold it to ensure that the will of the people is upheld and a peaceful transition of power takes place,” Christina Riley, the head of Deutsche’s US operations, wrote last week on LinkedIn. Another of Trump’s key lenders, Signature Bank, said it was closing his two personal accounts, which held a combined $5.3m in deposits. The New York bank has previously financed Trump’s Florida golf course. Ivanka Trump sat on its board. The bank called on Trump to quit. “We witnessed the President of the United States encouraging the rioters and refraining from calling in the National Guard to protect the Congress in its performance of duty,” it said in a statement. “At this point in time, to ensure the peaceful transition of power, we believe the appropriate action would be the resignation of the President of the United States, which is in the best interests of our nation and the American people”. On Sunday, the US Professional Golfers’ Association said it would no longer hold its championship in May 2022 at Trump’s New Jersey golf club. Its decision to scrap its deal with the Trump Organization reportedly left Trump “gutted”. “It has become clear that conducting the PGA championship at Trump Bedminster would be detrimental to the PGA of America brand, and would put at risk the PGA’s ability to deliver our many programmes, and sustain the longevity of our mission,” Jim Richerson, its president, said in a video statement. The Trump Organization responded on Sunday, saying: “We have had a beautiful partnership with the PGA of America and are incredibly disappointed with their decision. This is a breach of a binding contract, and they have no right to terminate the agreement.” The decision not to use Trump’s resort to host the second of four major tournaments on the tour’s calendar was a heavy loss to a president who has emphasised his portfolio of golf resorts and spent time – too much, his critics say – on the course while in office."
2021-01-13T05:00:01Z,business,Business,BlackRock holds $85bn in coal despite pledge to sell fossil fuel shares,"BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, holds investments worth $85bn in coal companies, a year after it promised to sell most of its shares in producers of the fossil fuel. A loophole in the asset manager’s policy means it is still allowed to hold shares in companies that earn less than a quarter of their revenues from coal, meaning it has held on to shares or bonds from some of the world’s biggest coalminers and polluters. Those companies included the Indian conglomerate Adani, the UK-listed commodities companies BHP and Glencore, and the German energy company RWE, according to research by Reclaim Finance and Urgewald, two campaign groups. Coal production is seen as one of the dirtiest ways of generating power, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change calculated that coal-fired power generation would have to be all but eliminated by 2050 to prevent global heating of more than 1.5°C. Investors have gradually taken note, and BlackRock’s coal divestment pledge, first made in January 2020, was hailed by activists as a victory. Environmental groups hoped that other asset managers would follow the lead of BlackRock, which managed assets worth $7.8tn (£5.7tn) at the end of September. The campaigners who carried out the latest research have now called for the CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, to divest fully from coal, including from its $24bn in assets in companies planning to expand coal production, such as Japan’s Sumitomo and Korea’s Kepco. “One year on, it’s hard to see Larry Fink’s sustainability commitment as anything other than greenwashing,” said Lara Cuvelier, a campaigner at Reclaim Finance. “If he really wants BlackRock to be a climate leader instead of a climate pariah, he needs to start aligning green words with green deeds, and direct BlackRock’s awesome financial power towards a sustainable future. After the hottest year on record, the bare minimum for BlackRock is to get out of coal once and for all.” BlackRock said it has completely divested all companies with more than a quarter of thermal coal revenues from active investment strategies, and that it offers clients the choice of excluding coal in its index products, which track lists of companies such as London’s FTSE 100.
However, in another loophole, where clients do not explicitly choose to exclude coal, BlackRock argues that it is unable to divest. Index products represent more than $5trn of its managed assets. A BlackRock spokesperson said: “Our conviction is that climate risk is investment risk. We ask all companies to disclose how their business model will be compatible with the transition to a low-carbon economy. Where we do not see sufficient progress, we take voting action.” BlackRock last year voted against directors at multiple energy companies on climate grounds, mainly because of lack of disclosure of emissions data. Fink promised the company would start to use the voting power of its vast assets in January 2020, a U-turn after previously arguing it would work mainly through engagement with company boards."
2021-01-13T00:01:54Z,business,Business,Morrisons to be first UK supermarket to pay minimum £10 an hour,"Morrisons has become the first UK supermarket to break the £10 an hour pay barrier just as the spotlight is being shone on poor pay levels in an industry where workers are in the frontline of the pandemic. The Bradford-based supermarket said it would guarantee pay of at least £10 an hour with the new deal, which starts in April, ushering in a significant pay increase for nearly 96,000 colleagues. Its minimum hourly pay now stands at £9.20 an hour. The good news from Morrisons came as new research from Citizens UK calculated that 45%, or 410,000 supermarket workers, including Morrisons and Sainsbury’s staff, now earn below the real living wage of £10.85 an hour in London and £9.50 an hour across the rest of Britain. The figure, set by the Living Wage Foundation, is based on everyday living costs in the UK. In April, the minimum wage set by the government will rise from £8.72 to £8.91. The research also highlighted the scale of the “pay gap” – the difference between the highest earners and the rest – for the UK supermarket industry with Tesco, Morrisons and Ocado among the top 10 FTSE350 companies with the biggest gulfs between boardroom and colleague pay. David Potts, Morrisons’ chief executive, described the company’s new pay rate as a “symbolic and important milestone that represents another step in rewarding the incredibly important work that our colleagues do up and down the country”. “Morrisons colleagues have earned their status as key workers, and this pay increase, many times over,” said Potts, who earned £4.2m last year. Morrisons is footing the majority of the extra wage costs but a quarter of the sum is coming from scrapping of the discretionary annual colleague bonus scheme. The retailer is also paying an inner London weighting of 85p and 60p for outer London. Joanne McGuinness, Usdaw national officer, said the £10 an hour basic rate it had negotiated was the “leading rate of the major supermarkets”. “It is a big step forward and I hope that the deal is supported by our members,” she said. “They provide the essential service of keeping the nation fed and deserve our support, respect and appreciation. Most of all they deserve decent pay and this offer is a welcome boost.” Nearly 7,000 companies are living wage employers but as yet no UK supermarket has been accredited by the Living Wage Foundation. Matthew Bolton, executive director of Citizens UK, said that despite the economic carnage caused by the pandemic, over 1000 companies had managed to find the money to become real living wage employers and “pay the lowest waged staff that bit extra”. “Yet not a single major supermarket pays all staff and contractors the living wage. It is unacceptable.”"
2021-01-12T22:30:52Z,business,Business,Labour vows to let National Audit Office scrutinise state spending,"Anneliese Dodds will pledge on Wednesday that a future Labour government would give a cast-iron guarantee of value for money to voters by insisting on outside scrutiny of the effectiveness of its spending. The shadow chancellor will use the prestigious Mais lecture to commit a future Keir Starmer-led administration to outside scrutiny by the National Audit Office (NAO) as part of an attempt to rebuild trust with voters who deserted the party at the 2019 election. Dodds will highlight the money wasted by the UK government on major projects over the past decade, with a particular focus on the spending during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as the £22bn projected cost of the test, trace and isolate programme. The government is on course to borrow about £400bn this year and while Labour has backed emergency measures to support the economy through its deepest recession in three centuries Dodds said a responsible approach to the public finances must include weighing up the quality and effectiveness of public spending. “Too often this is left out of the conversation altogether, leading to a situation where poor investment decisions are made and not subject to rigorous evaluation,” she will say. As chancellor, Dodds would invite the Comptroller and Auditor General to submit an annual report to parliament, bringing together the NAO’s findings throughout the year into a single assessment of the effectiveness of public spending in those areas the NAO had examined. “I would commit to government responding to that report – and indeed all NAO recommendations – with clear, tangible commitments to improve the quality of public spend. And I would ensure that at each year’s budget the government would set out its own assessment of the effectiveness of public spending, open to external challenge and scrutiny.
“This approach – hardwiring value for money and financial control into the budgetary process – would focus on real outcomes, not eye-catching announcements designed to raise expectations today, only for them to be dashed tomorrow. It is Labour’s cast-iron commitment to delivering value for money for the British people.” Dodds will say that the fact the UK’s recession has been the most severe of the G7 group of major industrial countries suggests there have been “significant flaws” in the government’s handling of the Covid crisis. “The Treasury has appeared continually focused on the need to extricate itself from the pandemic-related economic support packages it initially introduced – despite the fact that this has often been in direct contradiction to the public health evidence of continuing health challenges. This has led to a high degree of instability, which will harm the recovery, leading to greater scarring.”"

Oil has hit its highest level since the pandemic began, with Brent crude trading at $56.50 per barrel. Hopes of an economic revival this year, and Saudi Arabia’s pledge to cut output in February and March, boosted prices. Bitcoin recovered from its tumble on Monday, and is currently up around 2.7% at $34,823. That’s around 17% below last week’s peak, but still up a fifth so far this year. Bitcoin’s volatility, and claims it could succeed gold as a store of value, could lead to more regulatory pressures, one analyst warned. Some unlucky investors, meanwhile, remain locked out their wallets after losing crucial passwords.
The pound also rallied, up over one cent at $1.364, after the Bank of England’s governor dampened talk of negative interest rates. Andrew Bailey said there were ‘lots of issues’ around cutting borrowing costs below zero. Bailey also warned that the UK economy is going through a very difficult period, as the Covid-19 lockdown continues to hit growth.

2021-01-12T19:38:28Z,business,Business,Booming housebuilders should be last in the queue for Treasury handouts | Nils Pratley,"Big housebuilders were mostly agreed last autumn: their sector had rebounded from the first national lockdown but more subsidies were needed to avoid a crunching slowdown this spring. Would the chancellor like to extend his one-year stamp duty holiday on house purchases worth less than £500,000 in England and Northern Ireland? Or delay the post-March slimming of the help-to-buy scheme? If not, it was suggested, a cliff edge awaited. It sounded unconvincing at the time because big housebuilders, even in good times, like to frighten chancellors into crowd-pleasing measures that usually end up fattening their own profit margins. But, with the passage of a few months, the pleas sound even limper. Look at Tuesday’s update from Vistry Group, the former Bovis Homes. Sales in the last six weeks of 2020 were 20% higher than the previous year and there is no sign of looming slowdown after the stamp duty holiday expires at the end of March. Forward reservations for 2021 stand at healthy levels and prices are strong.
As for profits, Vistry will arrive at £140m-ish for 2020, a fall on 2019 but at the top end of expectations. And, since there has been “no impact” so far from the third lockdown, the company expects an increase in profits to £310m in 2021. Dividends are also coming back. Chief executive Greg Fitzgerald now says he is “less concerned” about the end of the stamp-duty holiday. Rishi Sunak, let’s hope, will draw the obvious conclusion: Treasury support is best directed at those sectors that are genuinely suffering in lockdown – think hospitality and events. We won’t hold our breath but it would be nice if housebuilding’s lobbyists conceded it is time to step off the subsidy treadmill. Moonpig float unlikely to fly at £1bn valuation Moonpig, apparently, is on a journey “to transition into a holistic online gifting companion”. Let’s hope the copywriting in its greetings cards is less clunky. There is a clue there, though, as to how this flotation will be marketed. Prepare to be told that Moonpig doesn’t merely flog cards and flowers online but is, in fact, a whizzy technology company. It is on that basis, one assumes, that private equity owner Exponent hopes Moonpig will be worth £1bn-plus. One can’t say pigs might fly because most online-only retailers tend to command lofty valuations. But, come on, this is hardly The Hut, a company whose cosmetics and nutrition products generate order sizes of rather more than Moonpig’s humble average of £7.10. Moonpig is still a neat business – operating profits in the year to last April were £33m on revenues of £173m. But how does that add up to a £1bn valuation? Yes, lockdown has boosted trade since then, but it’s hard to know how many new punters will hang around when shops reopen. Even if one assumes revenues of £300m in the current financial year, valuing Moonpig at more than three times as much looks a stretch. Kate Swann, former miracle-worker for shareholders at WH Smith, is a welcome presence in the chair, but her old shop runs a direct competitor called Funky Pigeon, so this is not one of those winner-takes-all online tales. Nice business, wrong price.
Business should back Autonomy founder Mike Lynch The UK’s extradition treaty with the US is shockingly unbalanced, almost everyone on this side of the Atlantic agrees. It is only slightly less shocking that the British business establishment has been so slow to offer support to Mike Lynch, the former Autonomy software founder who could be hauled over there to face charges arising out of a dispute with US firm Hewlett-Packard. Remember that allegations of improper accounting at Autonomy were investigated by the UK Serious Fraud Office, which decided there was insufficient evidence to bring charges. Yet the US Department of Justice continues its pursuit of Lynch, even though Autonomy was a UK company and was bought under UK takeover rules in 2011. An extradition hearing is set for next month. So well done Marcus Agius, Sir John Rose, Brent Hoberman and Davie Robbie – four senior British figures who signed a letter to the Times, alongside five former cabinet ministers and other MPs and peers, pointing out what’s at stake. In short: “Any British businessman or woman who finds themselves at odds with a powerful US company could face the same fate.” Lynch, a spiky individual, was never a popular figure on the UK corporate scene. But that ought to be irrelevant. British business should recognise his cause is important – and say so."
2021-01-12T19:31:17Z,business,Business,UK electricity prices hit record level as Britain's big freeze looms,"Britain’s electricity prices have soared to an all-time high with gas also surging to a three-year record ahead of sub-zero temperatures forecast for much of the UK next week. Energy prices have jumped as markets brace for freezing temperatures that are expected to boost demand for heating and electricity. The UK’s market price for electricity has risen to a new record of almost £1,500 a megawatt hour for Wednesday evening’s peak in demand after a string of power plant outages and low levels of renewable energy generation.
The UK price of gas for next month has jumped by a fifth to 80p a therm, its highest in almost three years, ahead of the cold snap which may keep temperatures low across Europe until early next month. Higher energy market prices typically lead to higher energy bills. Millions of households already face the risk of rising rates because the energy regulator has warned it may raise the cap on standard variable tariffs from April this year to help energy firms cover the cost of unpaid bills during the coronavirus crisis. Tim Dixon, an energy market expert at Cornwall Insight, said cold weather has been a driving factor in the UK’s rising demand for gas this year, which is 40% higher than the same period last year. “This is driven by increased heating demand but also by high demand from gas-fired power stations, a consequence of low windpower output and greater electricity demand,” he said. The UK’s growing reliance on fossil fuels has been made more expensive by a global boom in gas markets which has lifted the price of gas imported into northern Asia – on giant super-chilled tankers as liquified natural gas (LNG) - to a record high of $20.705 per million British Thermal Units last week. James Huckstepp, a gas analyst at S&P Global Platts, said the high prices offered by Asian gas buyers have diverted cargoes of LNG east, and forced European energy companies to rely on stocks of stored gas. “If below normal temperatures are sustained into February and March then the UK, which has more limited storage stocks, [will be] left particularly exposed to the tighter global LNG balance. Prices could easily rise another 50% to incentivise stronger Russian [gas] supply and to compete with Asia for LNG,” he said. National Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) has relied heavily on gas and coal plants in recent weeks to meet the UK’s demand for electricity. The control room issued an official warning that its buffer of spare electricity supplies would fall short by around 1,100MW on Wednesday evening, double the shortfall last week.
Adam Lewis, a partner at commodities trader Hartree Partners, said National Grid is already paying thousands of pounds to idle fossil fuel plants for each megawatt hour they generate to fill the gap left by power plants outages. “The more we run power plants that typically have low running hours the more likely I think we are to see such outages,” he said. Lewis added that electricity market prices would remain “very sensitive” to any further outages, drops in wind power, or disruption to the subsea cables connecting the UK to Europe’s power grids over the next week."
2021-01-12T19:13:18Z,business,Business,"Edinburgh Woollen Mill rescue deal saves 2,500 jobs and 300 stores","The high street retailers Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Ponden Home and Bonmarché have been bought out of administration in a rescue deal, which will save almost 2,500 jobs and 300 stores. The chains, part of the Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group controlled by the billionaire Philip Day, collapsed last year as Covid-19 restrictions led to financial difficulties. The Edinburgh Woollen Mill chain, known for its knitwear, as well as the homeware retailer Ponden Home and the fashion brand Bonmarché have been bought by Purepay Retail, a company backed by a consortium of international investors. Purepay has acquired all of the chains’ remaining stock, as well as the head office site and a distribution centre in Carlisle. The company will operate 246 Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home stores under licence, while 1,453 staff will transfer across to the new owner. Purepay will also take over about 1,000 Bonmarché staff and about 50 stores that operate under that fascia. The administrators FRP said the remaining 85 Edinburgh Woollen Mill stores and 34 Ponden Home stores would remain permanently closed, with 485 staff being made redundant. Those job losses are on top of the 860 announced when Edinburgh Woollen Mill chain and Ponden Home fell into administration in November, and 64 branches were closed down. Purepay is a secured creditor to the business, and Philip Day remains a secured creditor, although the rescue deal signals the end of Day’s control of the businesses. The Guardian understands that Day will effectively temporarily forego receiving money he can claim, so the new owners have working capital to operate the retailers. Tony Wright, the joint administrator at FRP, said the Purepay deal provided “the best chance to save stores and jobs”. However, he added: “With such little visibility on future trading conditions in UK retail, we regret that not all of Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home could be rescued. This has resulted in a significant number of redundancies at a particularly challenging time of year and period of economic uncertainty.” Philip Day’s Edinburgh Woollen Mill group owned a stable of brands, also including Jaeger and the low-cost clothing retailer Peacocks. Marks & Spencer announced on Monday it had bought the Jaeger fashion brand from administrators, in a deal that includes Jaeger’s stock and assets, but not its 63 stores. Peacocks remains in administration.
The Wakefield-based retailer Bonmarché, which sells fashion for women aged over 50, fell into administration in December for the second time in a year. Bonmarché’s administration was handled separately to Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Home, but it is included in the rescue deal. Day only bought the chain, which had 225 shops and about 1,500 staff, out of administration in February 2020. Day, who lives in Switzerland and owns a castle in Cumbria, initially built his retail empire by acquiring a string of businesses out of administration. Day’s Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group sounded the alarm last October that it was on the brink of collapse. Coronavirus restrictions and store closures proved the final challenge for retailers, including Debenhams and Philip Green’s Arcadia group, which were suffering from sluggish sales and online competition even before the pandemic hit."
2021-01-12T18:23:05Z,business,Business,Games Workshop sales surge as hobbies take off during lockdowns,"For the past year Britons have been told to stay home and save lives but while tabletop gamers have been stuck at home they have been busy fighting bloodthirsty wars from the safety of their bedroom or garden shed. Sales at Games Workshop, which sells fantasy miniatures and toy soldiers, soared by a quarter at the end of last year as fans escaped the grim reality of 2020 by losing themselves in its games, including its bestselling space fantasy game Warhammer 40,000 – or 40K as it is usually known. Given the human misery created by the pandemic the appeal of “the grim darkness of the 41st millennium” where “there is only war” can be hard to see. But Warhammer counts its fans in millions. Its Warhammer community webpage has 4.7 million users, its YouTube page has 400,000 followers and there are 280,000 on Instagram. Nonetheless Kevin Rountree, Games Workshop’s chief executive, said there had been a “step change” in demand over recent months for the figures and weaponry players used to build their armies. The company sold nearly £187m of games, figurines and paints in the six months to the end of November, up £38m on the year before, and profits were up more than 50% to £92m. Rountree described it as a “cracking performance”. The devotion felt by Games Workshop’s fanbase is likened to the cult following enjoyed by the likes of Lego, which has also enjoyed a sales boost as children and adults look for ways to entertain themselves at home during lockdowns. Games Workshop, however, is seen to attract an older, more male following. Its figures cost anywhere between £10 and £100-plus, while tiny pots of paint, with names such as “plaguebearer flesh”, start at about £3.
Over the past five years the Nottingham-based company has become a stock market sensation as investors woke up to the might of the Warhammer games franchise. Five years ago the shares were worth about £5, but today they change hands for more than £100 as the growing army of hobbyists pick up their paintbrushes. The company is now valued at £3.6bn – or £1bn more than Marks & Spencer. Games Workshop shuns publicity but on its website 50-year-old Rountree, who has worked for with the company for more than 20 years, says its mission is simple: “We make the best fantasy miniatures in the world and sell them globally at a profit. We intend to do this forever.” The company was started more than 40 years ago by three school friends: John Peake, Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson. The gaming fanatics shared a flat in west London where they started out selling handmade, classic wooden games before going on to open stores. After a management buyout in the 1990s the company listed on the stock exchange in 1994. The business is also clear, that despite running 529 stores, it is first and foremost a manufacturer. The shops, it says, are a recruiting ground for people with “our particular hobby gene”. Its factory in Lenton, Nottingham, pumps out tens of million of miniatures a year with the stores, which are often run by a single employee, used to show customers “how to engage with our hobby of collecting, painting and playing with our miniatures and games”. Games Workshop’s success during the pandemic, despite the turmoil caused by on-and-off store closures, has seen it repay the taxpayer support extended in the early days of the crisis. With its shops closed for long periods the company’s online sales were up 87%. “People have a lot more time on their hands and these models take a lot to time to do well,” says GlobalData retail analyst Zoe Mills, who points to high levels of engagement on Warhammer’s social media channels where fans share pictures of their painted miniatures. “In many ways Games Workshop is unique; there isn’t really another brand out there that offers the same sort of experience.” The huge lifestyle changes brought about by the pandemic have seen lots of Britons take up new and old hobbies, from baking to crafting to learning a language. “Warhammer is ultimately just another sort of hobby, although some people might see it as a more serious thing than that,” said Mills. “People are spending more time away from their phones and because are we not going into offices some people have got some extra time in the evenings that they don’t necessarily want to spend in front of the television.” Game makers rake in £3.6bn With the nation on lockdown for much of the last year the games sector received a pandemic boost as bored Britain stumped up a record £4bn-plus to keep entertained. The amount spent on digital gaming, from casual mobile phone gamers to hardcore players, hit £3.6bn last year. More than the amount spent by the record number of subscribers to services such as Netflix and Amazon, and triple the size of the UK music streaming market. Many gamers had also been conserving their cash for the arrival of new consoles from Sony and Xbox, which launched late last year and helped the spend on physical video games surge to £600m.
By far and away the biggest selling game of last year was FIFA 21, at 2.2m copies, well ahead of second-placed Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, which sold at 1.4m, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association. The other titles in the top five were by Grand Theft Auto V, Fifa 20 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Beyond the predominantly male-skewed list of the biggest titles there was also big demand for family fare, with cutesy Animal Crossing: New Horizons, where players become animal villagers to make an island paradise, proving a surprise hit. It ended the year as the UK’s sixth biggest-selling game. Sales of board games and jigsaw puzzles have also soared as traditional pursuits made a comeback to while away hours stuck at home. Early in the pandemic, the best-selling game was Monopoly Classic with Cluedo, Scrabble and card games UNO and Dobble also in the top 10, according to market research firm NPD. • This article was amended on 13 January 2021 to clarify Games Workshop prices."
2021-01-12T18:22:11Z,business,Business,Rashford free school meals row shines light on role of catering firms,"Compass Group already knows how sensitive the subject of school meals can be: in 2006 it faced the ire of the public after celebrity chef Jamie Oliver revealed that it was serving turkey twizzlers – with questionable nutritional content – in school canteens. The FTSE 100 company this week found itself at the centre of another controversy, after its subsidiary, Chartwells, was identified among the suppliers of food packages to families in place of free school meals during the latest coronavirus lockdowns. Images of the packages posted by parents on social media suggested they did not meet government guidelines. The Labour party and Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford both condemned the packages. Rashford spoke to Chartwells, which is a signed-up member of his campaign to end child food poverty, about the “unacceptable” amount of food provided. The row has highlighted once more the role of outsourcing companies in catering for the UK’s school children. Catering services are typically fragmented between many small providers, but Compass has profited from being one of the few catering companies with global scale and 550,000 employees. It also has political links to the Conservative party: Paul Walsh, a fan of big-game hunting who stepped down as chairman in December, donated to the party in 2010 and publicly backed David Cameron for prime minister in 2015. Since the start of 2016, Compass and its subsidiary have won contracts worth almost £350m for school catering, typically including free school meal provision, according to analysis by Tussell, a company that tracks public procurement. Among primary school caterers, Compass and Chartwells are easily the largest UK providers, Tussell said. Worcester-based Aspens Services was awarded contracts worth £75m between 2016 and 2020, followed by Cater Link with contracts worth £72m. During the pandemic Chartwells and other caterers have been forced to rapidly pivot to providing food at home to pupils eligible for free school meals, replacing an emergency system offering weekly £15 vouchers when the pandemic first forced all schools to close. As well as causing chaos for schools and pupils’ families, the pandemic has also dented Compass’s profits as canteens in offices, hospitals and military bases have remained shut around the world. Compass’s earnings before tax fell by 85% in the year to 30 September 2020 to £210m, but analysts expect them to recover fully by 2023 to more than £1.6bn. Compass chief executive, Dominic Blakemore, has highlighted that school catering wil be a key part of its recovery from the pandemic – highlighting the big financial rewards available for private companies in the public sector’s canteens. In an average year, the Compass CEO can earn 280 times more than the company’s dinner ladies. Blakemore’s fixed pay was cut in 2020 in recognition of the pandemic to a £1.2m salary, with no bonuses paid. He still received 54 times more than his median employee on £21,000. Compass was not legally required to report the pay ratio in 2019, when Blakemore’s pay was £4.7m. However, the High Pay Centre calculated that it was 283 times higher than the mean employee pay package. In a statement Compass Group said: “In our efforts to provide thousands of food parcels a week at extremely short notice we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance.” It said that it was adding to its food parcels after the government gave an additional emergency allowance of £3.50 a week for each child."
2021-01-12T16:46:37Z,business,Business,UK nuclear spacecraft could halve time of journey to Mars,"British spacecraft could travel to Mars in half the time it now takes by using nuclear propulsion engines built by Rolls-Royce under a new deal with the UK Space Agency. The aerospace company hopes nuclear-powered engines could help astronauts make it to Mars in three to four months, twice as fast as the most powerful chemical engines, and unlock deeper space exploration in the decades to come. The partnership between Rolls-Royce and the UK Space Agency will bring together planetary scientists to explore how nuclear energy could be used to “revolutionise space travel”, according to the government. Dr Graham Turnock, the chief executive of the UK Space Agency, said using nuclear power in space was “a gamechanging concept that could unlock future deep-space missions that take us to Mars and beyond”. “This study will help us understand the exciting potential of atomic-powered spacecraft, and whether this nascent technology could help us travel further and faster through space than ever before,” he said. The government hopes nuclear technology could transform space travel by providing plentiful energy to power the spacecraft as they travel further from the sun and are unable to make use of solar energy. Rolls-Royce has provided the nuclear propulsion technology used to power the Royal Navy’s submarine fleet for 60 years. The company hopes to build several small modular nuclear reactors on land too, to help meet the UK’s expected growth in demand for electricity. Dave Gordon, the head of Rolls-Royce’s defence division, said the UK’s “pioneering project” into nuclear space propulsion could make use of “a real niche UK capability” by building on Britain’s existing nuclear industry and supply chain. Britain’s plan to build atomic spacecraft will not be the first. US scientists first tested nuclear spacecraft technology in the Nevada desert in the 1950s and 1960s before the programme was cancelled in 1971. The US has undertaken several nuclear space programmes in recent decades. Late last year the US government issued a new space policy directive to advance Nasa’s nuclear developments. Amanda Solloway, the UK’s science minister, said nuclear power “presents transformative possibilities for space exploration”, and could help to create jobs. The study with Rolls-Royce could help to “propel our next generation of astronauts into space faster and for longer, significantly increasing our knowledge of the universe”, she said."
2021-01-12T16:00:25Z,business,Business,B&Q owner says lockdown DIY craze boosted festive sales,"Consumers forced to stay at home because of coronavirus restrictions have retained their appetite for lockdown DIY, driving festive sales at B&Q’s owner, Kingfisher. The group, which operates about 1,380 stores in the UK and Ireland, has reported that like-for-like sales surged by 16.9% between 1 November and 9 January, compared with a year earlier. Sales over the Christmas trading period slowed slightly compared with the previous three months, to the end of October, when they grew by 17.4%. Kingfisher blamed this on the closure of certain ranges in stores during the November lockdown in England, as well as stringent restrictions in France, where it owns the chains Castorama and Brico Dépôt. However, the group said sales accelerated in December at B&Q and Screwfix, reflecting continuing demand for home improvement products, news which helped Kingfisher into the top risers on the FTSE 100. Online sales also grew by more than 150% in the last two months, and click-and-collect services remain popular with customers who have continued the DIY craze that began during the first lockdown, spending their time repainting rooms, erecting fences or sprucing up the garden. Shoppers’ continued taste for DIY led the retailer to forecast annual profit before tax at the higher end of analysts’ expectations, estimated between £667m and £742m. Kingfisher’s chief executive, Thierry Garnier, said consumers’ renewed focus on their homes was positive for the business. “While the strength of our Q4 trading, to date, is reassuring, uncertainty over Covid-19 and the impact of lockdown restrictions in most of our markets continue to limit our visibility. Longer term, we are confident that the strategic and operational actions we are taking are building a strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth,” Garnier said. Kingfisher said that all of its UK and Irish stores remain open during the current lockdown, although certain areas within some branches had been temporarily closed to comply with trading restrictions, such as in Wales, where the sale of non-essential goods is not permitted. The retail group announced in December that it was joining some of the nation’s bigger supermarkets in returning £130m in business rates relief from the government.
“Thousands of people trying to work from home are going to continue to hear the banging through the wall from their neighbour’s DIY projects for quite some time,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. However, Mould warned that the gradual easing of coronavirus restrictions later in the year, after more people are vaccinated, may cool enthusiasm for home improvement. “The purple patch for DIY demand could start to fade as there will be other distractions in life,” Mould said."
2021-01-12T13:22:53Z,business,Business,The Hut Group lifts profit forecast after strong sales in Covid crisis,"The Hut Group, the recently floated online retail company run by billionaire Matthew Moulding, has upgraded its profit forecasts after strong sales at its beauty and sports nutrition brands during the coronavirus pandemic. The Manchester-based company which floated on the London Stock Exchange in September, said sales rose 51% to £558.7m during its fourth quarter, beating previous expectations of an increase of between 40% and 45%. The Hut Group (THG), which runs the websites Lookfantastic, Glossybox and Zavvi as well as beauty brands such as Espa and Illamasqua and the sports nutrition company Myprotein, said sales had benefited from strong demand for beauty products including self-tanning kits, vitamin tablets, Myvegan supplements and hand sanitiser during the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, THG said it was expecting 2021 revenues to be 30% to 35% ahead of last year’s, up from its previous estimate of 20% to 25%. Matthew Moulding, the co-founder who serves as executive chairman and chief executive, told analysts and investors that the “key standout was the beauty division”. He said the company had hired 3,000 people, largely within the UK, taking its global workforce to 10,000, and opened five new warehouses across the world. Black Friday had been strong, he said, and the firm’s websites typically got 20 times their usual orders in a day. The Hut Group made a strong stock market debut in mid-September, when its shares rose by a quarter to 625p. After the success of the stock market debut, Moulding was handed one of the biggest payouts in UK corporate history – an £830m share award. The shares rose 1% to 798p on Tuesday, giving the firm a market value of £7.75bn – up from £5.6bn on the first day of trading – and valuing Moulding’s 25% stake at nearly £2bn.
Last month, THG bought the US beauty website Dermstore and it has struck partnerships with the fragrance brand Creed, and GlaxoSmithKline for its vitamins portfolio in the UK. The Hut Group was founded in 2004 by the former Phones4u executives Moulding and John Gallemore to sell CDs online, and expanded rapidly by exploiting a now closed tax loophole that allowed companies to avoid VAT on small goods, including CDs and DVDs, by posting them to the UK from the Channel Islands. The firm sought to improve corporate governance by appointing another independent director, taking the number of independents on the eight-member board to four. The Hut Group has been criticised for handing Moulding both the executive chairman and chief executive roles, along with a “golden share” that allows him to block hostile takeover attempts for three years."
2021-01-12T11:57:17Z,business,Business,"UK economy facing its 'darkest hour' due to lockdown, warns Bank governor","The UK economy is facing its “darkest hour” due the latest Covid-19 lockdown, which is likely to delay the recovery, the Bank of England governor has warned. In comments on Tuesday that echoed warnings from the chancellor, Rishi Sunak a day earlier that the economy “is going to get worse before it gets better”, Bailey said the UK would bounce back, but only after the lockdown had ended and concerns about the spread of the virus had receded. Referencing Winston Churchill’s use of the phrase in 1940 following the evacuation of Dunkirk, he said: “There’s an old saying about the darkest hour is the one before dawn.” He added: “[We’re] in a very difficult period at the moment and there’s no question that it’s going to delay, probably, the trajectory.” In an online speech to the Scottish Chambers of Commerce he said the shape of the recovery, while delayed, would broadly follow the forecast made by the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) last November. Bailey said the unemployment rate, which he previously expected to peak at about 7%-8% in the summer, would now be lower after the government extended its job protection scheme and other measures to safeguard household incomes. However, the rate remained likely to rise above the 4.9% that official figures estimate for the three months to October. Amid concerns that the UK will suffer a double dip recession after expected falls in GDP during the last quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, Bailey said the figure was already higher despite the extra measures that Sunak has announced, including a further £4.5bn last week for the hospitality sector. “Our best guess nationwide is probably it’s around 6.5%,” Bailey said. The MPC meets early next month to discuss how the central bank can help to protect the economy during the lockdown, including whether interest rates should be cut to below zero – a move that could ease borrowing costs on households and businesses. Bailey said he was sceptical that a cut from the current all-time low of 0.1%would be painless, arguing it could make the situation worse. He said there were “lots of issues” with cutting interest rates into negative territory and such a move could hurt banks. “In simple economics and maths terms, there is nothing to stop it at all,” he said. “However there are a lot of issues with it.” At its meeting in November, the nine-strong committee voted to launch a fresh £150bn stimulus package in response to the economy’s flagging recovery, taking the total amount of electronic money pumped into the economy to £895bn. In December the committee said it would wait for further evidence of a downturn – and consider the impact of a Brexit trade deal – before committing extra funds to the stimulus package. Bailey said the Bank had seen anecdotal evidence of disruption caused by Britain’s departure from the European Union at the turn of the year, but it was unclear how persistent the delays would prove beyond the first month of the year. On Monday, one of the MPC’s nine committee members said she believed the likelihood of a further downturn following the third lockdown meant negative rates would benefit the UK economy and help it make a faster recovery.
Silvana Tenreyro said central banks in Japan and the eurozone had cut rates to below zero to support borrowing and she was likely to vote for the UK to follow suit when a review by the Bank was completed. Bailey said negative rates – the subject of a feasibility review by the central bank – would complicate high street banks’ efforts to be profitable and force them to restrict lending. Officials at the central bank fear that negative rates will trigger a flight of savings, depleting the reserves of commercial banks and forcing them to cut back lending. Bailey argued that it was not easy to draw a direct parallel with similar action in the eurozone, where banks have mostly passed on the benefits to large businesses while keeping household savings and mortgage rates at higher levels."
2021-01-12T10:23:25Z,business,Business,Royal Mail reveals 28 areas where Covid-19 has limited deliveries,"Royal Mail has published a list of 28 areas across the UK that no longer receive regular post because many staff have contracted coronavirus or are self-isolating. People living in areas such as Daventry, Barnsley, Leeds, Margate and large parts of London – including Highbury, Wandsworth and Hornsey – are receiving limited deliveries. Royal Mail said: “Despite our best efforts and significant investment in extra resource, some customers may experience slightly longer delivery timescales than our usual service standards. “This is due to the exceptionally high volumes we are seeing, exacerbated by the coronavirus-related measures we have put in place in local mail centres and delivery offices to keep our people and customers safe. In such cases, we always work hard to get back to providing our usual level of service as quickly as we can.” Customers have reported delays to postal services on social media sites including Twitter in recent days, beyond the busy Christmas period. A number of Royal Mail staff who work at the delivery office in Lincoln are self-isolating after three confirmed cases at the site. The delivery office in Margate carried out a deep clean last week after three members of staff tested positive for Covid-19 and about 20 people are now isolating. The delivery issues have raised concerns that letters sent to people over 80 inviting them to be vaccinated against coronavirus may not get to them in time. Ilford in east London is one of the areas with limited deliveries. Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North, tweeted on Sunday:
In Hornsey in north London, there have been delays of up to six weeks and some post and parcels sent in November have still not arrived. Residents have contacted the local MP, Catherine West, who was told by Royal Mail that before Christmas, Covid-related absence levels at the delivery centre were about 30%, while last week they were 11%. Royal Mail said mail deliveries were taking place “at least every other day” in Hornsey and it had retained agency workers hired over Christmas to help clear the backlog. West said at the weekend she would be meeting Royal Mail chiefs this week.
Royal Mail’s list of areas with limited deliveries: Ashford (TN23-TN27) Barnsley (S70, S71, S72 and S75) Basildon (SS13-SS16) Bow (E3) Bury St Edmunds (IP28-IP33) Chelmsford (CM1-CM3) Christchurch (BH23) Daventry (NN11) Debden (IG7-IG10) Enfield (EN1-EN3) Grays (RM16-RM20) Hampton (TW12) Highbury (N5) Hornsey (N8) Horsham (RH12, RH13) Ilford (IG1-IG6) Leeds City (LS1-LS5) Lewisham (SE13) Magherafelt (BT45, BT46) Margate (CT7-CT9) Rugeley (WS15) Somerton (TA11) South Ockendon (RM15) South Woodford (E18) Lower Holloway (N7) Wandsworth (SW18) Wellington (TA21) Widnes (WA8)"
2021-01-12T00:26:36Z,business,Business,Sainsbury's joins Morrisons in enforcing mask rule for customers,"Sainsbury’s has joined Morrisons in saying it will enforce the wearing of masks in its supermarkets, as retailers call on the police to enforce regulations inside stores. Trained security guards would be posted at shop entrances, Sainsbury’s said, to challenge any customers not wearing a mask or shopping in groups, and the number of customers allowed into stores at any one time had been significantly reduced. Simon Roberts, the supermarket’s chief executive, said: “The vast majority of customers are shopping safely, but I have also seen some customers trying to shop without a mask and shopping in larger family groups. Please help us to keep all our colleagues and customers safe by always wearing a mask and by shopping alone.” The comments came after Morrisons broke ranks with rivals by saying it would strengthen its policy on masks in particular, after the government reportedly raised concerns that falling compliance with lockdown restrictions might be contributing to the rapid rise in Covid-19. It is understood that Morrisons is prepared to call in police as a last resort if customers do not comply with requests to wear a mask. Some other British supermarkets have said they will require help from the police if the government wishes to increase the enforcement of lockdown rules, because most shop workers are not trained to handle confrontations with customers.
Morrisons said it would continue to offer face coverings to customers who had forgotten them and who were not exempt from wearing them for medical reasons. David Potts, Morrisons chief executive, said: “Those who are offered a face covering and decline to wear one won’t be allowed to shop at Morrisons unless they are medically exempt. Our store colleagues are working hard to feed you and your family – please be kind.” The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said on Monday that it was “essential [that] police support the work being done by retailers”. However, multiple police sources said officers would not get involved in ensuring shoppers are wearing masks. “We won’t be doing that,” one senior police leader said, adding: “Do people really want the police telling you, ‘That’s not above your nose’? There are no extra officers, everything else [crime] is still happening. Where is the greater risk – do you put two people in a supermarket not wearing masks before a woman suffering domestic violence. “You need clearer, consistent messaging, not new rules and more enforcement.” Supermarkets have had measures in place since March to try to slow the spread of the virus, including mandatory face masks for everyone other than those with medical exemptions and social distancing. Some stores are also limiting the number of customers who can enter. However, increasing enforcement of the rules in supermarkets was one of the options being considered amid rapid increases in the number of people in hospital with Covid-19, according to government sources cited by the Telegraph. More than 6,300 people died after testing positive for Covid-19, according to government data covering the seven days up to 10 January.
Supermarkets, which are classed as essential retailers, stress that they are following government rules. The BRC, which represents most of the UK’s largest food retailers, including Sainsbury’s, Asda, Waitrose and Morrisons, said data from the government’s scientific advisers showed that retail was safe, and added that its members had spent hundreds of millions of pounds on safety measures such as Perspex screens and additional cleaning. Andrew Opie, the BRC’s director of food and sustainability, said: “Supermarkets continue to follow all safety guidance, and customers should be reassured that supermarkets are Covid-secure and safe to visit during lockdown and beyond. Customers should play their part too by following in-store signage and being considerate to staff and fellow shoppers. “While enforcement of face coverings is the responsibility of the police, retailers continue to do what they can to encourage their use throughout stores. Sadly, this has led to a sharp rise in incidents of violence and abuse against shop workers, which is why it is essential that police support the work being done by retailers.” Supermarket industry sources said there was little more that retailers could do to increase enforcement without police help. “If they’re going to make it law, their officers need to be in our stores making it law,” said one person at a large retailer."
2021-01-12T00:01:24Z,business,Business,Biggest fall in UK retail sales since 1995 despite online boom,"UK retail sales suffered the biggest decline in 25 years last year as the closure of non-essential shops during lockdowns more than outweighed the online spending boom fuelled by Covid-19. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said total sales fell by 0.3% last year from the level in 2019 – the worst performance since records began in 1995 – reflecting the impact of government lockdowns and shifting consumer spending trends. However, the overall drop in spending masks an explosion in sales for some shops, and a dramatic collapse for others. Amid a decline in spending in pubs, restaurants and hotels during the crisis, sales of food bought from shops increased by 5.4% on the year. However, sales of all other products fell 5% from a year earlier.
While online sales were boosted during lockdown as consumers largely stayed away from the high street, sales of non-food items in physical shops collapsed by 24%. The decline in sales volumes comes after the first annual fall since 1995 in 2019, when years of weak wage growth hurting households’ finances and Brexit fears led to a 0.1% drop in retail sales compared with 2018 levels. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said Christmas had offered little respite for retailers, as many shops were forced to shut during the peak trading period. Calling on the government to provide fresh financial support for the sector, she said: “With shops still closed for the foreseeable future, costing stores billions in lost sales, many retailers are struggling to survive.” Despite the sharp drop in non-food sales, the latest figures from the BRC showed that total retail sales rose by 1.8% in December compared with the same month a year ago. It said there was a rise in the purchase of food-based gifts at Christmas, as many shoppers bought what they could from shops that remained open. The volume of food and drink sales was the highest for festive spending on record. Separate figures from Barclaycard – Britain’s biggest credit card provider – showed that consumer spending fell by 2.3% in December as tougher government controls hampered the high street and hospitality sectors in the pivotal Christmas period. It said online retail increased by 52.2% in December as Britons shopped from home, while tighter restrictions led to in-store retail declining 8.3%. Barclaycard records almost half of UK transactions, and differs from the BRC figures because it monitors spending in shops, online and elsewhere across the economy – such as in pubs, restaurants and hotels. With few opportunities to socialise before Christmas, sales in pubs and bars fell by more than 70%, while spending in restaurants plunged 65%. Physical retailers – such as department stores and clothes shops – also recorded declines of 15% and 7% respectively.
Raheel Ahmed, head of consumer products at Barclaycard, said: “With the latest government guidance to stay at home and a vaccine rollout on the horizon, we are all hopeful of a brighter and more prosperous year ahead. “Yet, for now, the reality of lockdown life remains and it’s once more a hugely challenging time for high-street retailers as well as the hospitality, leisure and travel industries.”"
2021-01-11T20:08:45Z,business,Business,Shay Segev’s defection to DAZN won’t help Entain stave off MGM,"There’s an unwritten rule in the world of chief executives that you don’t jump ship after six months in post just because another company has made you a megabucks pay offer. And you definitely don’t resign as boss of a FTSE 100 company in the middle of a takeover battle. Shay Segev at Entain, owner of Ladbrokes and Coral, doesn’t seem to have got the memo. He’s off to DAZN, a sports streaming platform backed by billionaire Sir Len Blavatnik that is prepared to throw big bucks at senior recruits in its attempt to become “the Netflix of sport”. “We cannot match the rewards he has been offered,” says the Entain chairman, Barry Gibson. Entain’s board and 25,000 staff are entitled to be furious. Segev was an internal promotion last July and billed as a tech supremo who would also make Entain respectable after the free-wheeling years under founder Kenny Alexander. He outlined his strategy of “sustainability, growth and innovation”, plus a change of corporate name from GVC, as recently as November. The haste to embrace Blavatnik’s zillions is indecent. Entain will – rightly – hold Segev to his six-month notice period and cancel his crop of unvested performance shares, worth a potential £9.6m at the current share price (a clue to quite how much DAZN must be offering). Of more importance is the effect on the takeover battle with MGM Resorts, whose £8.1bn bid Entain rejected only last week – a rejection Segev says he fully supports. On one hand, MGM itself might be slightly unnerved by the resignation. It is more likely, however, that the bidder will use it to portray Entain as a rudderless organisation whose bosses suspect the company’s days of independence are numbered. In reality, Entain’s board should continue to resist anything but a truly over-the-top offer from MGM, but Segev’s rush to the exit doesn’t make the task easier. One could take the view that it’s naive or old-fashioned to expect loyalty from hired-hand chief executives. But there are limits: you don’t jump while you are supposed to be leading a takeover defence. Dr Martens flotation: the shine is likely to come off It was a shoo-in that Dr Martens would sprinkle the words “iconic” and “icon” across its announcement of a plan to float on the London Stock Exchange. Sure enough, there were nine mentions in the first four pages. Everyone loves a tale of “brand heritage”. It will be a disappointment if a photo of The Who’s Pete Townshend in booted-up mode does not adorn the prospectus. But the other iconic brand on display is that of the seller, Permira, the private equity firm. The fame in its case lies in its history of shunting on to the stock market over-indebted British companies that subsequently plunge in value. The mugs who bought shares in the AA and Saga at flotation are still counting the cost. Dr Martens looks a superior operation, it should be said. For starters, Permira hasn’t cranked up its borrowings to nose-bleed levels. Growth is also easier to spot. The business sold 6.9m pairs of Docs in the year to March 2018 but 11.1m in its most recent financial year, when top-line profits were £184m. Even so, Permira is hoping to sell for £3bn-plus, if the pricing whisper is correct, having bought Dr Martens from family ownership for a mere £300m in 2014. No doubt the operation has been made slicker in that time, but a tenfold gain in seven years is going some. Think of the potential in China, runs one version of the sales pitch. OK, but the point about the Dr Martens brand appeal, surely, is that not everyone wears it. Some scepticism on pricing is required. Don’t bet on digital currencies Timely advice from Financial Conduct Authority: be prepared to lose all your money if you invest in investment schemes tied to digital currencies. On cue, bitcoin produced another example of price silliness. You could have lost 25% by getting your timing wrong in the last couple of days. Regulators seem mostly concerned about unregulated firms pushing implausible promises of sky-high returns. Quite right too. The wild marketing around bitcoin and its imitators is the surest sign the crypto craze is speculation on stilts. It’s worth saying time and again: you almost certainly won’t be covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if you lose your shirt. Nor would you deserve a penny of recompense."

The FTSE 250 retailer had been considered a frontrunner to snap up Jaeger after its owner, Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, fell into administration in November along with other chains including Peacocks. The group, which was controlled by entrepreneur Philip Day, fell into severe financial difficulty after the Covid-19 pandemic forced it to close its doors. Jaeger employed 347 people across 76 stores and concessions before the administration, but subsequently closed 13 locations, making 97 people redundant. It remained unclear whether any jobs would be saved in the M&S deal, with negotiations continuing. Across all of Day’s brands the administration put nearly 4,800 jobs at risk. For M&S the acquisition comes as part of its efforts to sell a wider selection of brands online, a strategy that will pit it directly against its larger FTSE 100 rival, Next. M&S has already brought in other brands including environment-conscious clothing company Nobody’s Child, dressmaker Ghost and toy specialist the Early Learning Centre. Richard Price, managing director of M&S’s clothing and home division, said: “We have bought the Jaeger brand and are in the final stages of agreeing the purchase of product and supporting marketing assets from the administrators of Jaeger Retail Limited.” Jaeger’s business also included the formalwear chains Jacques Vert and Austin Reed, but those brands were also not included in the deal, and will continue to be owned by Day’s Dubai-based holding intellectual property company, which did not enter administration. FRP, the administrators for Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, declined to comment."
2021-01-11T18:38:06Z,business,Business,Rishi Sunak warns UK economy will get worse before it gets better,"Rishi Sunak has warned Britain’s economic performance will worsen before the coronavirus vaccine helps to improve the outlook for jobs and growth. The chancellor told the House of Commons that, while the vaccine provides hope, there was a need for tougher national restrictions to contain the spread of the virus and that this would have a “further significant economic impact”. “While the vaccine provides hope, the economy is going to get worse before it gets better,” he said.
Speaking in the Commons for the first time since the government launched a third national lockdown, Sunak said the Treasury’s emergency support measures were helping to protect jobs and businesses and that the vaccine was the “most important economic lever” to reboot the economy. But despite calls from business leaders, trade unions and Labour for a fresh package to match the challenges posed by the latest restrictions, the chancellor only restated the support now available under previously announced schemes. Sunak said he was confident that “this comprehensive support” – which totals more than £280bn in higher spending and tax cuts since the pandemic began – would help Britain through until the spring.
Indicating that any major changes would be left until the budget on 3 March, the chancellor said there were signs of “underlying resilience” in the British economy, including a rise in household savings to record levels, evidence of firms improving their cash buffers, and the new trading partnership with the EU removing Brexit uncertainty. It comes after Sunak announced £4.6bn in new grants for firms in the hardest-hit sectors of the economy last week. The furlough scheme – which has been used to subsidise the wages of more than 9m jobs at more than 1m companies since its launch, at a cost of more than £46bn so far, has also been extended until the end of April.
However, the chancellor dropped a heavy hint that he would soon scale back high levels of government spending to tackle record government borrowing, saying the public finances were “badly damaged and will need repair”. In an update devoid of new announcements, he said: “The road ahead will be tough. Now is the time for responsible management of our economy, taking the difficult but right long-term decisions for our country.” Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, criticised Sunak for not announcing fresh measures. “Today the chancellor appears out of ideas, urging us to look to the sunny uplands but providing nothing new. The purpose of an update is to provide us with new information, not to repeat what we already know.”"

In London, the FTSE 100 has closed 74 points lower at 6798 points, a drop of 1.1% today. That still leaves the Footsie up over 5% this year, after last week’s roaring start. Covid-19 fears hit stocks, with catering firm Compass down 4.3%, property firm Land Securities off 3.6% and drinks producer Diageo dropping 2.6%. They all suffer from the pandemic lockdowns, and their impact on hospitality, pubs and restaurants, and offices. JD Sports ended the day up 3.8%, having hit record highs today after predicting profits would beat expectations. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC dropped by 0.8%, while Spain’s IBEX lost 0.6% and Italy’s FTSE MIB dipped by 0.3%. David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets UK, says health concerns have encouraged dealers to book profits today. Last week, stock markets enjoyed very bullish moves on the back of the belief that Joe Biden’s administration will reveal new stimulus. The FTSE 100 was sent to a 10 month high while the DAX registered a new record high. Relatively mild worries about Covid-19 cases are weighing on the mood today. The scale of the losses in stocks suggests that traders would prefer to take some money out of the markets as opposed to panic selling. On the FTSE 100, mining stocks like Rio Tinto, BHP Group and Anglo American are some of the largest fallers in terms of index points. Housebuilders, oil, hospitality, travel and transport stocks are in the red too. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has now rebounded to $32,200 -- a drop of nearly $8,000, or 20%, compared with Friday night.

2021-01-11T16:45:41Z,business,Business,"Cut UK interest rate below zero to aid growth, says Bank policymaker","Cutting the UK’s official interest rate below zero would be good for growth and could be done without crippling commercial banks, a Bank of England policymaker has said. Silvana Tenreyro, one of the nine members of Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee, said negative rates had worked in other countries and would assist the UK’s recovery from its Covid-19 slump. In an online speech to the University of the West of England, Tenreyro rejected the argument that the profitability of banks would be adversely affected if the Bank cut the official cost of borrowing – bank rate – from a record low of 0.1% to below zero. The Bank is looking at the technical feasibility of negative rates for Britain’s financial system, and is expected to publish its views on this after next month’s policy meeting. Members of the MPC are divided on whether any fresh stimulus should be provided by increasing the purchase of assets under the quantitative easing programme or by following the recent example of Denmark, Sweden and the eurozone and pushing rates below zero. Tenreyro said she did not want to prejudge the Bank’s review or whether the economy would need additional support but made it clear that she would be in favour of negative rates if the matter was ever put to the MPC. “My overall assessment is that, while we can never have complete certainty, negative interest rates should with high likelihood boost UK growth and inflation. Cutting bank rate to its record low of 0.1% has helped loosen lending conditions relative to the counterfactual (of no policy change), and I believe further cuts would continue to provide stimulus.”
She added that despite the help provided by the Bank and the Treasury, unemployment was likely to rise in the coming months and it would take time to make up ground lost during the pandemic. “All else equal, looser monetary policy can help the economy recover faster, bringing inflation back to target, while also preventing some of the job losses and business failures that could otherwise reduce potential output in future. “It is possible that more stimulus be needed to do so at an appropriate pace. If that is the case, having negative rates in our toolbox will, in my view, be important.” There was “no clear evidence” from elsewhere that negative rates had reduced bank profits overall, with some studies finding a boost to bank profitability as a result of a faster-growing economy."
2021-01-11T16:30:23Z,business,Business,Australia's economy is faring better than most – but that’s not saying much | Greg Jericho,"As we begin 2021, the economic questions mostly involve wondering when will things return to normal and what that normal will look like. The worst is behind us, but we have a way to go yet to be out of recession and a great deal further to go before we can suggest the economy is strong. While border closures and suburban-area lockdowns remain we will continue to see odd economic happenings. The latest retail trade figures are a case in point.
In November, as Victoria came out of its lockdown, retail spending in that state rose 22% in one month. Even the rest of the nation’s growth of 2.6% was well above the long-term median monthly growth of 0.4%. Australia is doing quite well compared with other nations, and yet that is not saying a great deal. Using US economist Claudia Sahm’s measure of recessions, which compares the unemployment rate with the lowest point of the past 12 months, the US is in a worse situation than Australia, but both nations are doing as badly as they were in the depths of the GFC:
While unemployment is a key indicator, given the moves to keep people employed technically through the jobkeeper payment, I think the underutilisation rate is more resonant of the real situation. In November, 11.7% of men in the labour force were either unemployed or underemployed and 15.2% of women were so situated. While both were much lower than they were last June/July they remain well above the pre-Covid record highs:
And when using underutilisation rather than unemployment to measure recessions, in November things were as bad as they ever have been:
The situation however is not even across the country. Victoria and New South Wales remain the worst hit, but Western Australia is essentially out of recession – and doing better than it was a couple years ago as it dealt with the end of the mining boom:
Similarly, South Australia is performing as well now as it was before the pandemic hit.
We see this also in the decline and recovery of hours worked per capita in each state. Adults in Western Australia are now working more hours per month on average than they were before the pandemic (as is the case in the ACT), while Victoria has a long way to recover:
When we look at the situation across age groups – every age remains in recession, with the 25-34 year olds in the worst shape:
So things remain bad, if better than they were. But what can we look to as a sign that things are back to normal?
I have long been using the measure of hours worked per capita to chart the state of the economy. Back in May I suggested that “until the level of actual hours worked is back to where it was before the shutdown, no one should be thinking about austerity”. That remains my position and while the November level of 83.9 hours is a massive improvement on the despairing level in May last year, it is still awful:
It deserves repeating that the level of hours worked in November was as bad as ever experienced since the 1990s recession. At any other point in the past 25 years we would be viewing the state of affairs in November as a sign of an economy in complete distress. It’s why the commentary that Australia is no longer in a recession because GDP grew in the September quarter is quite laughable. Another aspect to keep watch over is the percentage of men aged 25-64 who are working full-time. Every recession since the 1980s has seen this level fall and not recover. Even prior to the pandemic, the level of prime-aged men working full-time was below the post-1990s recession median of 74%, let alone the mining-boom peak level of 75.9%:
The current level is around a full percentage point lower than the pre-pandemic point, but since 2012 there has been a historically low number of men in this group working full-time. If we are to use GDP to look at recessions and economic performance, we could do worse than use the adjusted nominal GDP growth, which involves adding annual real GDP and inflation growth. Given a target average GDP growth of 2.75% to 3.25% and the Reserve Bank’s inflation target of 2% to 3%, we should be aiming for this adjusted nominal GDP growth to be at least 4.75%. In September it was minus 3.1%:
And again, we should note that prior to the pandemic both GDP and inflation growth had long been below par. It is a good reminder that, while we are doing better than we were, we need to do much more. Just getting back to where we were before the pandemic also remains a decidedly poor aim."
2021-01-11T15:25:05Z,business,Business,Questions raised over The Hut Group boss's landlord role,"A year ago Matthew Moulding – undoubtedly one of the business names of 2020 – was perhaps best known for founding a controversial VAT-free online sales operation for Tesco, Asda, WH Smith, Dixons and Best Buy. Until 2011, he based certain operations in the Channel Islands to take advantage of European tax rules that exempt imports below £18 from VAT, until the loophole was closed by the then chancellor, George Osborne, in his budget of that year. Nine years on and Moulding is a self-made billionaire, having floated his company The Hut Group (THG) on the London Stock Exchange in September. His 25% stake is worth about £1.9bn. THG owns a range of online beauty and nutrition brands including Espa and Myprotein, and provides e-commerce technology to firms such as Unilever. Its stock market debut was followed by news that Moulding had been handed one of the biggest payouts in UK corporate history – an £830m share award – while numerous profile articles feted him for donating his £750,000 salary to charity and creating scores of millionaires within THG, all set against his backstory of growing up in a house with an outside toilet near Burnley, Lancashire. Life in that two-up-two-down appears light years away from now. When Moulding, 48, and his wife, Jodie, bought their Cheshire home for £5m in 2014, the estate agent’s brochure showed it was not just the toilets that were situated inside. The home also boasted an indoor swimming pool, a private cinema and a “nightclub” room. But the building forms only a small part of the Moulding’s property empire.
As part of THG flotation, the company sold off many of its property assets to Moulding, leaving it to pay its founder, chief executive and chairman £19m in rent annually. THG, which releases a quarterly trading update on Tuesday, said Moulding had pledged all annual profits from his new property arm to charity, although it later said that, because of the debt on the portfolio, it would be “barely income generating” this year. The company did not disclose what the property portfolio was worth, with the listing document outlining how THG is renting from him 15 warehouses and offices, including giant facilities in Warrington and another near Wrocław in Poland, as well as a string of office blocks in Northwich. Also detailed in the list are two upmarket Manchester hotels – King Street Townhouse and Great John Street – as well as the Hale Country Club & Spa, for which THG pays Moulding’s company a combined annual rent of £2.35m. The venues are used to promote and use THG’s healthcare brands, with Hale’s gym rebadged as its sports nutrition line, Myprotein. However, an analysis by the Guardian has found further recently acquired properties in Moulding’s portfolio that are being developed as part of THG’s hospitality business. There are office buildings on Manchester’s Kennedy Street and Booth Street, where the grand architecture is a relic of the city’s central role in the Industrial Revolution, plus a residential address in Altrincham, Greater Manchester. The company said the Manchester properties were “being converted into additional rooms and spa facilities” for the King Street Townhouse hotel, while the Altrincham home is located next to the Hale Country Club and was “being converted into accommodation to support the spa weekend offering”. THG said the Altrincham site would “potentially be leased [by the company from Moulding] in the future”. All of which has raised questions among the British investment community, which has become increasingly keen over the past few years in taking a proactive look at the policy side of how public companies are run. A note on THG’s corporate governance structures, which was published at the end of November by the shareholder advisory consultancy Pirc, said: “[THG] reorganised the business to make Mr Moulding landlord of the firm’s property empire, securing him with £19m in rent a year, but more importantly, dis-incentivising the company from negotiating down rental rises which is what so many counterparts have been forced to do during the Covid-19 pandemic.” Sarah Wilson, the chief executive of corporate governance advisory firm Manifest, said: “Related party transactions are a potential hazard that creates risk. Directors should be clear about who they are working for and are accountable to. ‘Side-gigs’ create unnecessary complexity. In addition to getting an eye-watering bonus payout and private security guards, he’s getting property revenues without the shareholder oversight? This is a governance accident in the waiting.” A spokesperson for THG said the leases between Moulding and the company were signed at “arm’s length” and that there was “no obligation for THG to renew or always use the Propco on future property projects”. She added that the arrangements are not unique and “a number of other listed companies have used similar structures where founders/key executives own the freeholds of operating properties”.
Perhaps the best-known recent example of a powerful boss moonlighting as a major landlord to a firm he was running, was Adam Neumann, the founder of WeWork. For various reasons, that saga did not end well, with Neumann ousted from WeWork in 2019 after battles with investors over corporate governance and the company’s valuation. THG said: “The sale of the Propco business to Mr Moulding was agreed on arm’s length terms with the independent non-execs’ and professional shareholders’ oversight. Mr Moulding paid the market value as independently valued by a global top tier accountancy practice appointed by THG on behalf of all shareholders. “The transaction removed in excess of £200m of debt from THG’s balance sheet immediately which increases to in excess of £400m over the near term as THG completes its infrastructure roll-out programme globally.”"
2021-01-11T12:29:21Z,business,Business,Dr Martens planning £3bn stock market debut in London,"The British footwear brand Dr Martens is planning a £3bn flotation, more than 60 years after its first pair of boots were stitched together in Northamptonshire. Best known for its 1460 boot featuring its trademark yellow stitching and chunky soles, the company expects to float at least 25% of the business on the London stock market. It comes nearly seven years after Dr Martens was bought for £300m by the private equity group Permira. Sales under its ownership have surged, rising from £160m in 2013 to £672m in the year to March 2020. Sources close to the plans said the shoe company expects to seek a valuation of about £3bn. The brand, which sells 11m pairs of shoes and boots a year across more than 60 countries, managed to grow throughout the pandemic, despite lockdowns that forced its 130 high street stores to close. Dr Martens reported an 18% rise in sales to £318m in the six months to September, while profits grew by a third to £86.3m. The majority of sales come from the wholesale business, which sells to third-party retailers. The first pair of Dr Martens made in the UK was in 1960 at its original factory in Northamptonshire, where one of its two main offices is still based. The boots grew in popularity over the following decades, first adopted by skinheads in the 1960s, and later becoming fashion staples among punks, goths and schoolgirls. However, Russ Mould, the investment director at broker AJ Bell, said there were some “red flags”, including consumer complaints over the quality of Dr Martens footwear. “Could it be that the business has suffered under private equity ownership? Many investors are sceptical about backing companies that are being sold by private equity, for fear they might have suffered from underinvestment and subjected to a ‘quantity over quality’ approach for production,” Mould said.
However, some critics have said the alleged deterioration came after it shifted the bulk of its production from the UK to Asia nearly 20 years ago, he said. Dr Martens said it rejected allegations of declining standards, and said Permira had continued to invest in the business since its takeover. The footwear firm also said on Monday it had diversified its supply chain, and reduced the proportion of shoes made in China from 46% to 32% between 2019 and 2020, but did not link the changes to quality concerns. Mould said Dr Martens’ IPO was coming at an interesting time for UK markets, hot on the heels of a Brexit deal and the best-ever start to a calendar year for the FTSE 100. “If ever there was a good time to market a well-known British name to investors, it is now,” he said."
2021-01-11T10:39:52Z,business,Business,"Bitcoin: be prepared to lose all your money, FCA warns consumers","Consumers should be prepared to lose all their money if they invest in schemes promising high returns from digital currencies such as bitcoin, a City watchdog has warned. The volatile nature of cryptoassets was highlighted again on Monday as bitcoin dropped 28% from Friday’s record high of $42,000, having doubled its value in less than a month. Despite the day’s decline to $30,200, bitcoin is still only at its lowest level since the first day of the new year. As the popularity of cryptocurrencies grows, the Financial Conduct Authority urged consumers to understand what they were investing in and the financial risks involved, given they were unlikely to be protected by UK schemes that help investors reclaim cash when companies go bust. The FCA said some crypto investment firms may be overstating potential payouts, or understating the risks. “The FCA is aware that some firms are offering investments in cryptoassets, or lending or investments linked to cryptoassets, that promise high returns,” the regulator said on Monday. “Investing in cryptoassets, or investments and lending linked to them, generally involves taking very high risks with investors’ money. If consumers invest in these types of product, they should be prepared to lose all their money,.” Investors who found themselves out of pocket would not be able to rely on the Financial Ombudsman Service to settle complaints or order compensation from offending firms. Consumers were also unlikely to be covered under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which covers losses up to £85,000 on fully regulated accounts and investment products including pensions.
The FCA said the complexity of some services and products linked to cryptoassets made it hard for consumers to understand the full risks. Therewas no guarantee that cryptoassets could be converted back into cash, putting consumers at the mercy of supply and demand in the market. They should also be aware that some firms that promise high returns may not face any regulation beyond basic money-laundering requirements. The FCA added that the “significant price volatility in cryptoassets, combined with the inherent difficulties of valuing cryptoassets reliably” put consumers at a high risk of losses.
Laith Khalaf, a financial analyst at broker AJ Bell, said: “The regulator is clearly concerned that the high risks already inherent in cryptoassets are being compounded by scam activity, as well as unregulated firms targeting consumers with marketing material that highlights the rewards, but not the potential downside, of investing in cryptoassets.” Bitcoin has become increasingly popular with mainstream institutional investors, including those who view it as a way to hedge against inflation. Some analysts have said media coverage of the cryptocurrency has also drawn in speculative buyers. However, some sceptics have warned that the cryptoboom could be heading for trouble, and that the currencies themselves have no intrinsic value. Myron Jobson, of online investment platform Interactive Investor, said bitcoin’s price surge has made Argo Blockchain – a publicly-traded blockchain technology company focused on large-scale cryptocurrency mining – the most-bought investments on its site since the new year. “The worry is that FOMO (fear of missing out) investors, won’t look before they leap and, encouraged by glossy marketing hooked on the meteoric rise of bitcoin, invest in cryptoassets which is a highly complex, high risk and relatively new area of investments,” Jobson explained. “The performance of bitcoin is hard to ignore, but we have seen all this before in 2017, and it’s come crashing down to earth. While it’s always tempting to follow the ‘this time it will be different’, the fact remains that the asset is notoriously volatile,” he added. Regardless of investors’ risk appetite, Jobson said cryptoassets should only be a “tiny proportion of a portfolio.” The FCA said investors should take precautions, by checking whether firms were on the Financial Services Register. If firms were not listed, consumers should ask whether companies were allowed to serve customers without gaining FCA permission, and consider withdrawing their cash."
2021-01-11T08:47:29Z,business,Business,Royal Mail appoints Simon Thompson as chief executive,"Royal Mail has appointed a former Ocado executive as its new boss, putting him in charge of a sweeping overhaul of the postal business. Simon Thompson, who was already a non-executive on the Royal Mail board and worked on the NHS test and trace programme, is stepping into the role immediately. The 54-year-old previously served as chief product officer at Ocado. He also held senior roles at Apple, HSBC, lastminute.com, Morrisons and Honda Europe. Royal Mail has been without a permanent chief executive since May 2020, when Rico Back unexpectedly resigned less than two years into the role. Back had been locked in a battle with unions over the company’s restructuring plan, and faced criticism for living in Switzerland during the Covid pandemic. He was replaced as an interim measure by the company’s chairman, Keith Williams. Thompson will be tasked with implementing a five-year turnaround plan launched by Back in 2019. The £1.8bn overhaul is intended to to revamp Royal Mail by shifting its focus from letters to parcels, amid a boom in online shopping, and follows years of declining profits. In June, the company unveiled a cost-cutting plan, which included the loss of 2,000 management jobs in areas including IT, finance, marketing and sales by March 2021. The company’s 90,000 postal workers would not be affected by the cuts, Royal Mail said at the time.
Thompson will receive a salary of £525,000, as well as a pension worth 13.6% of his base pay – about £71,400 a year. Further details about his pay package, including bonuses, will be disclosed in the firm’s annual report. Commenting on Thompson’s appointment, Williams said: “Royal Mail in the UK is in a period of significant transition and needs to move quickly, put the customer at the heart of everything we do, and adapt our business to better serve changing customer needs.” He added that Thompson “has a wealth of experience both in digital transformation and customer experience, and is ideally placed to lead the opportunity to grow and expand our UK parcels business and to meet our customers’ needs across both letters and parcels”."
2021-01-11T08:00:13Z,business,Business,The City of London is still eerily empty: will workers and shoppers ever return?,"The City of London has survived fire and plague in its centuries-long history. But the coronavirus pandemic has emptied its streets of office workers, shoppers and tourists, leading some to question whether the Square Mile will ever return to the way it was before Covid. The first working week of the new year has done little to break the silence in the capital’s financial district. Even if the vaccines programme allows restrictions to be lifted in the spring, few expect office staff to spend the entire working week at their desks in future. Hybrid working, where staff split their time between their office, home or another location, is expected to double following the pandemic, according to research from commercial property firm Cushman & Wakefield, and George Washington University in the US. Eight in 10 firms are expected to adopt this approach in future, up from three in 10 pre-Covid, while an “office-first” working culture will be promoted by just 10% of firms surveyed. However, company leaders agree that workplace culture, innovation and creativity inevitably take a hit when people work entirely remotely. This view was shared by colleagues Joe Trotti and Wayne Hawkins, partners at insurance brokers McGill and Partners, previously based at the firm’s office near Leadenhall market. When the Guardian visited the market before Christmas, Trotti and Hawkins had made a rare trip to London for a meeting. Neither was convinced that remote working is a long-term replacement for meeting up in real life. “With each other it’s not so bad,” said Hawkins, “but when you are trying to talk to clients you need that face-to-face contact.” “People miss the human side, you can’t get away from it. The business is going well, but people are keen to get together and reconnect,” said Trotti. Over half a million people usually work in the Square Mile financial district, yet only 9,000 people live in the area, meaning local businesses are reliant on passing trade from office workers. “What we see is a tale of two cities,” said Catherine McGuinness, policy chair at the City of London Corporation, the local authority for the district. “Many of the professional services firms pivoted well to working remotely, but these small supporting firms depend on footfall and until footfall comes back, they are really going to struggle”. By the time restrictions are expected to lift in the spring, those City service firms – from grab-and-go sandwich shops to barbers and dry cleaners – will have endured the best part of a year with temporary closures and little passing trade when allowed to be open. In normal times Kevin Goodman, acting manager at Blades barbers and hairdressers, would have expected to do up to 17 haircuts a day during a busy in the pre-Christmas rush. Instead, on a weekday in December, he had just one client booked in for the entire day.
For many companies, 2020 turned out to be a year of false dawns. In the summer, after the first lockdown restrictions were eased, the government urged businesses to return to their offices to help city centres recover. “In September, the City was starting to come back, you could see it improving, then Boris Johnson told everyone to work from home again,” said Goodman, “It is disheartening and soul-destroying.” He added “In the 2008 crash we saw a dip, and an increase in the time customers left between cuts, but now people have been told not to come to the City.” The pandemic emptied out city centres around the UK, and the world, yet few more than the financial heart of the capital, the City of London. The persistent lack of people in the district is illustrated by stark figures, collected from mobile location data from smartphones. Footfall at retail and leisure locations in the City of London was 83% lower in the middle of December, even before the region entered tier 4 restrictions, compared with levels measured pre-pandemic between 3 January and 6 February, according to Google Mobility Reports. Public transport use in the area was 71% below regular levels, and workplaces were 60% quieter.
The City witnessed the most significant drop in activity in recent months, more than was registered in the City of Westminster, home to the retail, leisure and cultural attractions of the West End, or the borough of Tower Hamlets, where the Canary Wharf financial district is located. January’s new England-wide lockdown closed the underwriting room at Lloyd’s, the world’s biggest insurance market, for the second time since the start of the pandemic, and only the second time in its history. It usually hosts 6,000 staff. The firm’s chairman, Bruce Carnegie-Brown, expects coronavirus to change traditional working practices for good. “We need to be quite adaptive, quite flexible and quite specific, job role by job role,” Carnegie-Brown said. “If you are a broker dealing with global clients and the remote working and the digital placement systems work, why do you need to be in the office physically unless there’s a specific negotiation?” Maurice Duckett, branch manager at suit and menswear retailer Roderick Charles, who has spent a quarter of a century in the Square Mile, fears the changes to the City may become permanent.
“It’s a very personal business, and it’s heartbreaking really,” Duckett said, speaking to the Guardian while the shop was still trading during December. He added that he has missed interaction with customers as much as their business during what he called “a nightmare nine months”. “I personally don’t think it will ever be the same. These companies have discovered that staff can work from home, why pay big rents if you can do without,” he said, adding that one of the firms based opposite the shop had emptied its office and moved out in December. Firms that are eyeing a permanent shift to flexible working, and whose property leases have allowed it, have seized the opportunity to shed space and cut costs. Advertising and marketing firm WPP said it had merged more than 100 offices during 2020 and was planning to cut its office space by 15%-20%. The pandemic also prompted a move for consultancy Cavendish Engineers after 16 years in two floors of an office building on the edge of the City. “We decided an office with huge overheads was no longer needed,” said Rachel Burrell, Cavendish’s director of business administration, adding that the firm’s engineers often visit clients’ sites, while her team of eight administrators was previously office-based.
The firm decided instead to purchase memberships at flexible workspace provider Fora for the eight staff who need a permanent desk, while day passes allowing access to the building will be added as required for other employees. London office vacancy rates are forecast to hit 10% in the first half of 2021, according to property consultancy Colliers International. It also anticipates average rents in the City will fall by almost 10% over the next year, from current levels of £58 per square foot. It isn’t just wealthy private landlords who will feel the loss of income from lower rents or empty properties. Many commercial buildings in city centres are owned by pension funds or insurance firms, which have long relied on them for a stable source of income – which then slowly trickles down to ordinary citizens. Businesses that promise increased flexibility following the crisis may also be responding to the demands of their staff. Almost half (45%) of City workers said that they want to continue working from home after the pandemic, as it has improved their work-life balance, according to a survey by accountancy consultancy Theta Global Advisors. More than half (57%) of London workers who responded said they did not want to return to full-time office working in future. For those workers who do want to return to their desks, for at least part of the week, the City had planned a celebration in the spring to welcome people – and their spending power – back to the area’s offices, bars, restaurants and shops.
That may be on hold now, but at the City of London Corporation there is confidence that the City will emerge from the pandemic shaken, but not shattered. “We are expecting this to be a catalyst for change, we are very confident about the City’s long-term prospects for the future. People are really keen to come back to have hubs, where people congregate, but they will be using their offices in different ways,” said Catherine McGuinness at the corporation. Whenever in 2021 employees do return to their corporate headquarters, in all likelihood more than a year after they left, they may have to contend with more than they bargained for: rodents. Sightings of rats by pest controllers soared by 78% in October, while those of mice increased by 63%, according to the British Pest Control Association. In the absence of humans, rodents may have learned to make some offices their home, and will still be there when the humans return."
2021-01-11T06:01:11Z,business,Business,Online shopping spree boosts Christmas income at Post Office,"A surge in online shopping helped to push up the Post Office’s income over Christmas, as web-based retailers escaped the Covid-19 restrictions that bedevilled the high street. In the four weeks to 27 December, the Post Office recorded 51.3m customer transactions, just 0.5% below the same period of 2019, with sales up 17% to £66.3m. Mail and parcel services increased “significantly”, boosted by the soaring growth of Drop & Go, the Post Office’s fast-track service for businesses and online sellers, which boosted sales by 87%. Cash and banking services declined only slightly, down 10%, despite the restrictions affecting thousands of small businesses that bank at one of the Post Office’s 11,500 branches, the largest retail network in the UK. The biggest negative impact of Covid restrictions was on travel money transactions, where like-for-like sales dropped by 69%, as holidays were rendered near-impossible for most of the period. The Post Office’s chief executive, Nick Read, hailed the contribution of postmasters, the people who run individual branches. The company was forced to apologise last year after a landmark legal case ruled it had wrongly accused dozens of postmasters of criminal activity, resulting in multiple convictions. “After a very challenging year for much of the retail sector, I am pleased to see 17% growth in network income over the Christmas period thanks to the hard work of postmasters,” said Read.
“Our physical presence has been vital across the UK, with customers enjoying the convenience, expert advice and safe hands that our postmasters offer, in addition to the invaluable support they have provided to local communities during the pandemic, with 99% of the network remaining open.” Variable income for postmasters rose 20% during the year. Despite milder-than-usual weather over the four weeks to 27 December, income from bill payment was up after the Post Office won a contract with British Gas to process top-ups."
2021-01-11T00:01:04Z,business,Business,UK firms fear twin force of Covid plus Brexit will force them under,"Small businesses and manufacturers are bracing themselves for a fight for survival this year, according to fresh survey data, as they negotiate the twin threats of Covid-19 and weaker post-Brexit trade with the EU. More than 250,000 small firms expect to fold without further government financial support, according to a quarterly poll by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). Manufacturers’ trade body Make UK said its members expected lower investment in the UK and to have a harder time recruiting talent. Just under 5% of the 1,400 companies surveyed by the FSB said they were expecting to close down this year, the largest proportion in the history of the trade body’s Small Business Index, established in the wake of the 2008 banking crash. If the same degree of pessimism applies across the UK’s 5.9m small businesses, that would suggest as many as 295,000 fear they will go under. The vast majority of firms surveyed, 80%, did not expect their prospects to improve over the next three months, with tough lockdown restrictions likely to stay in place. Close to a quarter had cut staff over the last three months, while one in seven expected to do so between now and the end of March, raising a question mark over the futures of 16.8 million people who work for small businesses. The FSB’s national chair, Mike Cherry, said the amount of government support available had dwindled as the pandemic raged on. “At the outset of the first national lockdown, the UK government was bold,” he said. “The support mechanisms put in place weren’t perfect, but they were an exceptionally good starting point. That’s why it’s so disappointing that it’s met this lockdown with a whimper.” He welcomed support for retail, leisure and hospitality businesses but said that many were “still being left out in the cold”, including company directors, the newly self-employed, supply chains and firms without commercial premises. The FSB published a five-point plan to assist small businesses, including grants, income support and extended debt relief. But it warned that firms already lacked the cash to cope with the tough trading environment, particularly given the costs associated with adjusting to the UK’s new trading relationship with the EU. Almost half of the FSB’s members expect international sales to fall, up from 33% last year. And survey data from Make UK, in partnership with accounting firm PwC, indicates that its members feel the same way about the post-Brexit challenge. A third of companies said they expected investment prospects for UK businesses to decrease following the departure from the EU, with just 18% of companies believing they will improve. Just over a quarter believed exports to the EU would fall with just 16% believing they would increase, while a third believed the UK’s ability to attract international talent would fall. Customs delays, cited by 47% of firms, are seen as the biggest risk to companies while concerns over national and local lockdowns were the second biggest risk at 46%.
Make UK’s chief executive, Stephen Phipson, said: “The transition to new trading arrangements with the EU was always going to be the biggest challenge facing manufacturers this year and the fact we have an agreement in place doesn’t alter that.” He called for a bold industrial strategy that goes beyond “short-term tinkering”, instead laying out a plan for the next decade. As firms voiced their concern about the future, an index tracking business output fell to its lowest ever level, below even the post-banking crash recession. The BDO Output Index, which measures economic data from the UK’s main business surveys, averaged 73.62 in 2020, well below the previous low of 83.28, recorded in 2009. “These figures reinforce just how stark the economic impact of the pandemic has been,” said BDO partner Kaley Crossthwaite. “As we enter a third national lockdown, crippling challenges will continue to plague businesses in the weeks and months ahead. “Successful and rapid rollout of Covid-19 vaccines will be the single biggest driver of business recovery.”"
2021-01-10T17:50:22Z,business,Business,Green economy plans fuel new metals and energy 'supercycle',"The global economy could be on the brink of a new commodity “supercycle” as governments prepare to use a green industrial revolution to kickstart growth following the coronavirus pandemic. The price of commodities, such as energy and metals, have reached record highs in recent weeks despite the ongoing spread of Covid-19 and are expected to climb further as countries embark on plans for a green economic recovery. Market experts, including US bank Goldman Sachs, believe the boom could echo the last “supercycle” in the early 2000s led by the sharp growth of emerging BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia, India and China). “Covid is already ushering in a new era of policies aimed at social need instead of financial stability,” the US bank said. “This will likely create cyclically stronger, more commodity-intensive economic growth.” Chris Midgeley, the head of analytics at S&P Global Platts, said “an unusual confluence” of global events had ignited a surge in commodity markets in recent months, but the trend was largely driven by growth in China. Iron ore prices climbed to $176.90 a tonne shortly before Christmas, the highest since May 2011, and the market price for copper topped $8,000 a tonne for the first time in more than seven years. Global oil prices have climbed to 11-month highs of $55 a barrel with help from the Opec oil cartel. “Construction sites are some of the few areas of the economy that have remained open, and in places like China the government has been trying to stimulate that part of the economy,” Midgeley said. The fiscal stimulus plans outlined by countries – including the UK and the incoming Biden administration in the US – are likely to increase demand for metals and energy to build green infrastructure.
“Things like copper, nickel and cobalt are all likely to see a boost from the extra demand to build infrastructure. Even steel and petrochemicals will be needed,” said Midgeley. A weaker US dollar, the currency used to trade most commodities, could allow prices to climb higher as demand grows. Mark Lewis, chief sustainability strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said: “I’ve been in financial markets for 30 years now and I have never seen anything like it. It feels like any market you look at, investors want to buy.” The next three decades are “likely to bring a supercycle in investments in clean energy infrastructure, clean transportation and everything else that is required to make the green transition possible”, he said.
Higher fossil fuel prices could increase the appetite for low-cost renewable energy, which will be even cheaper by comparison as those prices rise, Lewis added. Low-carbon energy will be even more economically attractive to major energy users in Europe thanks to record high prices for carbon permits on the EU’s emissions trading scheme, which reached €34.25 (£30.90) a tonne of CO2 for the first time last week. However, higher fossil fuel prices could also tempt major oil and gas companies to invest in lucrative new projects by inflating the profits of existing portfolios in “one last party” for fossil fuels, he warned. “This is the dilemma for these companies,” said Lewis. “Any company will be interested in maximising returns from their existing [fossil fuel] portfolio. But we will be watching very closely for whether they start investing in major new projects. It will be a very interesting test of their commitment.” • This article was amended on 11 January 2021 because an earlier version incorrectly stated that Mark Lewis was BNP Paribas’ global head of sustainability research.

2021-01-10T17:34:33Z,business,Business,"Better leisure centres being bailed out across UK, says GLL chief","The operator of the Olympic aquatic centre and hundreds of other leisure centres across the UK is being bailed out by cash-strapped local authorities in every area it operates as it struggles with the latest lockdown, the Guardian can reveal. GLL, which trades under the name Better, runs 230 pools, gyms and sports halls in areas including Belfast, Manchester, Newcastle, Cardiff, Bath, Cumbria and Cornwall and several London boroughs. Its chief executive, Mark Sesnan, warns that the lockdown has come at the worst time possible for a business built on new year’s fitness resolutions. He also fears the government help will not be enough to stop pools and sport centres closing for good. Various local bailouts have been secured in more than 40 of these areas, involving either direct grants, or deferred payments or loans, he said. And negotiations are still underway in the remaining areas, including Croydon council, which declared itself effectively bankrupt last month. Despite these bailouts and the importance of personal fitness highlighted by the pandemic, the business faces “disaster” because the third lockdown was imposed at its most lucrative time of year. It has been forced to close all of its leisure services including outdoor pools despite evidence to suggest swimming in chlorinated pools is safe from Covid infection. GLL was formed in 1993 to run Greenwich council’s leisure service and has since grown to become the biggest social enterprise leisure provider in the country.
But it has revealed that the pandemic has cost it £170m in lost revenue, forcing it to spend £20m in reserves. It has also had to take out a £20m loan, cut more than 500 jobs with more under threat, and become dependent on local bailouts and the government’s furlough scheme. Its predicament has led to questions about its business model and calls for the services it runs to be brought back under council control in some areas including Belfast and Swindon. Chief executive, Mark Sesnan, has defended the company’s record and insists it does have a bright future once the latest lockdown is eased. He said: “We’ve moved from being a relatively strong financial business to one that now does rely on support for local authorities. The biggest issue is that some councils are very cash strapped themselves and have more pressing priorities.” He admitted that its business planning is predicated on the furlough scheme, which has helped 10,500 GLL employees, continuing at least until Easter. The government’s promise of £9,000 for each leisure centre won’t be enough, he warned. He pointed out its largest generate £1,000-a-day income, but are currently bringing in nothing. He said: “GLL welcomes and needs any and all financial support, but to be meaningful the amount needs to be based on real business losses, not arbitrary handouts.” Unite the union which represents many of GLL’s staff, says the pandemic has “exposed” GLL’s over reliance on public money and staff on casual contracts. Regional officer, Onay Kasab, said: “The pandemic has exposed GLL in several ways. Their business model relies on local government funding and with austerity it is not a model that can continue. It is not cheaper to outsource, because it ends up costing more money in the long term. The company is clearly in danger of going down, yet council taxpayers money continues to be thrown at it.” Sesnan, a former union shop steward, admitted that more than half the staff are on “flexible” contracts. But he insisted the company is trying to help as many staff as possible. He admitted that GLL’s 50 most inefficient pools and gyms could be forced to close, but these do not include the former Olympic facilities in east London. The most vulnerable pools and sports centres are the ones that did not open after relaxations of lockdown rules, including some in Cornwall, Cumbria, Newcastle, Preston, and a number of London boroughs. The government has insisted its leisure rescue package will not pay for services that remained closed. Sesnan said: “Swimming pools are not easy buildings to hibernate, you can’t just lock the doors and walk away.” And even with paying customers, some subsidy is required. He said. “A swim costs £10 to put on, but nobody pays any more than £5 for it. So whichever way you stack it up someone has to pay for that other fiver.” But despite the difficulties he insists the organisation can survive. “GLL isn’t going down. People who have kept themselves fit have had a much better chance of surviving the virus, than people who haven’t. It’s a low-cost way of preventing things like this in the future. There needs to be a new partnership between the health and fitness going forward. So the future is good.”"
2021-01-10T15:37:03Z,business,Business,UK supermarket staff say they have become the 'forgotten key workers',"When the UK first went into lockdown last March, many supermarket workers said they had never felt so appreciated. Customers would thank them for their service, leave chocolates for the staff room and applaud delivery vans as if they were carrying royalty rather than groceries. Not any more, according to numerous store employees who contacted the Guardian to express their fears and frustrations about working through the second wave. From debit card refuseniks pulling down their masks to lick their fingers and separate their twenties, to families treating a trip to the supermarket as a social outing, many felt they were now the “forgotten key workers”. Others feel taken for granted, suffering anxiety and panic attacks as a result of their work environment. “In lockdown one it felt a little embarrassing at times – people would wave, even stop and applaud as you went past as if you were a NHS worker. Now, it’s back to normal. Block a cul-de-sac for five minutes and you can expect abuse,” said Ben Harvey, who started delivering groceries for a supermarket in April after losing his job as a sales executive. “You want to tell them that you’re delivering essential supplies during a global pandemic and they shouldn’t even be out, but in your employer’s van and uniform you obviously just have to bite your tongue and suck it up.” Conspiracy theorists are making the job harder, said one worker from a small supermarket in the home counties. “The maskless hordes and the QAnon conspiracy spouters seem to grow by the day. Many don’t care, some are just ignorant; but the most dangerous are those that think they’re following the rules. Customers who keep their distance from others, but crawl over shop staff to get their ‘essential’ Red Bull and loo roll, thanking them for everything they are doing from a mask pulled down to their chin to ‘help’ convey their message with sincerity and microdroplets of Covid-19.”
The media seemed to have forgotten supermarket workers, he said: “Doctors and nurses are continually featured in the news (and rightly so), but there is very little mentioned about those who have worked throughout the pandemic and the toll this year has taken on them. “My mental health has been battered beyond belief and no matter what my behemoth employer says – there has been no consideration shown to the wellbeing and mental health of their staff. It has gone unchecked and unconsidered while we ring endless products through the non-socially distanced checkouts and stuff dirty cash into the ever expanding pockets of the shareholders and directors.” Social distancing had gone out of the window, he complained: “My little village shop is tiny, it has three aisles and (literally) no room to swing a cat on the shop floor. The company have told us that the customer limit is 22 people. I cannot express how crazy the notion of cramming 22 customers, plus five or so staff, into the shop is. [My employer] decided towards the end of the first lockdown to remove the one-way system in its stores. We appealed against that decision, and still do, but are told that ‘people weren’t following it’.” One home shopper working in Sussex said there had been an increase in people treating a trip to the supermarket as a day out or an excuse to socialise. “There are just far too many people who come in and wander around the shop because they don’t have anything else to do”, or whole families of six or more people,” she said. As a home shopper, she spends long shifts packing six bags at a time for online customers. “It may sound a bit dramatic, but we feel like we are literally putting our lives on the line, like any frontline worker, so that people can eat. If delivery and home shopping didn’t exist, people would have to go out.”
A till worker in a supermarket in Scotland said mask etiquette was poor. “People get to my till, puffing away and moaning about ‘not being able to breathe’ even though they haven’t turned blue yet and are speaking clearly to me. They believe so much that they can’t breathe they pull the mask away from their mouths and down to their chin as if being at the till suddenly makes it safe to do this and Covid only goes as far as the till belt. Oh and let’s not forget the amount of old people and middle aged people who all pull their masks down, lick their fingers to give me cash because the ‘notes all stick together’.” The manager of one store in south-east England said several members of their team were suffering from anxiety and panic attacks as a result of customer behaviour. Mental health problems were being exacerbated by staff shortages, she said. “Most staff members are exhausted because colleagues are shielding/self isolating and so everyone else takes the strain because there is still a lot of work to do. On New Year’s Eve I overheard lots of customers talking about the secret party/gatherings they were having and laughing about breaking the rules. It’s really hard to hear stuff like that, especially when they are not just putting their friends lives at risk, but ours too. It makes you feel so angry, actually and I often want to say something to them.” There was a bigger sense of comradeship before, she said. “People were doing their neighbours shopping and learning how to bake and cook etc. We were the only people that customers were seeing and we got to know them better. People would send us letters of thanks and care packages etc as key workers and we felt valued. All of the goodwill towards key workers seems to have vanished now. We feel exhausted, stressed and abused most of the time. It’s really hard to switch off too. But still we go back each day and keep filling the shelves to feed the nation.”"
2021-01-10T12:12:27Z,business,Business,Are soaring markets and house prices an 'epic bubble' about to pop? | Larry Elliott,"There was plenty of bad news in America last week. A mob of Donald Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building. The number of new Covid-19 infections hit a record high. Employment fell by 140,000. None of it fazed Wall Street which continued to climb to dizzying new heights. That’s the way with financial markets. When they are in that sort of mood they go up when the news is good and they go up when the news is bad. Last week’s disappointing jobs report was a case in point. The fact that businesses had been shedding labour meant Joe Biden would have even more of an incentive to deliver an expansionary tax and spending package soon after he becomes president on 20 January. The loss of jobs, in the eyes of Wall Street, was not a bad thing at all. Rather it was a reason to continue buying into a stock market that is higher than it was before the pandemic began.
Despite a strong performance last week, shares in London still have some way to go before they reach their pre-crisis level. Here, the asset class that has defied the depressed state of the economy and the health emergency is residential property. According to the latest data from the Halifax, the cost of the average house rose by 6% in 2020, an annual rate of increase normally associated with a fast-growing economy, not one that has just seen its biggest decline since The Great Frost of 1709. There are some specific reasons why house prices are going up. Rishi Sunak’s temporary stamp duty holiday is one. The desire for houses with a bit more space and a garden is another. The fact that many people can afford to buy a more expensive home because they have saved money while working from home is a third. But what links rising share prices in the US and rising house prices in the UK is money creation by central banks. Both the Federal Reserve in Washington and the Bank of England have ramped up their quantitative easing (QE) programmes, under which the central banks buy financial assets, usually government bonds, in exchange for cash. In theory, the newly created money could fund new productive investment for companies eager to expand, but in reality much of it has been lent for speculative activity of one form or another. There is no real mystery about this. It happened after the financial crisis of 2008 and it is happening again. The major central banks say they had no choice because the alternative would have been a financial meltdown that would have made last year’s economic collapse even worse than it was. Their critics say QE as currently designed widens the gap between rich and poor, fails to put money into the bits of the economy that really need it and has led to the creation of colossal bubbles that are bound to burst.
Those who remain bullish about share prices say fears of a crash are misplaced. The global economy is going to recover quickly as soon as mass vaccination programmes get on top of the pandemic. Yet even strong growth will not force central banks and finance ministries to withdraw the extraordinary amount of stimulus they have been providing because inflation will remain low. These two factors, a period of rapid catch-up and a benign policy stance, will boost corporate profits and so justify rising stock market valuations. Not everybody is convinced. The veteran British financier Jeremy Grantham, who co-founded the US investment firm GMO, fired off a warning to the company’s clients last week. He did not pull his punches. “The long, long bull market since 2009 has finally matured into a fully-fledged epic bubble,” he said. “Featuring extreme overvaluation, explosive price increases, frenzied issuance, and hysterically speculative investor behaviour, I believe this event will be recorded as one of the great bubbles of financial history, right along with the South Sea bubble, 1929 and 2000.” For Grantham, Tesla is the stock that proves the market has taken leave of its senses. The current market capitalisation of $600bn amounts to $1.25m for each electric car sold, compared with $9,000 a car for General Motors. “What has 1929 got to equal that?” he asks.
The assumption on Wall Street is that the Fed will always stand behind the market. If prices fall precipitously investors can sleep easy knowing that its chair, Jerome Powell, and his colleagues will do what’s necessary to limit losses and get the market rising again. Grantham says this is wrong. He believes “this bubble will burst in due time, no matter how hard the Fed tries to support it, with consequent damaging effects on the economy and on portfolios.” It’s not all that hard to see the circumstances in which Grantham could be proved right. There is a logical inconsistency in Wall Street’s belief that it will be business as usual for the US once enough Americans have had their Covid jabs and its conviction that monetary policy will remain as loose as it currently is. Fresh dollops of stimulus might not actually be needed at a time when demand is going to be picking up anyway. Inflationary pressure is currently weak but were that to change, the mood in the markets could also change quickly. The yield, or interest rate, on government bonds would start to rise and share prices would fall. Wall Street would be begging the Fed to come to its rescue, but with inflation rising it might feel uneasy about doing so. Will this happen? Who knows? But the financial markets are placing a lot of trust in the Fed and the other central banks. It had better not be misplaced."
2021-01-10T12:00:49Z,business,Business,Outdoor dining has been a Covid bright spot. Let's make it permanent | Gene Marks,"Among all the small businesses in this country that have suffered this past year, it’s little debate that those who own independent restaurants have suffered the most. Thanks to the pandemic, local officials have placed draconian restrictions on their operations. It’s making it extremely difficult for these restaurateurs to survive.
But for those who have managed to survive, there’s been a significant bright spot: outdoor dining. Just about every city has allowed restaurants to create seating on the sidewalks and streets in front of their establishments, with some cities and organizations even providing funding to help them with the transition. Many restaurants have jumped at the opportunity and spent thousands of dollars erecting makeshift eateries, yurts and pods, complete with ductwork, electrical wiring, space heaters, private TV sets, sliding doors and comfy furniture, all to navigate around their cities’ restrictions. And although some set-ups don’t appear to be any safer than an indoor dining room, their cities have let them. And their customers seem to love it. So the big question, now that we can see an end to Covid with vaccinations, is whether those same cities will allow them to continue forever. Will outdoor dining be here to stay? It is in New York. New York City was one of the first in the country to make outdoor dining permanent this past fall. “It was a big, bold experiment in supporting a vital industry and reimagining our public space – and it worked,” the city’s mayor told the New York Times. “As we begin a long-term recovery, we’re proud to extend and expand this effort to keep New York City the most vibrant city in the world. It’s time for a new tradition.” Of course, outdoor dining isn’t new. But the trend is just one of those existing things - like work from home, e-commerce and virtual meetings – that was accelerated because of the pandemic, and it will surely provide a new channel of income for restaurateurs once the pandemic is behind us and the economy recovers. It’s also an opportunity for many cities to reinvent themselves. “From Tampa to Tulsa, Seattle to Syracuse and Brooklyn to Burlington, cities are embracing parklets like never before,” writes Andrew Hirschfeld in OZY. “Urban designers, city planners and architecture firms alike are scrambling to come up with innovative designs for parklets, prompting competitions like the Design for Distancing planning initiative in Baltimore, Maryland, focused on outdoor spaces.” There’s certainly some pushback. While many are sympathetic to the plight of small restaurants, city residents have been patiently turning a blind eye to the loss of parking, loading zones and the intrusion of their walkways while busy restaurant employees run back and forth with plates of food. Street closures will create traffic problems once traffic returns. People with disabilities are already complaining about added hazards. Some will want things to get back to how they were before the virus. But those concerns don’t seem to be stopping a movement in many areas of the country towards making permanent what was originally thought to be a temporary arrangement. Dallas city council is considering a plan to allow many restaurants who have moved their operations to the streets to stay there. Los Angeles and Boston’s leaders are also discussing similar plans. Cincinnati’s leaders have approved a plan to convert a temporary outdoor dining program into a permanent feature. Writers and restaurant industry experts are voicing support for other cities to do the same. I’m one of them. Outdoor dining should be made permanent. City residents like me will adapt and be better off for it. As for restaurant owners, permanent outdoor dining would be a new channel of revenue that, if made permanent in 2021, could make up for some of the losses they’ve incurred in 2020. And it will also provide opportunities for architects, construction contractors, engineers, supply manufacturers and other small businesses who will seek to serve these needs. And guess what? We have Covid to thank for it."
2021-01-10T07:00:44Z,business,Business,"We may have avoided no-deal, but this is still Brexit tier 3","Donald Trump’s starring role in the storming of the Capitol on Wednesday marked a fitting end to the courtship of the US president by Boris Johnson. Just think: before the president lost convincingly to Joe Biden, our prime minister – a master of procrastination and prevarication – was holding out for a Trump victory and a world-beating UK-US trade deal, which might well have involved a no-deal Brexit. Johnson enthusiasts tell us what a brilliant tactic it was for the prime minister to take the negotiations with the EU to 11th hour, but the likelihood is that a deal of some sort was only decided on when the US option disappeared. As it is, the deal is most certainly thin, as described by Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer: it does not cover the 80% of our economy accounted for by services, and involves massive increases in bureaucratic form-filling for businesses from manufacturers to road hauliers and wine merchants, not to mention British citizens in general. It particularly hurts the young, who are overwhelmingly against Brexit. Before going on, I should like to wish readers, including green-ink Brexiters, a Happy New Lockdown. Life must go on, which is why not just this government, but governments around the world, have imposed lockdowns of one sort or another. But in this country, we are close to being world leaders in the degree to which the economy and people are suffering. In which context, the mantra seems to be “lock down because the NHS can’t cope”. One cannot help concluding that our pathetic performance vis-a-vis, say, Germany, is not unconnected with a decade of austerity. The health service was ill-prepared for Covid: the government should have learned years ago that every winter there are pressures on hospital capacity, and that it is a false economy not to allow enough spare capacity in hospitals.
But back to Brexit, which, so far from being “done”, has only just begun – begun, that is, to cause chaos and disappointment throughout the land, not least to those “red wall” voters with whom Starmer seems obsessed. I know being leader of a Labour opposition is one of the most difficult jobs in politics, but I think he is paying too much attention to the minority of Labour Brexit voters. He should be proud of his record as a Remainer, and be hammering these Brexiter charlatans in the cabinet continually. I can hardly wait for most of this generation of so-called Conservative politicians to be swept away by an electorate that has finally absorbed what has been done in their name. Johnson recently claimed that leaving the EU was not a “rupture” from “our friends” on the continent (oddly enough, we are still in Europe). This is a man who had an expensive education. Brexit constitutes a huge rupture with continental Europe, and our friends know it. Hence, notwithstanding the way we tried their patience to the limit, President Macron referred to the way the British had been treated to “lies and false promises”; Michel Barnier said “a divorce is nothing to celebrate”; and the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, came close to saying “please come back one day”. The extreme rightwing Eurosceptic “bastards” – Sir John Major’s description – who hijacked what was once the genuine Conservative and Unionist party affect to be the disciples of Margaret Thatcher, and often cite her celebrated Bruges speech of 1988. What they fail to quote is what she said about the single market, which she and my old friend Lord Cockfield did so much to create. What she said was that the moving force behind the creation of the single market was “the aim of a Europe open to enterprise”. “By getting rid of barriers,” she said, “by making it possible for companies to operate on a European scale, we can best compete with the US, Japan and other new economic powers.” And she meant it: her papers in the Churchill archives at Cambridge bring out her enthusiasm for the project. Single market? Those crazed Brexit cabinet ministers had to have the single market explained to them by our former ambassador to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers, when they met after the referendum result. They didn’t even know the difference between the customs union, with its zero tariffs for intra-EU trade, and the single market, which gradually eliminated non-tariff barriers. So how thin is this “deal”? It has been compared by a great expert on European affairs, Brendan Donnelly of the Federal Trust, to the Cheshire cat: as you examine it, the details disappear and only the grin remains. No-deal would have involved the imposition of crippling tariffs on major exporters such as the motor industry and further erosion of our depleted industrial base. For which relief, much thanks. But the act of leaving the single market reimposes the non-tariff barriers removed for frictionless trade. Johnson’s “deal” takes us from Brexit tier 4 to Brexit tier 3. It avoids a catastrophe but is still a disaster."
2021-01-10T07:00:44Z,business,Business,There will be no spring recovery. Sunak must prepare for a double-dip recession,"With the development of the coronavirus vaccine, there had been light emerging at the end of the tunnel after a long and difficult year. After the worst year for growth since the Great Frost of 1709, the post-Covid thaw this spring seemed as if it was set to launch the UK economy into a roaring 2020s. Now, clear signs are emerging that Britain’s economy will be hit hard by tougher restrictions needed to contain the surge in Covid-19 infections, fuelled by a new faster-spreading variant first identified late last year in southern England. Far from a boom in 2021, the economy is destined for a double-dip recession. The new restrictions to contain the spread of the disease, including stay-at-home orders and the closure of schools under lockdown 3.0 in England, will heap renewed pressure on already struggling companies. Faced with the extra restrictions, and rapid growth in coronavirus infections – which would have led people to voluntarily put their normal activities on hold in any event, exposing the false choice between lockdowns and allowing the economy to run free – the consultancy Oxford Economics expects gross domestic product (GDP) to fall by 4% in the first three months of 2021. This would follow an anticipated contraction in the final quarter of 2020. The news comes after the UK had recorded a faster than expected recovery from the spring lockdown, spurred by the release of pent-up demand and the government’s “eat out to help out” scheme getting diners back into the embattled hospitality sector. That now feels like a long time ago, a remnant of a false dawn for the economy, as the UK fulfils the worst fears of critics who warned it was irresponsible to race back to normality. In comparison with the spring 2020 lockdown, the restrictions at the start of this year will not be quite such a huge wrecking ball. As the whole of the UK ground to a halt in the first wave of infections, GDP collapsed by 20%, an unprecedented sudden stop. This time around, businesses and households are arguably in a better position. Although they are now suffering from the cumulative strain of dealing with almost a year of Covid’s economic consequences, a playbook for how to work through a lockdown – for those that are able to continue trading – now exists, while economic support schemes from the government are already up and running. However, the two big questions are whether enough money is available for those falling victim to the pandemic’s economic ravages through no fault of their own, and if the safety net launched last spring is adequate to carry the country through the latest chapter in the Covid nightmare. In this regard, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has deployed an additional £4.6bn of funding for business grants, on top of the £280bn in emergency spending for the public sector, businesses, workers and households throughout the crisis so far. But there were huge gaps in the system even before a double-dip recession was looming for struggling families and companies. With a 4% contraction expected in the first three months of the year – the sharpest plunge in history, save for last spring, and an even bigger economic collapse than the winter of discontent in 1978-79 – more must be done. Gaps in the support system include the looming end of the £20-a-week uplift in universal credit benefits, as unemployment rapidly escalates towards 2.6 million, which will threaten poverty for thousands. For companies, there are calls for an extension to business rates holidays and VAT reductions, as well as a commitment to keep the furlough scheme open longer than April, when it is planned to close, due to the time it will take to recover from a double-dip collapse. Sunak intends to announce fresh measures to support Britain’s economy on 3 March when he holds the government’s next budget. With the onset of a double-dip, he will need to act much sooner to carry Britain through. Saudis give oil price a shot in the arm Major western economies may be returning to 2020 lockdown measures, but the global oil market is climbing to highs not seen since before coronavirus restrictions swept Europe. The international benchmark price for oil, Brent crude, reached the $55-a-barrel mark for the first time since last February within the first week of the year. Oil market bulls may hope that prices inch higher as each new country begins administering vaccines. But the real shot in the arm of global oil markets has less to do with Covid-19 jabs than the careful market choreography of the world’s largest oil-producing nations. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) has spent the better part of a year mirroring the artificial collapse in oil demand with a similarly unprecedented drop in oil production. But now, oil exporters are considering their next moves as they anticipate the gradual return of the world’s appetite for energy. Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of Opec, surprised the world last week. While many petro-nations have been itching to pump more barrels of oil into the global market again, Saudi Arabia will unilaterally cut production by 1m barrels a day to keep prices afloat through the first months of the year. The move has driven oil prices to 11-month highs. It has also helped paper over the cracks that have begun to emerge within the alliance between those energy ministers who favour a softly-softly return to higher oil output and those eager to line their countries’ hard-hit coffers with fresh oil revenues. It may be enough to make oil market bulls forget that, for all the good news from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, it is still a long road ahead for Covid vaccinations and a return to economic normality. British bookies are becoming a jackpot bet for Vegas’s big casinos Could Entain – the gambling firm that owns Ladbrokes and Coral – follow William Hill into the arms of a US suitor? Las Vegas casino operator Caesars paid nearly £3bn for William Hill last year. Now Entain has knocked back an £8.1bn proposal from MGM Resorts, also based in Sin City. In a statement released on Friday, MGM underlined its intentions by revealing that shareholder Barry Diller, the media tycoon, had pledged $1bn to increase the percentage of the offer made up of cash. This doesn’t change all that much. Under the City’s takeover code, MGM has until 1 February to make a firm bid and it will probably have to do a bit better than £8bn. But it’s clear that MGM isn’t just speculatively kicking the tyres: it has come to play. Why are these Las Vegas high-rollers so keen on British bookies? The answer is that the likes of William Hill and Entain have something that the casinos of the strip do not: an online sports book already battle-hardened from years of competing in a mature market. The US supreme court only legalised sports betting in 2018, and many states are still drawing up regulations. Early signs indicate that the opportunities are huge, with California alone likely to be a bigger market than the UK. American casinos don’t have the luxury of time to build the technology and the expertise they need to establish a leading position. So far they’ve been willing to rent it via joint ventures with their Limey cousins. Now, like every good Las Vegas casino owner, they want it all. MGM will argue that Entain won’t get a better offer, pointing to the fact that the two firms already operate a joint venture that would be hard for a rival bid to unpick. Entain will insist a better deal might be out there and that, anyway, it has enough growth potential outside the US to go it alone. But MGM surely has plenty of ammunition left. Much now depends on how far the company and deep-pocketed backers such as Diller are willing to raise the stakes. Aviation is the latest sector to endure a belated Covid U-turn Finally, the government has announced that all inbound travellers to Britain will need to be tested for Covid-19; a move that has not yet quite closed the stable door after the horse has bolted, but merely signalled its planned closure sometime this week – some 10 months after the first widespread calls for border checks. On public health grounds, few would disagree with the need for tests – including most of the aviation industry. Business strife obviously pales beside the immediate public health emergency. Among those who have ventured abroad in recent months, there has often been incredulity at the absence of checks at the UK border, compared with the measures taken by other countries – let alone those island nations that have almost eradicated the virus, rather than propagating new variants. But for some of the UK airlines and airports brought to their knees – once genuinely world-leading, rather than merely posturing as such – there will be immense frustration that their own calls for harmonised pre-departure testing, with global standards, appear to have fallen on deaf ears for so long. What has now been brought in as an emergency measure would have been better applied earlier with care and coordination. A coordinated international approach may not be in the gift of the UK government, even one minded to do so – but as statements from Heathrow to inbound tourism organisations make clear, there is precious little trust that ministers have paid attention to the experience and concerns of those at the sharp end. In the context of U-turns and failures in the pandemic, aviation can console itself that it is not alone. Frustrating, belated and imperfect though the current policy now is, it is essentially correct and will give more certainty than than the pantomime of in-out travel corridors. Unfortunately for aviation, the only conclusion for many airlines will be to ground their fleets again."
2021-01-10T00:05:35Z,business,Business,A flurry of results is about to reveal what retailers really got for Christmas,"Coronavirus was without doubt the Grinch that stole Christmas, and this week will bring an avalanche of trading figures revealing how well the UK’s retailers navigated what the chief executive of Marks & Spencer calls “near-impossible trading conditions”. The scene was set last week by updates from supermarkets Morrisons and Sainsbury’s, which, like other “essential” retailers, have prospered in locked-down Britain. For poor old non-essential retailers such as M&S, where clothing sales dropped by a quarter, the numbers in its Christmas trading statement showed that without your stores open you needed a damn good website – such as Next’s, which helped the company almost match its 2019 sales. The eclectic trio of Games Workshop, JD Sports and the Hut Group resume the trading-update action on Tuesday, with all three likely to tell a positive story for the important festive period. While JD’s sales will have been dented by store closures, it has been trading well online and has profited from runaway demand for casual clothing and trainers. Games Workshop and the Hut, which is behind websites such as Lookfantastic, have benefited from people pursuing their hobbies while stuck at home, whether that is painting orcs or fingernails. The Hut is on a roll: its shares have raced ahead since its flotation in September. Games Workshop, best known for its tabletop-game franchise Warhammer, has been around longer and is expected to report profits of no less than £90m, up from last year’s £59m, according to the Share Centre. Tesco, which leads a pack of at least six retailers, including Primark, reporting on Thursday, is another likely winner. Sainsbury’s – which wowed the City with a £60m profit boost – and Morrisons have already delivered better-than-expected numbers. The expansion of Tesco’s home delivery service will have helped its performance. However, the latest figures from analysts at Kantar show the UK’s biggest retailer losing market share, with no-frills chains Lidl and Iceland among the standout performers in the annual battle to sell turkeys and brussels sprouts. The news from Primark is likely to be less positive. The cut-price fashion chain’s owner, Associated British Foods, warned on New Year’s Eve that Primark would miss out on an additional £220m in sales, as its stores had been forced to close again. When open, Primark’s shops have enjoyed phenomenal sales but without a website to sell with, the business is paralysed without its stores. Primark’s fortunes will be likely to contrast with those of Asos, the clothing website for teens and twentysomethings, which has benefited from a slick delivery network able to satisfy demand for items ranging from stretchy leggings to face cream. Earlier this year the company was struggling to secure enough stock of some items, such was the unexpected demand: we will find out if that affected sales in December. The Shore Capital analyst Clive Black says 2020 was a “distorted” rather than merry Christmas for the high street. Of the winners so far, the City had expected the grocers to do well but Sainsbury’s had pulled the “rabbit out of the hat”. “Online retailers will have done very well,” says Black. “It is the non-essential, store-based retailers that have absolutely had their legs taken away. You’ve seen all the issues around Arcadia, Debenhams and Edinburgh Woollen Mill [which have all entered administration]. For store-based non-essential retailers, 2020 was a calamity of a year.”"
2021-01-09T16:00:25Z,business,Business,Is 'hysterical' market speculation pushing us towards another crash?,"Insurrections are not usually seen by investors as buy signals. Yet even as rioters stormed the seat of US legislative government last week, stock market indices hit new highs in New York, adding another chapter to 12 months of apparent defiance of economic gravity. Wall Street, measured by the benchmark S&P 500, was not alone in starting 2021 with a bang. London’s FTSE 100 jumped by more than 6% in the first week of the year as investors took in a heady cocktail of a President Joe Biden ready and able to spend money, cheap borrowing costs, and the hopes that vaccines will end the coronavirus lockdowns. Yet amid the exuberance a serious concern looms: are we on the cusp of another colossal crash? Some veteran investors believe so. Jeremy Grantham, the British co-founder of the US investment firm GMO, gave some of his fellow investors pause last week when he described “a fully fledged epic bubble” that has grown out of the recovery from the financial crisis of 2008-09. “Featuring extreme overvaluation, explosive price increases, frenzied issuance, and hysterically speculative investor behaviour, I believe this event will be recorded as one of the great bubbles of financial history,” he wrote in a letter to investors. Analysts at Bank of America joined him last Friday, warning of “frothy prices, greedy positioning” and telling their clients to sell equities. There is a growing divide in the investment world: on the one side are believers that the recovery from the pandemic will add extra impetus to stock markets; on the other are those who think that bubbles are inflating to bursting point. There are relatively few investors who do not admit to the existence of speculative bubbles in some parts of the financial markets. The mania for bitcoin, the cryptocurrency, appeared to have dissipated in December 2017, when prices fell from just short of $20,000 to dip below $4,000 in 2019. But enthusiasm for bitcoin is back: after passing the $20,000 mark in December, its price has doubled and hit highs near $42,000 last Friday.
Other contenders for bubble status are Tesla and fellow electric car pioneer rivals such as Nikola and China’s Nio, whose shares have surged in value as investors scramble to stake claims in the green-transition gold rush. The spectacular tenfold increase in Tesla’s market value since the start of 2020 made chief executive Elon Musk the world’s richest person last week. The carmaker is worth more than the next seven most valuable legacy carmakers combined, despite making a fraction of their profits. Yet bitcoin and Tesla have by no means been the only beneficiaries. While 2020 for most of us will be remembered as the year we were confined to our homes, for financial markets it was a year in which prices escaped their constraints. Paul Tudor Jones, a billionaire hedge fund manager, last month pointed out that more companies were priced at more than 100 times their earnings than at any other point in history – and about 50% more than during the dotcom bubble of the early 2000s. Guy Monson, chief investment officer at Sarasin & Partners, a London-based investment firm, said 2020 was marked by “near universal asset-price inflation”, a direct consequence of central banks injecting trillions of dollars into the economy by buying government bonds through a process known as quantitative easing (QE). The virus effectively caused a “no-fault downturn”, said Monson, meaning there was little political pushback against bailouts from government and central banks. Unlike overextended bankers in the banking crisis of 2008-09, it was difficult to blame pub owners or hairdressers for a government order to shut up shop. Central bank asset purchases under QE ran at roughly three times the rate of the financial crisis at the height of the pandemic, Monson added. The main question keeping investors awake at night is whether Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell and counterparts such as the European Central Bank’s Christine Lagarde or the Bank of England’s Andrew Bailey will ever be able to raise interest rates to anything like their pre-2008 levels. Even a hint that the Fed might try to reduce the flow of stimulus has been enough to depress markets in the past, notably during the “taper tantrum” of 2013. The jump in borrowing costs was enough to persuade central bankers that taking away support would cause painful stock market drops.
Some argue that, by certain yardsticks, market valuations are not quite as over-inflated. The S&P 500 is worth about 22 times predicted earnings for 2021, higher than the long-term average of about 16, but lower than the 30 hit before the dotcom bubble burst, according to Kiran Ganesh, a multi-asset strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management. “This is an environment to be pro-risk,” he said, pointing to cyclical companies that struggled during the early stages of the pandemic, such as big industrial manufacturers, banks and utilities companies. However, he warned against “Fomo” – the bubble-stoking fear of missing out – drawing people towards companies that had already seen their values rocket. Ganesh added that there was little sign central banks had the desire or the ability to raise interest rates and bond yields, which move inversely to prices, above historically low levels, providing the conditions for continued stock market gains. There were particular opportunities for UK companies to catch up with the US, he added, in part because of a Brexit deal that reduced uncertainty, albeit at the cost of raising other trade barriers. But others believe central bankers’ efforts to stave off financial collapse have stored up problems for the future, and already low interest rates mean they will have little room for manoeuvre if inflation rises or – perhaps more likely – growth does not meet investors’ great expectations. Central banks were “already vastly overextended” before the pandemic, said Sven Henrich, founder of market analysts NorthmanTrader. Central bankers knew their policies were feeding a stock market bubble with the side effect of fuelling inequality between already wealthy shareholders and those who could not take part in the equity boom, he argued. However, their inability to retreat without causing panic would cause problems if they lost control, he said. “The concern I have is they have created a massive asset bubble and price distortion,” Henrich said. “They have created this monster that they need to keep feeding.”"
2021-01-09T08:39:53Z,business,Business,Will the UK experience a double-dip recession in 2021? Almost certainly,"Harold Wilson was prime minister and Margaret Thatcher the newly elected leader of the opposition. Lord’s hosted the first cricket world cup final, David Bowie released Young Americans and inflation reached a post-war high of more than 25%. That was Britain in 1975, the last time the economy endured a double-dip recession. Until now, in all likelihood. When the Office for National Statistics releases growth figures for November next Friday the data is expected to show UK on course to contract in the final three months of 2020. An economy that was already losing momentum in the early autumn was further hampered by the four-week lockdown in England that ended in early December. Lockdown 3 – which came into force earlier this week – guarantees that the economy will be weaker still in the first three months of 2021, even if the government’s vaccination programme goes as planned and restrictions can be gradually eased from mid-February onwards. Two successive quarters of falling gross domestic product (GDP) are needed to qualify for a recession and a double-dip involves two recessions, separated by a small gap: something now highly probable, but not inevitable.
Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation, says it is still “technically possible that the fourth quarter of 2020 wasn’t a fall, but it probably was”. On an annual basis, 2020 will record the biggest drop in national output since 1709. There was, of course, no ONS during the “Great Frost” of that year, but such evidence as there is suggests the 15% drop in output was a short, sharp shock. It might not technically have even been a recession by modern standards, although it would have felt like one. Today measuring the economy is a lot more sophisticated. The ONS reports monthly GDP figures with a short lag, and during the pandemic has been providing more timely snapshots with the help of traffic usage, retail footfall and Google searches. When the crisis began a little less than a year ago, the assumption was that the UK would go backwards in the first half of 2020 but then recover much of the lost ground by the year’s end. But the bounce in the third quarter of last year proved fleeting and the economy will end 2020 more than 10% smaller than it was in the final months of 2019. The closest the UK has been to a double-dip recession since the mid-1970s was in the early 2010s when the ONS initially reported a second two-quarter fall in output after the arrival in power of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government but found later that the economy had performed better than initially feared.
“You do have to be careful about data revisions,” says Rory MacQueen, principal economist at the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR), a leading thinktank. “There was the double-dip recession that never was under the coalition government, which was eventually revised away. “Having said that, our most recent forecast is for negative growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 and it’s hard to imagine the first quarter of 2021 being positive.” NIESR is currently pencilling in a 1.5% drop in output in the final three months of last year – a big quarterly drop by pre-pandemic standards. Analysts agree, though, that the state of the UK differs from previous recessions. There has been no oil shock as there was in late 1973, no three-day week as there was in early 1974, no monetarist experiment with high interest rates and an over-valued pound as there was in the early 1980s, no housing market crash as there was in the early 1990s, no near-death experience for the banks as there was in the financial crisis of just over a decade ago. “This is not really a recession in the normal sense of the word,” says Martin Beck of the consultancy firm Oxford Economics. “It’s artificial hibernation by diktat of the government.”
Beck thinks that once the constraints are removed, the economy will recover fast. He expects output to fall by 1% in the fourth quarter of 2020 followed by a further 4.5% contraction in the current three-month period. After that, he is pencilling in growth of 9% in the second quarter as the sectors closed due to social distancing rules such as non-essential retail, hospitality and leisure – reopen for business. This, though, assumes there are no hitches in the vaccination programme and that new strains of the coronavirus don’t emerge over the coming weeks. The projected timing of the recovery has already been pushed back from the first to the second quarter of 2021. While a setback, the second leg of the 2020-21 double-dip recession will not be as severe as the first. Manufacturing and construction have stayed open this time, firms have adapted their business models in response to social distancing, and consumers have found they can spend money as easily online as they can in shops. But as Beck points out, the economy is also starting from a much lower base and with companies already closed. “You can’t shut a nightclub twice,” he says."
2021-01-09T08:01:15Z,business,Business,Dormant asset scheme to be expanded beyond bank accounts,"Savers who have lost track of pension and investment funds will have their money used for charitable causes that could aid Covid recovery efforts under government plans to expand its dormant asset scheme beyond bank accounts. The Reclaim Fund was established in 2011 to distribute the cash from bank and building society accounts that were left unclaimed for at least 15 years. It came after banks were accused of bolstering their balance sheets by sitting on dormant savings.
It has already helped with Covid recovery efforts, having released £150m from the fund to help charities, social enterprises and vulnerable individuals during the outbreak in May. About 30 banks and building societies take part in the scheme, but the new programme will open to City firms across the insurance, pensions, investment and wealth management sectors after the government puts forward legislation to expand it. Each sector will have their own guidelines determining when assets should be shifted to the Reclaim Fund. Firms are expected to make reasonable efforts to track down customers and reunite them with their accounts before transferring them to the Reclaim Fund, which has so far distributed £745m to charitable causes.
However, only a small proportion of deposits are ever recovered by their rightful owners after they are transferred, at a rate of just 5% a year. In total, customers have only reclaimed £93m since the fund was established, which is less than 7% of the £1.35bn collected over the same period and lower than the £147m transferred in 2019 alone. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (took the decision after a four-year review concluded there was widespread support for the scheme’s extension. It said customers would still be able to apply to reclaim their assets in full at any time, and said the expanded scheme “will have consumer protection at its heart, with the priority continuing to be locating and reuniting people with their financial assets”. The voluntary scheme has run into controversy. Earlier this year, the Guardian revealed that HSBC had been warned by its own compliance staff in 2017 that it was not doing enough to reunite customers with their cash before freezing their accounts, and was potentially harming elderly and vulnerable savers who may have lost track of their savings. HSBC denied it had mistreated customers, or that it took insufficient action, and said it had made “substantial and continuous improvements” to its dormant account policy since 2016."
2021-01-09T08:00:17Z,business,Business,Norway's electric car drive belies national reliance on fossil fuels,"Norway became the first country to sell more electric cars than petrol, hybrid and diesel engines put together last year, new data shows, with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) accounting for two-thirds of sales in the final months of 2020. Norway has one of the world’s most ambitious green targets, planning to phase out sales of all new fossil-fuel vehicles by 2025, five years earlier than the UK. It is quite a contradiction in a country that has become one of the richest in the world on the back of its oil and gas revenues, has made itself dependent on oil, and clings to further production even as the world increasingly rejects fossil fuels in pursuit of zero emissions.
While on the one hand the government is auctioning oil exploration licences for fields in the fragile Arctic, on the other it is aiming for a carbon-neutral national vehicle park by 2030. On Friday, it submitted its national plan on climate, which included this ambitious aim and the promise that, from next year, the public sector would be required to procure zero-emission vehicles only. While Norway is still one of the world’s big oil producers, it gets more than 90% of its power from hydroelectric sources. This goes some way to explain why the introduction of electric vehicles has been such a winner: as long as the rivers and waterfalls don’t run dry, this is an infinite source of power that can also be applied to vehicles. Even up north, where distances between settlements are vast and the winter cold extreme, the electric car is gaining a stronghold. Christina Bu, head of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association, said: “During the autumn of last year, we saw an increase of up to 40% of the market share in the northernmost districts of Norway, Troms and Finnmark.” Behind the success lay a long-term political strategy, she said. “One might assume this is all about subsidies. It is not. It’s all about taxing what we don’t want and promoting what we do want.”
Norway has some of the highest taxes in the world on what it regards as luxury goods, which includes cars. So reduced taxes on vehicles, with numerous incentives, is bound to entice car buyers. There is a range of incentives and exemptions including: • No vehicle purchase tax (a big levy which helps push up the average price for a vehicle in Norway to £43,000-£46,000, compared with an EU average of £26,000-£29,000) • No VAT – usually 25% • Zero road tax • Free parking in some municipal car parks • Reduced tax on company electric cars (at a lower rate than fossil-fuel vehicles) • Reduced or free tolls in some areas • Driving in a bus lane if carrying a passenger • 50% discount on some car parks, tolls and ferry fares The ambitious political strategy goes back to the late 1990s, when it was introduced to stimulate production of Norwegian electric cars and to reduce emissions. It hasn’t entirely worked out that way. Norwegian-produced BEVs are still noticeable by their absence, to the delight of foreign car producers. But the number of electric cars sold has soared, from 3% of total sales in 2012, to 54% in 2020. There are 2.8m vehicles on Norway’s roads and more than 260,000 are fully electric, nearly 9% of the total car stock. Next year nearly 40 new BEV models will go on the market in Norway, more than the number of fossil-fuel and hybrid models.
“Norway has certainly paved the way for the industry,” said Per Espen Stoknes, who is an MP for the Green party, a TED global speaker and an assistant professor at BI Norwegian business school as well as a psychologist, whose latest book is on the psychology of climate action. Stoknes described the process of expanding the national BEV park as “a green tax shift”, which he thought any country could afford if they focused on the right things. As a psychologist, he also emphasised the power of social pressure, in particular in densely populated cities. “We have been able to prove statistically that there is a keeping-up-with-the-Joneses effect. That is to say, if someone in a street buys a BEV, the neighbours are more likely to follow suit. It can turn into a greener-than-thou competition in which envy, as always, is a powerful driving force.” As in the UK, the big challenge is the installation of charging points around the country. There are now 3,200 rapid charge points, run by about 10 companies, which are working to develop ever faster chargers. There are still problems, particularly on the busiest travel days, with BEV drivers facing long queues and chargers that are out of commission. Bu said: “We have to constantly encourage the development of further and more reliable chargers.” The more electric cars are sold, the harder it is for critics to be heard. However, although BEVs are environmentally friendly in a local context, globally they still leave big climate footprint. The manufacture of BEV batteries requires expensive and rare metals, while the secure disposal of used and broken batteries is a problem. Both concerns are conveniently palmed off on poor, vulnerable countries – such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, which produces 60% of the world’s Cobalt – that lack the legislation to deal with them."
2021-01-08T17:54:55Z,business,Business,Surveyors draft plan to free homeowners from fire safety limbo,"Flatowners who have struggled to sell their homes because of fire safety risks, despite not having any cladding on their building, could soon be able to find buyers after surveyors proposed changes to how the properties are valued. Following the Grenfell fire tragedy banks and building societies have taken extra steps to ensure buildings have passed fire safety checks before offering mortgages on homes within them. Since December 2019, surveyors working for lenders have relied on proof of an inspection by an expert outlined in an ESW1 form to show that a building does not have any dangerous cladding and will not need expensive works to put right. However, some homeowners have been asked for a form when selling or remortgaging flats where there is no cladding in place, and found that their properties are effectively worthless without one. Last year, the government said 450,000 flatowners had been “stuck in limbo” in properties with no cladding which might be deemed unmortgageable and lifted its requirement for checks on these buildings. Now a consultation from the surveyors’ group Rics has proposed new guidelines for its members to decide whether an EWS1 form is needed. For buildings below four storeys it says it is unlikely that an EWS1 is needed if there is no aluminium or metal composite (ACM or MCM) cladding in place. On higher buildings, it has outlined rules on balconies, and when other kinds of cladding should prompt an inspection. Ben Elder, head of valuation standards at Rics, said government advice and lending criteria had changed since the form was introduced. “EWS1 was never intended to hold up the market, indeed without it, no one would be moving,” he added. The National Housing Federation (NHF), which represents housing associations that own some of the buildings in question, said the proposals were encouraging. Victoria Moffett, head of building and fire safety programmes at the NHF, said: “This situation is now critical, with many leaseholders, also affected by the pandemic, at serious risk of losing their homes or becoming bankrupt because they cannot remortgage or sell.”
However, she said upfront funding for safety work was needed from the government. “This is the only way to satisfy lenders that leaseholders will not face large bills for potential safety work in the future, and ultimately allow people to sell and remortgages.” The consultation will close on 25 January 2021, with the new guidance given to surveyors in the spring."
2021-01-08T16:47:58Z,business,Business,Hyundai's value surges by $9bn amid reports of Apple electric car deal,"Hyundai’s value surged by $9bn (£6.6bn) on Friday after reports that it could join with Apple in developing a driverless electric vehicle – despite confusion as it backtracked on a statement acknowledging “early discussion” with the iPhone manufacturer. Investors sent the South Korean carmaker’s share price on the Seoul exchange up almost 20%, as local media reported a possible tie-up on electric cars and batteries with Apple, which has been developing its own vehicle technology. Reports on South Korea’s Economic Daily claimed the two firms were in talks. Hyundai originally issued a statement saying: “Apple and Hyundai are in discussion, but as it is early stage, nothing has been decided.” A subsequent statement to the stock exchange from Hyundai omitted any reference to Apple, merely saying there were “requests for cooperation on joint development of autonomous electric vehicles from various companies”. Last month it was reported that Apple was hoping to launch a self-driving personal vehicle by 2024, which, a source told Reuters, could represent an evolution in electric car battery technology in the way the iPhone evolved mobile phones. It was suggested that Apple could look for a traditional manufacturing partner to help make the car. Apple did not comment on the Hyundai statement. The scramble to invest in Hyundai comes after a year in which the share price of the market leader in electric vehicles, Tesla, has rocketed – to the extent that chief executive and major shareholder Elon Musk this week overtook Amazon’s Jeff Bezos as the world’s richest man. An Apple vehicle would have the design cachet to compete with the California company, which shipped almost 500,000 vehicles last year and has pushed the boundaries of autonomous driving as well as electric car technology.
Hyundai has been keen to burnish its credentials, last month announcing it would develop in-house its own electric car platform and battery systems, expecting to extend the range of a single charge to 500km. It has also had an eye on more futuristic technologies, establishing a self-driving joint venture, Motional, with car component supplier Aptiv and ploughing $2bn into the new firm. Motional has announced plans with ride-hailing firm Lyft to launch robotaxis in the US from 2023. An investor in robotics firms, Hyundai in 2019 unveiled a concept “walking” robocar for tougher terrain. Apple is notoriously tight-lipped about its product development plans but it has been reported to have been working on Project Titan, its electric and autonomous car vision, since 2014."

2021-01-08T14:13:39Z,business,Business,Why global markets appear impervious to bad news,"The global economy has just had its worst year of the modern age and 2021 has not got off to the best of starts either. Yet stock markets appear impervious to bad news, with the MSCI World Index of developed market shares 10% above its pre-crisis peak. There are a number of reasons why equity markets are so hot. Central bank action. Led by the US Federal Reserve, central banks were quick to respond to the market turmoil that accompanied the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in February and March last year. Interest rates were cut and money was pumped into the global economy through asset-purchase schemes known as quantitative easing. Just as importantly, the Fed gave the impression that it would not allow share prices on Wall Street to fall too far. Vaccine optimism. Stock markets tend to be influenced by the outlook in the future rather than the current state of the world, and are convinced that growth will pick up sharply once mass vaccine programmes allow governments to relax physical-distancing regulations. The assumption is that from the spring onwards activity will surge, leading to higher corporate earnings, which in turn would justify higher share prices.
Bidenomics. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up by 60% since Donald Trump has been president but Wall Street has found a reason to be cheerful about the arrival of his successor, Joe Biden. The victory by the Democrats in the byelections for Georgia’s two Senate seats means it will be easier for Biden to get a stimulus package through Congress. For now, bullish investors are ignoring the fact that Biden also pledged to toughen up regulation, which they tend to think is negative for the market, and are instead focusing on the boost they hope Bidenomics will give to growth. What else is there? There are alternatives to investing in the stock market, such as cash and gold, but the low level of official interest rates and the depressing impact of QE on bond yields have made taking the risk of investing in equities more attractive. The Bank of England is currently weighing up the pros and cons of negative interest rates, which further tip the balance in favour of holding riskier assets with a higher potential yield, such as equities. All of the above. The current mindset of the market is that there is now light at the end of the Covid-19 tunnel. Normal life is going to resume but inflation is not going to pick up, so central banks and finance ministries will be under no pressure to withdraw stimulus any time soon. In the event that share prices do take a tumble, the Fed will ride to the rescue."
2021-01-08T14:01:46Z,business,Business,US jobs numbers drop dramatically as Covid cases soar across the country,"The recovery in the US jobs market collapsed in December, the last full month of Donald Trump’s presidency, as coronavirus infections soared across the country. The US lost 140,000 jobs in December, down from a gain of 245,000 in November, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The loss ended seven months of jobs growth with the leisure and hospitality sector once again bearing the biggest losses. The unemployment rate stayed at 6.7%, close to twice as high as it was in February before Covid-19 hit the US. It is also three percentage points higher than the 4.5% rate Trump inherited from his predecessor Barack Obama. Some 372,000 jobs were lost in food services and drinking places, offsetting gains in other areas, as Covid-19 infections and deaths rose sharply across the country. “The decline in payroll employment reflects the recent increase in coronavirus (Covid-19) cases and efforts to contain the pandemic,” the BLS said. Four million Americans have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more – technically defined as long-term unemployed – accounting for 37% of those out of work. Unemployment rates for black (9.9%) and Latino (9.3%) workers remained sharply higher than for white Americans (6%). After months of wrangling Congress passed a $900bn stimulus package in December but the relief came too late for many. Joe Biden has pledged more aid for those hit by the pandemic’s economic fallout but areas like hospitality are likely to continue suffering until the virus is under control. Friday’s latest jobs report comes after months of worrying signs in the jobs market. On Thursday the labor department said another 787,000 people had filed first-time claims for jobless benefits in the week ending 2 January. The figure was slightly lower than the previous week but remained more than twice as high as pre-pandemic levels. On Wednesday ADP, the US’s largest payroll supplier, said the private sector had shed 123,000 jobs from November to December, the first decline since April 2020. Losses were primarily concentrated in retail, leisure and hospitality – all areas that suffered heavy losses in the first wave of the pandemic. On the same day minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting showed policymakers expected the escalating number of coronavirus cases “would be particularly challenging for the labor market in coming months”. The crisis has left millions of Americans facing food shortages and homelessness as unemployment officers across the country have struggled to keep up with the huge numbers of claims. According to the Associated Press only three states, North Dakota, Rhode Island and Wyoming, have met the federal standard of getting benefit payments out to successful claimants within three weeks for 87% of applicants."
2021-01-08T13:16:20Z,business,Business,Brexit and Covid blamed as Asia-UK shipping rates increase fourfold,"The cost of importing containers filled with consumer goods from Asia into the UK has reached a record high after a surge in demand in the weeks before Christmas and the UK’s exit from the EU. Shipping experts believe the UK has been dealt a double blow by the impact of the coronavirus, which has disrupted global shipping supply chains, and the end of the Brexit transition period, which caused a large increase in imports in the last months of 2020. Container freight rates from Asia have increased almost fourfold since November to reach $10,000 for a 40ft unit for the first time, amid a global rebound in demand for consumer goods and materials, and congestion across UK ports, where many empty containers have been left stranded. Vincent Clerc, chief commercial officer for Maersk, the world’s biggest shipping company, said on Wednesday there were “simply not enough containers in the world to cope with the current demand”. He said that recent lockdowns in the UK and across Europe may even spur further online purchases of consumer goods such as home exercise equipment and furniture for “at least for some weeks … It is really crazy how much we are moving at the moment, huge amounts,” he said.
Giant container carriers left off the coast of Singapore during the most stringent coronavirus measures last spring have already re-entered the shipping market to help ship containers to Europe, according to Simon Sundboell, boss of maritime intelligence company eeSea. “Demand is back to pre-coronavirus levels, it may be even stronger. Perhaps people are buying TV screens rather than going on holiday to Thailand,” he said. However, the shipping slowdown in the early months of 2020 had made filling empty shipping containers with goods more difficult, because it had upended the complex global shipping sector, he said. Simon Wolfson, the boss of fashion retailer Next, said earlier this week that the company’s clothing stock was down 10% compared with last year owing to shipment delays of two to three weeks from Asia. “It is not getting it into the country that’s the problem; it’s getting it into a container at the other end,” he said. George Griffiths, the head of global container freight markets at S&P Global Platts, said the lack of empty containers in Asian ports was at the root of soaring container prices. The S&P Global Platts index for container freight prices, which reached a record $10,000 earlier this week, was likely to rise further and may push up the cost of consumer goods, he said. “The ongoing problem is that there’s just a lack of empty containers in key exporting hubs, specifically across Asia, so there aren’t any available to export goods into the Europe and UK markets. This has created a real imbalance,” he said.
The global rebound in shipping demand has been compounded by Britain’s hurry to stock up on materials and goods before the Christmas season and the severing of ties with the EU. This left many shipping containers stranded by warehouses and on the quayside of ports across the UK and Europe, after the influx of freight at the end of last year. In the past, it would have taken two to three days for a container arriving in the UK to be unloaded at the nearby warehouses and return to the port to begin the journey back to where it came from. But in recent months, in some cases it has taken the skeleton port staff, working under Covid-19 restrictions, two to three weeks to empty containers, Griffiths said. The incoming cargoes, which included 11,000 containers of medical PPE, plunged the UK’s ports into chaos, with mountains of containers piling up. Although the container stacks were beginning to shrink, rebalancing the global supply chain was expected to take months, in part because of coronavirus working restrictions.
“Some container liners won’t stop [in the UK] because it’s not worth incurring the hours of delay and higher costs. Those liners which are willing to stop in the UK are charging a premium, given the limited supply,” Griffiths said. He said the “self-perpetuating cycle” posed a risk to UK exports, and also the much-needed return of empty containers to Asia, which could help to lower the cost of UK imports. The pattern was expected to last at least until after the lunar new year in the middle of next month, but could continue until the second quarter of this year. A spokesperson for Felixstowe, Britain’s biggest container port, declined to comment."
2021-01-08T13:15:39Z,business,Business,"New Â£90m Asos investment to create 2,000 jobs","Asos is investing £90m in a new distribution centre in Lichfield, Staffordshire, that will handle parcels for its online clothing and beauty business and employ 2,000 people over the next three years. The 437,000 sq ft warehouse at Fradley Park is expected to begin operating within 12 months and serve customers in both the UK and overseas. Asos’s main distribution centre near Barnsley, operated by XPO Logistics, employs more than 4,000 people and the company also has warehouse hubs in Berlin and Atlanta. Expansion at the online fashion retailer comes after a strong year for companies that sell over the internet as multiple high street lockdowns to control the spread of the Covid-19 virus have accelerated the shift to home shopping.
The British company quadrupled profits and increased sales by 19% to £3.3bn in the year to 31 August as shoppers snapped up comfy casual clothing suitable for working from home and beauty products to improve their looks for video conferencing. Some British retailers have had difficulties shipping goods to Europe since the end of the Brexit transition period this month because of tariffs imposed on items not made in the UK. Asos is able to continue selling goods via its European websites without additional duty because they are sent out from its warehouse in Berlin.
The company said deliveries to Northern Ireland were also continuing under a three-month grace period on new red tape associated with Brexit. Some UK firms have experienced difficulties exporting items to the region this month because of new checks and paperwork required under the Northern Ireland protocol. There could be further disruption for companies such as Asos from April when the grace period ends. Nick Beighton, chief executive of Asos, said: “We’re thrilled to be laying down the foundations for our future growth in Lichfield. This significant investment in infrastructure and large-scale job creation is a reflection of the confidence Asos has in its future and the quality of the skills and talent available in this well-placed location.” Doug Pullen, leader of Lichfield district council, said the creation of new local jobs was welcome news. “Asos’s clear ambition to contribute in a meaningful way to the communities in which it’s based is incredibly assuring, as is its track record of working closely with the Community trade union to ensure staff are properly looked after.”"
2021-01-08T11:07:17Z,business,Business,Percy Pigs in Ireland hit by Brexit red tape as M&S warns of tariffs,"Percy Pig has emerged as one of the first casualties of Brexit red tape, with Marks & Spencer warning that its famous pink sweets could be hit with new import taxes in Ireland. The sweets are among the more than 2,000 products sold in M&S food halls that are affected by the “rules of origin” regulations set out in the trade deal struck with the EU. The rules dictate whether import taxes, called tariffs, must be paid based on where a product’s ingredients come from and where it has been manufactured.
Steve Rowe, the chief executive of M&S, gave the example of its bestselling Percy Pig sweets, which are manufactured in Germany and brought to the UK before being re-exported to Ireland – a journey that would now be subject to import taxes. “About a third of the products in our food business are subject to complex rules of origin around componentry and how much has been altered in the UK,” Rowe said. “Depending on that, there is a variable rate of tariff on goods. Tariff-free does not feel like tariff-free when you read the fine print.” The UK’s free trade agreement has spared Marks & Spencer’s domestic business from tariffs but would “significantly impact” the retailer in Ireland, where it has 18 stores, as well as in the Czech Republic and France. The “scope and complexity” of the new rules meant many retailers would have to “find an expensive workaround”, Rowe said. The rules of origin do not affect products sold in its stores over the border in Northern Ireland.
The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said at least 50 of its members were facing potential tariffs for re-exporting goods to the EU. William Bain, the BRC’s trade policy adviser, said it was trying to come up with short-term options and “seeking dialogue with the government and the EU on longer-term solutions to mitigate the effects of new tariffs”. He added: “We need a solution which genuinely reflects the needs of UK-EU supply and distribution chains for goods.”"
2021-01-08T10:57:56Z,business,Business,Brexit costs and delays push Scottish seafood firms into crisis,"Scottish seafood firms say their businesses are in crisis because of Brexit-related delays and costs exporting fresh seafood and salmon to Europe. Seafood exporters and fishers have suspended exports of live seafood and fresh fish, seen customers cancel orders or have failed to get their produce to market on time because of new export regulations and procedures. Some fear that the trade, worth more than £1bn to Scottish businesses, is on the brink of collapse because the new rules require every box of fresh seafood and salmon to be offloaded from lorries and inspected by vets before they leave Scotland. That had been taking five hours per lorry this week, trade bodies said. Santiago Buesa, of SB Fish in Troon, Ayrshire, said: “Our customers are pulling out. [We] are fresh product and the customers expect to have it fresh, so they’re not buying. It’s a catastrophe.” The extra paperwork, export certificates and Covid tests for drivers has added hundreds of pounds in costs to every shipment, firms said. Before Brexit, Scottish exporters were able to get their fresh salmon fillets, live langoustine, crabs, mussels and scallops to the main fish market in Boulogne in 24 hours. On Tuesday, computer problems at the port in Boulogne led to lorries being diverted via Dunkirk and to shipments failing to get to market in time. France is the largest overseas market for Scottish salmon: sales there in 2019 were worth £221m. James Cook, at the seafood firm D R Collins & Sons in Eyemouth near Berwick, said those complications had meant shipments earlier this week took three days to arrive in Boulogne. He was now considering stopping fishing and on Thursday had suspended exports. “Normally we’d have had maybe three lorries a day leaving Eyemouth. We’ve had to suspend everything,” Cook told BBC Radio Scotland. “Trading in Europe has now become a lottery and it’s a form of gambling, so you have to be very, very brave to put all your resources and energy into trying [to] press a button and find out that you don’t even pass the first hurdle. It’s a total loss of confidence.” James Withers, chief executive of the trade body Scotland Food and Drink, said the industry, customs officials, Food Standards Scotland and the Scottish government were trying to find ways to streamline the processes. That could involve allowing sample inspections of lorries carrying only one species, such as farmed salmon, from one supplier. “There is a major collective effort to work through all this between industry and government. That is critical because the knock-on effect of disruption is significant and can grind the seafood supply chain, from fishing boats to haulage, to a halt very quickly,” Withers said. “On the back of a horrendous 2020 and a nightmare before Christmas due to the French border closure, the financial impact of that would be grave for many.” Some industry officials argue privately that exporters have had months to prepare but are still not producing the right paperwork. That has increased delays. It had been known that in many cases, every crate would need to be inspected. But fishing bodies say there are too few vets at the certification hubs. Fergus Ewing, Scotland’s rural economy secretary, said this week: “We know how frustrating, time-consuming and indeed costly this is for Scottish businesses – we warned the UK government that we needed much more clarity much sooner than we got on what the export process would involve. “It is far better for problems to be identified and resolved here in Scotland and not have consignments being turned back hundreds of miles away or refused when they arrive at the end of their journey.”"
2021-01-08T09:57:05Z,business,Business,Housebuilder Barratt ups sales forecast amid pent-up demand,"Barratt Developments, Britain’s biggest housebuilder, has upped its forecast for the number of houses it expects to sell this year, buoyed by a surge in post-lockdown demand as buyers seek to complete before the end of the government’s stamp duty holiday and the tightening of the help-to-buy scheme. Barratt has started the year with fewer available homes to sell after a barnstorming period last summer and autumn following the first national lockdown, when sales boomed by 24% over four months. The company said the rate of sales had since “normalised” but that completions were still up 9.2% year on year at 9,077 in the six months to December.
Despite having fewer homes available for sale in the first quarter this year, which leaves Barratt more heavily reliant on construction activity, it has raised its completion forecast for its financial year, which ends in June. “Based on current market conditions and site construction activity, we now expect wholly owned completions to be between 15,250 and 15,750 homes,” said Barratt, which in October had forecast between 14,500 and 15,000 completions. “We have delivered an excellent first-half performance,” the company said. “During the first half we saw an increased sales rate as strong underlying demand was supplemented by pent-up demand from the initial national lockdown, the introduction of the stamp duty holiday and the March 2021 end of help to buy for existing homeowners.” Barratt, which intends to resume its shareholder dividend from next month, said its order book is already more than 90% forward sold for this financial year. It has an order book of 13,588 homes, up 14% year on year, valued at £3.2bn, up 19% year on year. The company said that the average sale price of a private home rose 2.2% in the second half of last year to £319,000. The total average selling price, including affordable homes sold, rose 1.1% to £283,000.
The housing sector was given a major boost in July when the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced the suspension of stamp duty on sales of properties up to £500,000. However, the stamp duty holiday is due to end on 31 March. From April the help-to-buy scheme – introduced in 2013 to allow people to buy new-build homes with a deposit from as little as 5%, with up to 20% of the property’s sale price covered by a government loan – will be restricted to first-time buyers only. It will be scrapped completely in March 2023. “Barratt has coped well in 2020; arguably, the real test starts now,” said Dan Lane, a senior analyst at Freetrade. “The end of the first lockdown released a buying frenzy in the UK; that’s not always going to be the case. Once stamp duty springs back and only first-time buyers can use help to buy, suddenly the need to get in quick will fade, too.”"
2021-01-08T08:32:55Z,business,Business,Marks & Spencer hit by clothing sales slump in key Christmas period,"Marks & Spencer said its clothing sales dropped by a quarter over the key Christmas trading period as the retailer was hit hard by store closures on the back of the Covid-19 lockdown. The outlook for trading “remains very challenging” because the latest lockdown could last until Easter, the retailer said.
Sales of clothing and homeware slumped by 24.1% in the 13 weeks to 26 December. The figure reflected a near-halving of store sales, which was partially offset by a similar-sized surge in online sales. The restrictions on socialising over Christmas meant that the big sellers were pyjamas and jogging bottoms rather than party outfits. Marks & Spencer’s food halls fared better, with sales at stores open one year up 2.6%. That figure rose to almost 6% when the impact of the closure of its large network of in-store cafes was stripped out. On the same basis, sales were up 8.7% in the four weeks before Christmas when the impact of closures was removed. Steve Rowe, M&S’s chief executive, said the company’s performance was “robust”, given the “on-off restrictions” and big changes in what shoppers were buying. He added that “beneath the Covid clouds” was a very strong performance from its food halls and improving trends in its clothing arm, which was struggling before the crisis.
The retailer said its international business had also been hit hard by pandemic restrictions, with sales down 10.4%. It also warned that the business was suffering because of Brexit. It faced potential tariffs on some of the products it exports to the EU as well as a very complex administrative process that would “significantly impact” its operations in Ireland, the Czech Republic and France. M&S slumped to a pre-tax loss of £87.6m in the first six months of its financial year after its clothing sales were affected by pandemic-related store closures. The chain is an essential retailer but its food halls have not experienced the same sales uplifts as the major supermarkets because many are convenience stores in currently empty city centres and train stations."
2021-01-08T00:00:22Z,business,Business,UK shops call for more help as footfall drops 43% in 2020,"Retailers are calling for more financial support from the government after shopper numbers dived more than two-fifths last year. The number of people out and about on high streets, retail parks and in shopping centres fell more than 43% after government-imposed lockdowns intended to control the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Numbers nearly halved in the all-important “golden quarter” between October and December, according to the latest figures from the British Retail Consortium and analysts at ShopperTrak. London was the hardest hit in December, with footfall down 58% as it was among the first areas to be put under the tougher tier 4 restrictions, which involved closing most high street stores, pubs and restaurants. Retail parks, where stores tend to be more spacious and there is parking, fared better than high streets and shopping centres. Wales and the south-east of England were the next worst-hit areas, while the north-west had the best end to the year, with sales down 36%. Liverpool enjoyed a period with only limited restrictions after its widespread testing effort. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium trade body, called on the government to extend a property tax holiday for retailers as high street lockdowns on non-essential retailers, including those selling clothing, toys and electronics, were set to continue this month and potentially beyond. “A third lockdown will be one too many for some businesses,” said Dickinson. “Rent bills continue to weigh heavily and the threat of a return to full business rates liability in April still looms. The government must urgently reassure those businesses hardest hit by the pandemic that they will receive vital financial support in the form of an extension to the coronavirus business rates relief.” The boss of Sainsbury’s, Simon Roberts, also backed calls for business rates reform on Thursday, saying that the Covid-19 epidemic had made a review of the tax “absolutely critical and very important”. “Covid needs to be the catalyst for change in the way business rates work,” Roberts said as he announced a surge in sales but falling profits at the UK’s second largest supermarket. Sainsbury’s was among a group of retailers who repaid millions of pounds in business rates relief after public outcry about the benefit going to big companies that have benefited from their status as “essential” retailers able to trade during high street lockdowns. But the relief has proved vital for the survival of smaller businesses and those prevented from opening high street stores for many months last year."
2021-01-07T21:33:20Z,business,Business,US fines Boeing $2.5bn following fraud charges tied to 737 Max crashes,"Boeing has been fined $2.5bn by the US justice department after being charged with fraud and conspiracy in connection with two fatal crashes of its 737 Max airliner.
Boeing’s employees chose “the path of profit over candor by concealing material information” from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US’s top airline regulator, David Burns, the acting assistant attorney general of the justice department’s criminal division, wrote in a release. Burns said the company had also engaged “in an effort to cover up their deception”. The Max was grounded worldwide in March 2019 after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people. A March 2020 congressional investigation concluded that Boeing promoted a “culture of concealment” and was “grossly inefficient” in its oversight of the Max’s development. At a heated congressional hearing in October 2019, Senator Richard Blumenthal accused Boeing of selling “flying coffins” as a result of its decision to conceal issues with the planes from pilots. “The tragic crashes of Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 exposed fraudulent and deceptive conduct by employees of one of the world’s leading commercial airplane manufacturers,” said Burns. Boeing admitted that two of its technical pilots deceived regulators about the safety of the Max’s MCAS stall prevention software, implicated in both of the fatal crashes. In both cases, the planes crashed shortly after takeoff when their pilots were unable to regain control of the planes after they went into a nosedive. The settlement includes $2.2bn in compensation to the families of the people killed in the two Max crashes and a $243m fine. In a statement, Boeing once more blamed its former employees. The “agreement is based on the conduct of two former Boeing employees and their intentional failure to inform the FAA Aircraft Evaluation Group (AEG), the group within the FAA responsible for making pilot training determinations, about changes to the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system (MCAS)”, the company said. David Calhoun, Boeing’s president and chief executive officer, said: “I firmly believe that entering into this resolution is the right thing for us to do – a step that appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations. “This resolution is a serious reminder to all of us of how critical our obligation of transparency to regulators is, and the consequences that our company can face if any one of us falls short of those expectations.” Boeing has now addressed concerns about the Max and the plane returned to service in the US in December. Lawyers for the families lost in the Ethiopian Airlines crash dismissed the settlement and said they would continue their litigation against Boeing. “The allegations in the deferred prosecution agreement are just the tip of the iceberg of Boeing’s wrongdoing – a corporation that pays billions of dollars to avoid criminal liability while stonewalling and fighting the families in court. This agreement, including the ‘crash-victim beneficiaries fund’, has no bearing on the pending civil litigation against Boeing, which we plan to prosecute fully to ensure the families receive the justice they deserve,” Clifford Law Offices said in a statement. They said the 737 Max should not have been returned to service “until all of the airplane’s deficiencies are addressed and it has undergone transparent and independent safety reviews – which to date still has not occurred”."
2021-01-07T19:39:30Z,business,Business,Sainsbury's is playing the long game by surrendering rates relief,"Sainsbury’s Christmas trading update was a demonstration of why the boards of all the big supermarket chains were obliged to come to their senses last month and concede that, yes, all that relief on business rates had to go back to the Treasury. After surrendering relief worth £410m this financial year, Sainsbury’s expects to achieve pre-tax profits of £330m, an uncomfortable year-on-year decline of 44% from the previous £586m. But consider the alternative: if it had kept the money, Sainsbury’s would now be forecasting profits this year of £740m, a year-on-year increase of 26%, which would have guaranteed endless publicity about profiting from a pandemic. That reputational gamble was never worth taking, especially when you are also in the business of lobbying government for permanent reform of the outdated rates system. The case for change was strong before Covid: the playing field, in the standard imagery, is tilted too far in favour of the online brigade. After Covid, the argument ought to be overwhelming. Just wait to see the boost to sales and profits that tax-shy Amazon will have enjoyed in the UK in 2020. A fairer system would whack up rates on warehouses (by 30% and 50%, Next’s chief executive, Simon Wolfson, has suggested) to fund reductions for shops and give battered high streets a lift. Such a move would merely reflect market reality – warehouses have soared in value since the last rates rejig; shops haven’t. The overall tax take from an evened-up system could even emerge roughly neutral. By playing fairly on relief (albeit only after some prodding), the supermarkets may have done themselves a favour in the long term. The need for a fundamental rewrite of the perverse business rates system is now crystal clear. The hospitality industry is crying out for clarity It’s a surprise that Mitchells & Butlers, the UK’s largest pubs company and one lumbered with the usual cellar-load of debt, has got this far into the pandemic without having to tap shareholders for extra cash. But the inevitable can no longer be delayed. Sales fell by two-thirds in the last quarter and, even in the weeks that pubs were allowed to open, trade ran at 30% below normal levels. The staff are mainly furloughed again but bills for insurance and suchlike still arrive. M&B calculates it is burning cash at the rate of £35-40m a month during lockdown. Then there’s £50m a quarter that goes on servicing borrowings of £1.5bn. With cash balances standing at only £125m, and the next debt payment due in mid-March, the need for fresh equity – as opposed to yet more borrowings – is blindingly obvious. The open question is how much to raise. The board hasn’t yet decided the price of prudence but the sum will surely have to be at least enough to finance another quarter of lockdown plus a bit on top – so £200m, say. That represents about a fifth of M&B’s shrunken stock market value, so should be doable with ease. It also helps, of course, that the share register is dominated by billionaires. Joe Lewis, owner of Tottenham Hotspur, has 23%, and Irish horse racing duo JP McManus and John Magnier jointly hold 27%. M&B’s crisis can be managed. Spare a thought, though, for independent publicans without M&B’s size or access to capital. The entire hospitality industry is crying out for clarity from the chancellor on whether the furlough scheme will be extended beyond April if necessary and if relief on business rates (for a sector that deserves it) will run beyond March. As argued here earlier this week, Rishi Sunak needs to decide – and quickly. Tesla’s share price surge is far too much, too soon We gasped when Tesla became worth $500bn last autumn, boosted by a crowd-pleasing five-for-one stock split. Now, just a few months later, and with entry into the S&P 500 index in the bag, the company is worth $750bn and Elon Musk, its pioneering founder and 21% shareholder, is the world’s richest person on paper. Tesla is a genuinely important company – there’s no longer any doubt on that score – and its technological lead in electric vehicles may survive for a long time and eventually also deliver success in battery storage. But a sevenfold increase in the share price in 2020 is inexplicable. It’s far too much, too soon, and seems to assume decades of sales growth has already happened. Tesla’s astonishing share price is also exhibit A in the bears’ argument that parts of the US stock market are in the grip of a mania. Their case is getting stronger."
2021-01-07T19:36:15Z,business,Business,'Call us back next week': E.ON customers furious over service meltdown,"Thousands of E.ON UK customers have accused the energy supplier of overlooking them after its customer service channels shut down for weeks after a major billing blunder, which left millions out of pocket before Christmas. During the winter’s coldest spell so far, many customers have been unable to top up their pre-pay energy meters, or contact the supplier to set up payment plans after being furloughed in the latest coronavirus lockdown. The supplier’s customer service phone line has asked people to “call us back next week” unless their query is an emergency, and its website and app have both crashed after a deluge of complaints from customers who were incorrectly billed twice last month. By Thursday afternoon many customers had still not received a refund after the supplier claimed an extra monthly direct debit from customers in the days leading up to Christmas, which plunged customers into unplanned overdrafts. Customers have turned to social media to warn that many will be left without lights and heating if they are unable to add credit to their energy meters online, or to request financial assistance. “The problems are far larger than just the direct debit debacle,” an E.ON customer said. “They’ve not been answering their phones since the 22nd of December, or the [webchat] messenger, or emails. Customers have been without power where pre-payment cards aren’t working. It’s the worst customer service ever.” “I’ve been trying to set up a payment arrangement due to being furloughed for the third time, have been unable to speak to anyone, and today received an email threatening debt collectors at my door. [It’s] very stressful,” the customer added. E.ON’s energy problems emerged days after new mandatory regulations came into effect in mid-December, which require all energy suppliers to offer struggling customers debt repayment plans or top-up credit if they are on prepay energy meters to help households through the coronavirus crisis. A spokesman for the energy watchdog, Ofgem, said it is crucial that suppliers ensure that their customers can “quickly get in touch with them when things go wrong”. A spokesman for E.ON said on Thursday evening that the company has repaid all direct debits taken in error last month and is “working hard” to bring on new measures to “resume normal service as soon as possible”. E.ON customers who are still struggling to top up their pre-pay meters can call the automated top-up line on 0800 015 6368 or the dedicated “pay as you go” support line on 0345 366 5995."
2021-01-07T19:12:02Z,business,Business,Elon Musk becomes world's richest person,"Elon Musk, the maverick boss of Tesla, has overtaken Amazonâ€™s Jeff Bezos to become the worldâ€™s richest person, after shares in the electric car company he co-founded soared on hopes that a Democrat-controlled US Senate would usher in a new green agenda. A 4.8% rise in Teslaâ€™s share price was enough to push Musk into the top spot according to the Bloomberg billionaires index, which tracks the daily changes in the fortunes of the worldâ€™s 500 wealthiest people. The 49-year-old entrepreneurâ€™s net worth hit $186bn (Â£136bn) at 10.15am in New York on Wednesday, making him $1.5bn richer than Bezos, who had held the top spot since October 2017. Musk responded to the news of his status as the worldâ€™s richest person with tweets stating â€œhow strangeâ€� and â€œwell, back to work â€¦â€�
Musk said he intended to use half of his fortune to â€œhelp problems on Earthâ€� and â€œhalf to help establish a self-sustaining city on Mars to ensure continuation of life (of all species) in case Earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or WW3 happens & we destroy ourselvesâ€�. In a series of tweets that the South African-born billionaire pinned to the top of his timeline, Musk said the reason why he wants lots of money was â€œnot what you thinkâ€�. He said he had â€œvery little time for recreationâ€� and doesnâ€™t have â€œvacation homes or yachts or anything like thatâ€�.
It is less than two months since Musk, who helped found Tesla just 17 years ago, surpassed Microsoft founder Bill Gates to become the worldâ€™s second richest person. Teslaâ€™s share price has risen by more than sevenfold this year as demand for electric cars soared and governments announced further measures to wean the world off internal combustion engines. The market value of Tesla, which recently joined the S&P 500 index of the USâ€™s biggest companies, exceeded $700bn (Â£516bn) for the first time this week. That makes the company worth more than Toyota, Volkswagen, Hyundai, GM and Ford combined. Musk, who owns 20% of Teslaâ€™s shares, was the 35th richest person in the world at the start of 2020. He also owns the rocketship company SpaceX, which is transporting astronauts to the International Space Station in a deal with Nasa. Last year Musk named his seventh child X Ã† A-12. The babyâ€™s mother, the Canadian singer Grimes (real name Claire Boucher) explained that the name referred to â€œartificial intelligenceâ€�, a long range reconnaissance aircraft and her favourite song Archangel. Neither parent was sure how to pronounce the name.
Analysts said Teslaâ€™s value was buoyed by the Democratic victories in Georgia to take control of the US Senate, as it meant the US would probably introduce tax credits for electric vehicles and join the green agenda already set by many European countries. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said: â€œA blue Senate is very bullish and a potential â€˜game changerâ€™ for Tesla and the overall electric vehicle sector, with a more green-driven agenda now certainly in the cards for the next few years.â€� Expected US electric vehicle tax credits would benefit Tesla, â€œwhich continues to have an iron grip on the market todayâ€�, he added. Ives reckons Teslaâ€™s shares could hit $1,000 in a â€œbull-caseâ€� scenario, if the company can hit 1m electric car deliveries by 2022. Tesla was within a whisker of achieving his target of half-million cars last year. The California-based manufacturerâ€™s annual sales rose by 36% after a final quarter that exceeded analystsâ€™ expectations despite the pandemic to deliver a total of 499,550 cars in 2020. Muskâ€™s wealth could soar higher as Teslaâ€™s share price growth puts him on target for a bonus deal that could pay a record $55.8bn. However, fears are mounting that share prices could be rising far above real values and the bubble may burst in spectacular fashion.
Jeremy Grantham, the British co-founder of the US investment firm GMO and who is credited with calling the market peak in 2008, said current investor behaviour bore the hallmarks of the mood in the run-up to the 1929 Wall Street crash. â€œI believe this event will be recorded as one of the great bubbles of financial history, right along with the South Sea bubble, 1929, and 2000,â€� Grantham said in a letter to clients. SpaceX recently sent four astronauts to the International Space Station on its Falcon rocket and Dragon capsule in a commercial contract with Nasa. The company will also launch 60 broadband internet satellites into orbit. While Musk has delivered huge returns for investors, some have called for action against his vast pay deal and criticised his habit of engaging in expensive fights on Twitter.
Pirc, an influential adviser to shareholders, including the UKâ€™s local authority pension funds, last year recommended that investors voted against his pay deal because it â€œunfairly enriches the chief executiveâ€�. The shareholder adviser also called on investors to vote against re-electing Musk to the board because he posed â€œa serious risk of reputational harm to the company and its shareholdersâ€� in his derogatory tweets. In 2019 Musk was sued for $190m in defamation damages over tweets about the British caver Vernon Unsworth, who was helping to rescue 13 people trapped in a Thai cave. A jury found the tweets did not reach the legal standard for defamation and Musk was not found liable for damages."
2021-01-07T18:52:17Z,business,Business,‘We like to keep it simple’: the rapid rise of B&M’s Arora brothers,"The Arora brothers are the brains behind the rapid rise of B&M, the discount chain that has come from nowhere to take its place as one of the UK’s biggest retailers, and bank the entrepreneurial founders a multibillion-pound fortune. When Simon and Bobby Arora snapped up B&M in 2005, the company was a failing chain of just 21 stores where shoppers were greeted with what looked like a jumble sale. Today B&M is closing in on 700 UK stores, with annual sales expected to exceed £4bn this year for the first time. The once chaotic layout has been replaced with what City analysts call a “treasure hunt” feel, as bargain hunters head to its stores for cheap essentials such as breakfast cereal, washing-up liquid and dog food – and to be tempted into bigger purchases such as beds and garden sheds.
Simon, 51, is the eldest of three brothers, and as B&M chief executive he is the reluctant public face of the listed company who shuns the limelight as much as possible. For more than 20 years he has worked closely with Bobby – the brothers are said to live next door to each other – who is the group’s trading director. Their younger sibling, Robin, is also a director but has not been involved to the same extent.
“There’s a Punjabi saying from our childhood that we both believe in: ‘One plus one equals 11’,” Simon has said of the relationship. “Bobby has been shoulder to shoulder with me throughout my business career, and I do believe we have both been more effective by virtue of that relationship.” Before hitting the big time with B&M, the brothers, who grew up in Sale, Manchester, had already enjoyed success. In the 1990s they established a successful wholesale business, Orient Sourcing, which imported cheap homewares for high street chains, eventually selling it for £30m. Simon has described his background as the “classic immigrant story”. His late father’s family arrived “almost penniless” in New Delhi after partition with his grandmother selling her wedding bangles so they could afford to open a shop. His father emigrated to the UK in the 1960s with “£10 in his pocket” and went on to set up several businesses and “what money he made he spent on educating his kids”, Simon told one interviewer. “He also loved talking to his sons about business and commerce, and he filled us with ambition and self-confidence.” Simon and Bobby chose different paths. Simon studied law at Cambridge and his early career included a stint at the management consultancy McKinsey. Bobby, on the other hand, went straight into the family cash-and-carry business after school. “We like to keep it simple,” Simon has said of the B&M formula for success. “We sell name brands that our customers recognise; we have direct sourcing, so there’s no middleman; and we have good retail standards.” Simon also credits some of his success to what his wife Shalni – a successful businesswoman in her own right – calls an “excessive dose of paranoia”. “I spend my working day, and indeed my sleeping hours, worrying that something’s going to go wrong.” The worrying seems to have paid off and B&M, which was founded in Blackpool in the late 1970s by Malcolm Billington, means the Aroras are far from penniless these days. The brothers sold a stake to private equity investors for more than £500m in 2012 before listing on the Stock Exchange in 2014, when the family shared an initial £1bn payout. The company’s success during the pandemic has pushed the share price to a record high of 533.6p this year, boosting the value of the family’s combined stake to about £1bn. They have also pocketed £100m in dividends during the past 12 months."

2021-01-07T15:08:29Z,business,Business,O'Neill's and Harvester owner considers emergency cash call,"The pub and restaurant group Mitchells & Butlers (M&B), which owns pub chains including O’Neill’s and restaurant brands such as Harvester, has said it may ask investors for emergency funds to help it survive an “extremely uncertain” future, as enforced closures have left it less than three months away from running out of cash. In the latest evidence of the havoc the coronavirus pandemic has wrought on the hospitality sector, the group, which also runs All Bar One, Toby Carvery and Miller & Carter, said all its venues had been shut since 30 December. The complete loss of trading – under tough lockdown rules set to last until mid-February in England – has escalated its woes after a dismal three-month trading period that ended on 26 November. Multiple closures due to coronavirus restrictions sent overall sales down 67% during that quarter. Even those pubs, bars and restaurants that were able to stay open reported revenues down 30%. M&B has cut costs and reduced spending but said it had only £125m cash left, having drawn on all its lending facilities. The business is burning through up to £40m per month and also has a £50m quarterly debt repayment due to go out on 15 March. With a cash crunch looming, M&B said it was likely to issue new stock and ask investors to buy it. Its shares fell 7% in early trading, because equity raisings dilute the value of existing stock. “We welcome recent positive news on vaccine approval and rollout but the future facing the hospitality sector remains extremely uncertain,” M&B said in a statement. “It is not possible to estimate with any confidence what restrictions on our ability to trade lie ahead of us and for how long. As a result, the directors believe it is prudent to explore an equity capital raise, to give the group increased financial and operational flexibility.” The plan has the backing of M&B’s largest shareholders. The billionaire Joe Lewis, who is also the majority owner of Tottenham Hotspur football club, and the horse-racing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier own just over 50% of the company between them. But directors have not decided when to launch the cash call or how much will be needed, the company said. “We are now in a third national lockdown,” said the chief executive, Phil Urban. “I am consistently impressed by the resilience and energy of our teams as we repeatedly open and close businesses that we have invested in to make [them] Covid secure and urge the government to better understand the huge impact these restrictions are having on the hospitality sector.
“The job retention scheme is temporarily protecting some employment but there is a real and pressing need for support for businesses themselves if we are to return to being the vibrant sector and important employers that we were.” Analysts at stockbroker Jefferies said it was “no great surprise” that M&B wanted to raise funds, given that companies such as Wagamama-owner the Restaurant Group and Whitbread, which owns Premier Inn hotels and Beefeater Restaurants, have also raised new funds. “Longer term, with a mainly-freehold, well-invested estate, M&B looks well-placed to capture market share from a damaged hospitality sector,” said analyst James Wheatcroft."
2021-01-07T14:00:10Z,business,Business,'I'm sleeping in my car': US states fail to provide unemployment help amid pandemic,"Eugene Williams of Daytona Beach, Florida, lost his job with a restaurant food distributor when the pandemic hit in March 2020, and had been receiving unemployment benefits without issue until June, when he accidentally entered “return to work” in verifying his weekly benefits claim. In doing so, Williams has been unable to restart his unemployment benefits for over 30 weeks, and repeated inquiries to the Florida department of employment opportunity have yet to resolve the issue. Like millions of Americans Williams’ life has been upended by an unemployment system unable to cope with the horrifying volume of claims it has received since the start of the pandemic. On Thursday another 787,000 claims for unemployment were filed in the US, more than the population of city of Seattle. The four-week average of claims is now 818,750, about four times more than the pre-pandemic average. “I’m sleeping in my car and in the next few weeks I’ll be without a phone,” said Williams. He’s been unable to find new work and has relied on charitable organizations for food. “It is impossible to get a hold of the unemployment department. The call center whom they say that they are working for the DEO but cannot contact them nor do they have an extension or direct line, all I’m hearing is ‘be patient.’ Isn’t 31 weeks patient enough?” Since the coronavirus pandemic hit the US, millions of Americans who have filed for unemployment benefits have faced long backlogs and errors that have delayed or suddenly halted their benefits. Nearly every state in the US has failed to meet federal standards in getting unemployment benefits to 87% of recipients within three weeks. About 14 million Americans experienced their unemployment benefits expiring on or before 26 December, as Trump delayed signing a coronavirus relief bill into law until 27 December. With benefits having expired for millions, some state unemployment agencies are likely to lag at least a week to restart benefits for those whose benefits had already expired. According to the Economic Policy Institute, 25.7 million workers in the US remain officially unemployed, otherwise out of work due to the pandemic, or have experienced a reduction in work hours or pay. Fifi Mata of Phoenix, Arizona worked as a donor care and data management assistant for a non-profit before she was furloughed in May 2020 after their health issues began to worsen. Mata, who suffers from liver disease and chronic bronchitis, already experienced a lapse in receiving unemployment benefits from their last day of work on 29 May to mid-August before a clerical error was fixed. “I went through my savings, and had to get financial assistance from the Salvation Army, and family members to pay my bills,” Mata said. The backpay they received went toward paying family members back, credit card debt, and catching back up on bills. “The additional $600 ended soon after I began receiving my weekly benefit, and I went back to barely making ends meet.” Joe Biden has pledged to act and now that Democrats have taken control of the Senate he will have more power to make changes. But for many the changing political landscape may come too late. In Wenatchee, Washington, Kimberly Glenn was working at a local hospital as a junior dietitian through the pandemic, though her hours were reduced and she was obtaining partial unemployment benefits through a work-share program to avoid furloughs and layoffs. In September 2020, she was laid off and has struggled to obtain full unemployment benefits, with her claim still in adjudication and call representatives unable to provide any solutions when she can get through to the call hotline. “I’m in limbo. I’m uncertain of the status of my initial claim,” Glenn said. She currently has $0.60 in her bank account and no income. What savings she had was wiped out shortly after losing her job. She took out a loan from a family member to pay her rent last month, and is trying to find some assistance to pay this month’s rent as her landlord has informed her of plans to file for eviction as soon as the law permits. The current federal eviction moratorium was extended until 31 January, though many evictions have been carried out around the US regardless. Facing homelessness, Glenn described the experience of previously recovering from being homeless and how expensive it is to finally obtain housing, afford a security deposit, first and last month’s rent, to be able to pay the security deposit for utility bills, and begin to rebuild credit. “I thought I was good. I was told I was good. This apartment, this admittedly tiny, unventilated, no-stove apartment in the basement of a house that filled me with so much excitement and personal pride just months ago is going to be one more thing that I couldn’t figure out how to hold on to,” Glenn added. “All of the decorations I put up make me sad to look at. For some reason I decided I liked pineapples in this place. Silly, cheerful, happy yellow pineapples are everywhere I look, but I can’t smile at them any more. They make me feel stupid. They make me feel like the world’s biggest chump. Honestly, I kind of want to just pack it all away and report to the homeless shelter already.”"
2021-01-07T13:53:15Z,business,Business,"Consumer finances at risk as 4,000 City firms face collapse in Covid crisis","About 4,000 City firms are at a heightened risk of failure due to the Covid crisis, and nearly a third of those businesses could potentially harm consumers if they collapsed, the financial watchdog has warned. A Financial Conduct Authority survey designed to gauge the financial resilience of nearly 23,000 regulated firms showed that the financial stresses caused by the first wave of the outbreak may cause “significant numbers of firms to fail over the next 12 months”, unless the UK economy starts to recover. The regulator said insurance intermediaries and brokers, payments and electronic money firms, and investment management companies experienced the largest drop in cash and assets, which can act as a buffer during a downturn. Sheldon Mills, the FCA’s executive director in charge of consumers and competition, said the situation was “unprecedented – and rapidly evolving”. “A market downturn driven by the pandemic risks significant numbers of firms failing. At the end of October we’ve identified there are 4,000 financial services firms with low financial resilience and at heightened risk of failure, though many will be able to bolster their resilience as and when economic conditions improve,” Mills said. “These are predominantly small and medium-sized firms and approximately 30% have the potential to cause harm in failure,” he added. Nearly 60% of all firms surveyed said they expected the Covid crisis to hurt their income, with nearly 700 firms forecasting it would fall by more than two-thirds due to the pandemic. The FCA explained that disorderly failures could hurt consumers, for example by reducing competition, as well as harming “the effectiveness of markets, and overall confidence in the UK’s financial system”. The survey included insurance agents and brokers, the investment management sector, retail lenders, crowdfunders, debt collectors and high-cost loan providers, as well as wholesale financial market players like brokers and exchanges. The number of firms facing failure is much higher than originally estimated. In September, Britain’s financial watchdog warned that hundreds of small and medium-sized firms could collapse due to the economic pressures sparked by the Covid pandemic.
However, the FCA cautioned that the survey results were collected before the approval and rollout of Covid vaccines, the extension of the government’s furlough scheme to 30 April, or fresh lockdown measures. The latest survey excludes the UK’s 1,500 largest financial firms, which are monitored by the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority. But the FCA would still be under pressure to prove it did its best to protect investors affected by any company failures in light of the scathing reports into its handling of London Capital and Finance ahead of the firm’s collapse. Last month, an independent inquiry found that the FCA failed to properly supervise the mini-bond provider, which wiped out the savings of thousands of people after it went under in 2019."
2021-01-07T13:43:16Z,business,Business,Billionaire brothers behind B&M take £30m payout after Christmas boom,"The billionaire Arora brothers who own B&M have handed themselves a £30m payout after the fast-growing discount retailer reported booming sales in the run-up to Christmas. The latest payment follows a £44m payout to the brothers two months ago, and another big payout last spring, and means that in total they have received dividends worth almost £100m during the last 12 months. Simon Arora, B&M’s chief executive, and his brother Bobby will receive the latest sum as part of a £200m special dividend payment to shareholders. The pair own all the shares in Luxembourg-based SSA Investments, B&M’s biggest single shareholder, with 15% of the company. A third brother, Robin, owns a further 3% of the business and will get £6m. The huge payouts put the Aroras among the best-paid company leaders in Britain. The Sunday Times Rich List estimated their net wealth at £2.1bn last year. B&M, which sells items ranging from frozen foods to plants and homewares, has been one of the most prominent corporate beneficiaries of the coronavirus pandemic, as locked-down shoppers switched their spending to “essential” retailers that were allowed to remain open. The latest payout is the third dividend payment the retailer has made to shareholders during the last 12 months. In April it paid a £150m dividend after selling and leasing back a Bedford warehouse, while in November it gave shareholders more than £290m. B&M said on Thursday it would award 30,000 workers an extra week’s wages as a bonus. A spokesman declined to detail the exact size of the staff payment. Profits at the company could have been higher, but it last month bowed to public pressure to return £80m in business rates relief granted by the government to help companies through the pandemic. After it became clear that sales at essential retailers had surged, most major retailers belatedly returned the payouts. Other top investors who will receive the dividends included American investment houses Fidelity, Vanguard and Fiduciary Management.
The latest payout came as B&M continued its rapid growth. The chain does not sell online, meaning it has missed out on the soaring demand for home delivery of groceries and other retail products. However, it has benefited from the change in spending habits as shoppers eschewed the high street in favour of out-of-town stores to avoid crowds. B&M said like-for-like sales in UK stores surged by 21% in the three months to Boxing Day. Simon Arora said the latest lockdown meant there were uncertainties ahead, but added that he was confident in the retailer’s cheap prices and its focus on out-of-town locations."
2021-01-07T13:22:10Z,business,Business,National Express to suspend all UK services from Monday,"National Express is to suspend its entire network of coach services across the UK from Monday due to the latest Covid-19 travel restrictions. The company, a major provider of timetabled coach routes, said it would be halting all services until March. Chris Hardy, the managing director of National Express UK Coach, said: “We have been providing an important service for essential travel needs. However, with tighter restrictions and passenger numbers falling, it is no longer appropriate to do this.” All journeys until Sunday night will run as planned to ensure that no passengers making essential journeys are stranded, National Express said, while customers whose travel has been cancelled will be contacted for free rebooking or full refunds.
Hardy said there was a provisional restart date of 1 March in place but warned that could change: “As the vaccination programme is rolled out and government guidance changes, we will regularly review when we can restart services. “We will now make sure we are ready to get back behind the wheel as soon as the nation needs us again.” National Express suspended its coach operations for almost three months from April 2020 in the first lockdown. While local bus operations have been underwritten by a government bailout, which is giving operators assistance equivalent to lost revenue, intercity coach services have not had similar financial guarantees. Since the start of the pandemic National Express has launched a division called Transport Solutions to use its brand and coaches in the vastly changed market. The withdrawal of coach services comes as the Department for Transport and train operators consider which rail services will be withdrawn, with around 50% of the timetable likely to be suspended during the lockdown."
2021-01-07T12:28:57Z,business,Business,Sainsbury's reports strong Christmas sales as essential retailers gain,"Sainsbury’s has upgraded its profit expectations by £60m after surging sales of champagne, steaks and other luxury food drove stronger than expected sales over Christmas and new year. The UK’s second largest supermarket reported that like-for-like sales jumped by a stronger-than-expected 9.3% year-on-year during its Christmas period, from 1 November through to 2 January. Supermarkets have been one of the main beneficiaries of consumer spending during the coronavirus pandemic, as locked-down shoppers spent extra money on groceries that they would usually have spent in pubs, restaurants and cafes. The Bradford-based supermarket Morrisons on Tuesday reported a big sales increase, while the retail analysts Kantar said December was a record month for UK supermarkets. Despite soaring revenues, profits have been held back by significant extra costs involved in delivering social distancing measures and covering for self-isolating staff. Supermarkets have also expanded home delivery as online sales have boomed. Sainsbury’s said its online grocery sales had increased by 128% year-on-year in the 15 weeks to 2 January to make up 18% of sales over the Christmas period compared with about 7% a year ago. Sainsbury’s delivered 1.1m orders in the 10 days to Christmas, double the number of last year. Sainsbury’s raised its profit guidance, saying it now expected to make an underlying profit before tax of at least £330m in the financial year to March 2021 compared with £270m previously expected. It was the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 on Thursday, with shares gaining more than 4% in morning trading. Despite the upgrade, Sainsbury’s profits will be down 44% year-on-year because of higher costs and after the supermarket belatedly pledged to pay back £410m in business rates relief given by the government at the start of the pandemic. The relief had been given on the expectation that supermarkets and other retailers would struggle, but essential shops that remained open instead reported sales increase. Sainsbury’s, B&M and a host of other retailers only pledged to pay back the relief after a public outcry. Sainsbury’s said premium champagne sales rose by 52%, while party food under its “Taste the Difference” premium food brand increased by 11%. Mincemeat sales soared 24% as Britons turned to home baking to cope with lockdown boredom. Sales of turkey were down as more families bought alternatives such as lamb or beef to cater to smaller gatherings under government restrictions. The supermarket also reported a record number of steaks sold in the run-up to New Year’s Eve, as UK shoppers were mostly confined to their homes. Sales of general merchandise rose 6%, thanks to a strong performance in Argos outlets which has kept stores partially open to enable shoppers to pick up online orders. Even clothing sales rose – by 0.4% – despite widespread difficulties in the market as events were cancelled and many worked from home. Simon Roberts, Sainsbury’s chief executive, said the company was “dealing with a lot of change and uncertainty again” during England’s third national lockdown, when he said staff absences were likely to rise above about 8% at present. He said the government “frontline workers”, such as supermarket staff and teachers, should be among those prioritised for vaccination. “Priority should be given to those that need it first. Those on the frontline should be part of that when and if capability is available,” he said.
Roberts said that the end of Brexit transition had not led to problems with the flow of goods from Europe so far but there had been some problems in sending goods to Northern Ireland, where the group has had to supplement its own products with locally-sourced Spar items. He said the group was “working through administrative change”. Roberts cautioned that the flow of imports from Europe was low at present and would not be back up to normal levels until the third week of January, suggesting that any issues with new paperwork on imports from the EU might emerge then. Dr Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said it was “a quite fabulous trading update from Sainsbury’s. It is really is some decades since we have been able to make that statement.” He said not only sales were better than expected but also gross profit margins on general merchandise and clothing."
2021-01-07T12:11:27Z,business,Business,Ryanair expects 95% fall in passenger numbers until April,"Ryanair expects to lose 95% of its traffic in February and March, with few if any flights operating from the UK and Ireland, because of the latest Covid lockdowns and travel restrictions. The Dublin-based airline, which normally carries the most passengers in Europe, lambasted “brutal lockdowns” and called on the Irish government in particular to accelerate vaccinations. Ireland has banned incoming travel from Britain until Friday, and from Saturday is expected to require all international arrivals to provide a negative Covid-19 test from within the previous 72 hours to enter the country. The UK is considering a similar testing measure. Ryanair said it was again cutting its full-year traffic forecast by a further 5 million passengers to between 26 million and 30 million, at best below 20% of 2019 levels. It expects to fly fewer than 1.25 million passengers in January and 500,000 in February and March, when it would usuallyfly approximately 10 million a month. It said it would significantly cut flight schedules from 21 January so there would be few, if any, flights to or from Ireland or the UK “until such time as these draconian travel restrictions are removed”. The carrier warned last week it would post its first annual loss since 2009, when the financial crisis struck. It said the cancellations would not further affect its results as the flights would have been largely loss-making. Ryanair urged the Irish and UK governments to accelerate vaccination programmes, contrasting in particular Ireland’s current vaccination rate with other countries. An airline spokesperson said: “The WHO have previously confirmed that governments should do everything possible to avoid brutal lockdowns. Ireland’s Covid-19 travel restrictions are already the most stringent in Europe, and so these new flight restrictions are inexplicable and ineffective when Ireland continues to operate an open border between the Republic and the north of Ireland.” The World Health Organization’s guidance in fact states that lockdowns can slow Covid‑19 transmission and while it warns that “such measures disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups, including people in poverty, migrants, internally displaced people and refugees”, it says it recognises that “some countries have had no choice but to issue stay-at-home orders and other measures: and is “hopeful that countries will use targeted interventions where and when needed”. Ryanair added: “The fact that the Danish government, with a similar 5 million population, has already vaccinated 10 times more citizens than Ireland shows that emergency action is needed to speed Covid vaccinations in Ireland.” The Irish airline has been advertising flights while highlighting the availability of vaccines, calling on customers to “jab and go” – a campaign that drew more than 1,600 complaints, according to the Advertising Standards Authority, which is investigating.
Ryanair said all customers affected by further flight cancellations and restrictions would be emailed on Thursday to advise them of free rebooking or refunds. It has previously not offered to refund passengers when flights operated, regardless of lockdown rules. EasyJet, which carried most UK passengers pre-Covid, said on Monday it would be reviewing its schedules and probably operating only domestic and limited international flights while lockdown lasts. Meanwhile, the Hungarian airline Wizz Air said it was cancelling flights as a result of the latest lockdown. Capacity in January is expected to fall to 25% of 2020 levels from the 35% level it flew in December."
2021-01-07T12:00:07Z,business,Business,Millions of US small businesses have survived 2020 â€“ and they're crucial to economic growth | Gene Marks,"There’s been much attention paid to the thousands of small businesses that have been suffering as a result of the pandemic. Restaurants and fitness centers have seen their operations curtailed to the extent that many are simply shuttering their doors. Retail stores have seen their foot traffic all but disappear and those in the travel, events and arts industries have also seen their business dry up as people and business travelers stay at home. The new relief package passed at the end of the year includes targeted funding to help those businesses through another round of the paycheck protection program, tax incentives and special grants. That’s a good thing.
But there are millions of other small businesses in this country who have been profitable this year. They don’t need the kind of help that restaurateurs and retailers need. But their continued survival is absolutely critical for future job creation and economic growth. To address the needs of those businesses, an incentive has been provided in the new legislation: extraordinary debt payment forgiveness on both new and existing SBA Section 7(a) and 504 Microloans. How extraordinary? If your business has an existing SBA Section 7(a) or 504 Microloan you can receive up to eight months of forgiveness on both your principal and interest payments (three months plus an additional five months if you’re in a hard-hit industry such as food service and accommodation, arts, entertainment and recreation, education as well as laundry and personal care services) all capped at $9,000 per month. If your business gets approved for a new Section 7(a) or 504 Microloan before 20 September 2021 you get your first six months of principal and interest payments forgiven up to $9,000 per month. You can even take advantage of this benefit if you’ve received a paycheck protection program loan. These loans aren’t for survival. They’re for expansion. “It’s an opportunity to provide fast, automatic targeted relief to SBA loan holders,” Senator Chris Coons, one of the architects of the provision, told me in a recent podcast interview. “It’ll help sustain or revive businesses that have really had a hard time getting through this pandemic and the recession that resulted.” The Section 7(a) and 504 Microloans are given out through the SBA’s lending network to small businesses with less than 500 employees and who meet other requirements. The businesses that receive these loans aren’t normally startups and they’re usually not struggling. That’s because – even though the loans are backed by the US government – a business seeking the financing must go through the similar due diligence like any other loan and produce tax returns, collateral, historical financial statements and other documentation that supports their ability to pay back the loan. But once those requirements are met, the loans – which can be up to $5m and at both variable and fixed interest rates – can be used for working capital, equipment and real estate purchases and even to acquire another company’s assets. Depending on the loan, maturities range from 7-25 years. Some may argue that this legislation is giving help to profitable small businesses that don’t need it as much and there’s some truth to that. But these SBA programs are not just for relief. They’re designed for economic development and jobs. They provide needed funds to small businesses who might otherwise not have been able to receive a loan through a traditional bank arrangement. “One of the benefits of having debt relief that is automatic is that you’re targeting some assistance to businesses where you already know that they’re smaller,” Coons said. “They’re more likely to struggle, that they weren’t bankable without an SBA loan, but they have made it through a review and an underwriting process.” Coons believes that these businesses can succeed with this kind of help. And he’s right. The pandemic will end. The economy will recover. Unfortunately, many small businesses will not. But there are 30 million of us in this country and for those that do navigate their way through the recession, this type of government assistance will not only help us emerge, but grow."
2021-01-07T07:00:02Z,business,Business,British Gas workers to strike from Thursday after restructuring talks break down,"Thousands of British Gas engineers and call centre workers will down tools from Thursday as part of a national five-day strike in response to the energy giant’s “fire and rehire” plans. The GMB trade union called the strike after 89% of its 9,000 British Gas members voted in favour of industrial action following the breakdown of talks with executives at Britain’s biggest energy supplier last year. The union expects the majority of the 7,000 engineers and 2,000 call centre workers who are part of its membership to take part, but will limit picketing due to coronavirus restrictions. The strike marks the end of months of tense negotiations between union representatives and energy company executives over plans to reduce the workforce and shift employees on to new contracts. The union has accused Centrica, the embattled owner of British Gas, of “bullying” its 20,000 employees to accept worse employment contracts or lose their jobs as part of a so-called “fire and rehire” plan. The FTSE-listed company, which has lost more than three-quarters of its market value in the last five years, said it has asked all employees to sign up to new employment contracts to help simplify the business. A similar approach was proposed by British Airways last year, alongside staff cuts, but the airline dropped the controversial plans after negotiations with trade unions. Justin Bowden, GMB’s national secretary, said: “British Gas boss Chris O’Shea’s attempts to bully workers into accepting cuts to their pay and terms and conditions has provoked this inevitable outcome – massive disruption to customers in the depths of winter and a stain on the reputation of an historic company and brand.” About 7,000 frontline office workers represented by the Unison trade union accepted the energy company’s new terms last month, and 4,000 non-unionised staff also agreed to sign new contracts. A spokeswoman for Centrica said: “We’ve done everything we can with the GMB to avoid industrial action. “Whilst we’ve made great progress with our other unions, sadly the GMB leadership seems intent on causing disruption to customers during the coldest weekend of the year, amid a global health crisis and in the middle of a national lockdown.” The company said it has “strong contingency plans in place” and will “prioritise vulnerable households and emergencies”. British Gas has lost about 1 million customers in recent years due to fierce competition in the energy market from a string of cut-price energy supply startups. As a result, Centrica reported a £1bn loss for 2019 before scrapping its shareholder dividend and warning investors there would be a steep slump in revenues in 2020."
2021-01-06T19:36:35Z,business,Business,Veteran investor is right to question stock market exuberance,"Jeremy Grantham, a wise old investor with an excellent record in calling time on wild stock market exuberance, picked his moment well this week to warn that a “fully fledged epic bubble” had formed on Wall Street. On cue, world share prices hit all-time highs as investors seemingly looked beyond the pandemic and decided everything was about to go very right. Hopes for a Democratic clean sweep of US Congress were priced up before Senate election results in Georgia were even confirmed. The talk now is of great “reflation” trade – serious US government spending to stimulate economic growth, coupled with a pleasant level of inflation (but not enough to panic the Federal Reserve). Even the FTSE 100, the ugly duckling of international stock market indices during the pandemic and Brexit, joined the party. The UK’s blue-chip UK index rose 3.5%, or 230 points, on Wednesday as its previously unloved collection of banks and oil companies came into focus. Banks love the whiff of higher long-term interest rates; and life for the oil majors is easier with a barrel of Brent fetching more than $50. The FTSE 100 has gained an astonishing 20% since early November, just before Pfizer and BioNTech’s big vaccine announcement. So what’s Grantham’s complaint? The co-founder of the Boston-based investment manager GMO has a few: “Extreme overvaluation, explosive price increases, frenzied issuance, and hysterically speculative investor behaviour.” He likens the mood to the South Sea bubble, the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the turn-of-the-millennium dotcom mania. To be clear, Grantham’s eyes are mainly on US markets, and many of his examples of excess relate to US tech valuations, especially Tesla, and the boom in listings on Wall Street last year of “blank cheque” special acquisition companies. But his broad thesis should still be noted: it is that, counterintuitively, the broad rollout of vaccines may be the moment that investors are forced to rethink. “Market participants will breathe a sigh of relief, look around, and immediately realise that the economy is still in poor shape, stimulus will shortly be cut back with the end of the Covid crisis, and values are absurd,” he says. Put another way: “Great bull markets typically turn down when the market conditions are very favourable, just subtly less favourable than they were yesterday.” It’s a point of view – and clearly not the popular one currently. But Grantham is a serious student of markets. Investors’ tone does feel bizarrely excitable. Beware tales from Hipgnosis adviser’s musical youth “I bought my first Neil Young album aged seven,” said Merck Mercuriadis, as music publisher Hipgnosis, the FTSE 250 royalty fund he advises, bought 50% of the songwriter’s back catalogue. He had a similar line on Monday when Hipgnosis acquired the super-producer Jimmy Iovine’s catalogue of worldwide producer royalties. Mercuriadis said he noticed Iovine’s prolific output “while barely in my teens”. These charming tales tend to obscure the complete absence of financial details in Hipgnosis’s deal-making announcements. How much is the fund paying Young? Investors are not allowed to know because the great man doesn’t want to say, apparently All one can deduce is that the price of royalties is generally rising. Hipgnosis’s “blended acquisition multiple” on its entire catalogue of rights, which now runs to about 60,000 songs, was 14.7 times “historical annual net income” at the last count in December. It used to be 12.8 times. At what point do prices become too frothy? A hard-headed commercial analysis might be useful for Hignosis’s investors rather than tales from Mercuriadis’s musical youth. He is, after all, planning to ask them for another £1bn to continue the acquisition spree – and, presumably, hoping to continue to collect the 0.8% annual advisory fee that goes to his privately owned management firm. New BBC chair’s links to Philip Green may raise eyebrows Richard Sharp, lined up by the government as the next chair of the BBC, is usually described as Rishi Sunak’s former boss when both men worked at Goldman Sachs. But having a future chancellor as an underling was hardly the most noteworthy moment of Sharp’s time at the US investment bank. Retail watchers will recall that Sharp, as head of Goldman’s European private equity fund, was the banker who was prepared to back Sir Philip Green’s attempt to buy Marks & Spencer in 2004. The bid was abandoned, but Sharp had agreed to bankroll Green’s takeover vehicle to the tune of £800m and sat at the table with him during negotiations. A past association with Green does not adorn a CV in the way that it once did, to put it mildly. How fortunate that Sunak’s brief spell at Goldman is now deemed more interesting."
2021-01-06T18:23:50Z,business,Business,FTSE 100 surges as City guru warns of stock market bubble risk,"Shares in London have closed at their highest level since late February as investors ignored record Covid-19 deaths and warnings from a veteran City guru that an epic bubble of Wall Street crash proportions was bound to burst. Stock markets around the world rose as optimism that mass vaccinations would ensure a rapid global economic recovery was strengthened by signs that the Democrats had won both vacant Senate seats in Georgia. With Joe Biden due to be installed as US president this month, news that the Democrats would control both houses of Congress boosted hopes of a bigger-than-expected US stimulus package. The FTSE 100 index closed 229.61 points higher at 6,841.86, after a rise of almost 3.5% that took it to within 800 points of its pre-crisis level. The rally was underpinned by a surge in oil prices, which made shares in energy companies more attractive, and by strong demand for shares in banks. By the London close, HSBC had posted a gain of 10%, Standard Chartered had risen 9% and Barclays was up 8%. Shares in mining companies were higher, with Glencore up 8% and Anglo American rising 6%. Saudi Arabia’s announcement that it was cutting crude production, coupled with a decline in US crude inventories, pushed the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil to almost $55 – its highest level since global financial markets were crashing in late February last year. In early trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up more than 500 points and was closing in on 31,000. The S&P 500 also hit a fresh high after a rising nearly 50 points in early trading. There were smaller gains in the tech-heavy Nasdaq amid concerns that Biden would introduce tougher regulation on Silicon Valley. “What investors are trying to figure out is how quickly the Democrats would be able to introduce their tax agenda if they take control of the Senate, and would they be more likely to act on regulation on big tech,” said Quincy Krosby, the chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. The optimistic mood on stock markets came despite evidence that record infection rates in the US were leading to a slowdown in the jobs market, and hints from ministers in the UK that the lockdown announced this week could last until at least March. Jeremy Grantham, the British co-founder of the US investment firm GMO, said in a letter to clients that current investor behaviour bore the hallmarks of the mood in the run-up to the 1929 Wall Street crash. “The long, long bull market since 2009 has finally matured into a fully fledged epic bubble,” the 82-year-old financier said.
“Featuring extreme overvaluation, explosive price increases, frenzied issuance, and hysterically speculative investor behaviour, I believe this event will be recorded as one of the great bubbles of financial history, right along with the South Sea bubble, 1929, and 2000.” Grantham, who is credited with calling the market peak in 2008, said the market posed great dangers for investors adding the US central bank, the US Federal Reserve, would be unable to prevent an eventual crash. “These great bubbles are where fortunes are made and lost – and where investors truly prove their mettle. For positioning a portfolio to avoid the worst pain of a major bubble breaking is likely the most difficult part,” he said. “Every career incentive in the industry and every fault of individual human psychology will work toward sucking investors in. But this bubble will burst in due time, no matter how hard the Fed tries to support it, with consequent damaging effects on the economy and on portfolios.” Grantham cited shares in the electric car maker as an example of the market bubble. “As a model 3 owner, my personal favourite Tesla tidbit is that its market capitalisation, now over $600bn, amounts to over $1.25m per car sold each year versus $9,000 per car for General Motors. What has 1929 got to equal that?”"
2021-01-06T17:37:41Z,business,Business,UK watchdog begins investigating Nvidia's $40bn takeover of Arm,"Britain’s competition watchdog has launched an investigation into the $40bn (£29.5bn) takeover of the UK-based chip designer Arm by the US company Nvidia. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has called for interested parties to submit views on the contentious deal before the launch of a formal investigation later this year. Arm Holdings, which employs 6,500 staff including 3,000 in the UK, is a global leader in designing chips for smartphones, computers and tablets. California-based Nvidia, a graphics chip specialist, announced its plan to buy the British tech group from Japan’s SoftBank in September.
SoftBank had acquired Arm for $32bn in 2016, when the Japanese company took advantage of the fall in value of the pound after the Brexit vote. Arm is based in Cambridge but has operations in a number of UK towns and cities, including Manchester, Belfast and Warwick. Its chief executive, Simon Segars, acknowledged at the time of the Nvidia deal that it could take up to 18 months to win approval from regulators around the world. On Wednesday, the chief executive of the CMA, Andrea Coscelli, said: “The chip technology industry is worth billions and critical to many of the products that we use most in our everyday lives. We will work closely with other competition authorities around the world to carefully consider the impact of the deal and ensure that it doesn’t ultimately result in consumers facing more expensive or lower-quality products.” The CMA said it would examine the possible effect of the deal on competition in the UK and whether Arm had an “incentive to withdraw, raise prices or reduce the quality of its intellectual property licensing services to Nvidia’s rivals”. If the investigation finds that the deal breaches UK competition rules, the CMA’s powers include the authority to block the takeover.
In October, Hermann Hauser, the co-founder of Arm, wrote to the House of Commons foreign affairs committee arguing that if the deal was allowed to proceed, the combined business would become the next US tech monopoly alongside companies such as Google and Facebook. He has argued that because Nvidia is one of more than 500 users of Arm’s designs worldwide – which include Apple, Samsung and Qualcomm – becoming the Cambridge-based business’s parent company will destroy Arm’s “even-handed” model and ultimately kill the world-leading British tech company. Hauser also told the BBC last year the deal would be “an absolute disaster for Cambridge, the UK and Europe”, adding that Nvidia would inevitably decide to relocate Arm to the US, leading to lost jobs. Hauser has said the government should use its powers to prevent the takeover, but has also backed indefinite legally binding conditions as an alternative. These include a guarantee to keep Arm’s staff in Cambridge, Belfast, Manchester and Warwick, and a promise that Nvidia does not get preferential treatment on new versions of the designer’s chips. The shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, has also expressed concerns about the deal, and has called on the government to intervene to prevent parts of Arm from being moved out of the UK."
2021-01-06T16:20:41Z,business,Business,WeWork to take drastic action to survive Covid crisis after rapid expansion,"The office-sharing company WeWork has outlined drastic steps to survive the pandemic, after aggressive expansion left it with acres of expensive office space just as demand for communal working dived. Accounts filed at Companies House show that the UK subsidiary, WeWork International, racked up losses of £234m in 2019, after signing a flurry of new leases for buildings. They committed the company to making billions of pounds in future lease payments to commercial property landlords, but thanks to the coronavirus outbreak, income from the freelancers and small businesses to whom it sublets space has dried up. In a statement in its UK accounts, but applicable to its worldwide operations, WeWork said it “expects there will be a material impact on the global demand” for its services. The pandemic has made it harder to collect rents from existing customers and reduced demand from new ones, forcing the company to offer discounts. At the same time, it said, suppliers are tightening their credit terms. WeWork said it and its US parent company, WeWork Inc, had enough cash reserves to withstand the “near-term” uncertainty, but did not address the ramifications of any lasting shift towards remote working. In the short term, the company will cut costs by delaying the opening of new offices and putting investment in areas such as marketing and maintenance on hold.
But the most crucial factor in its future will be negotiations with commercial landlords, whom it hopes to persuade to defer or reduce rents in light of the pandemic. WeWork’s UK subsidiary had committed to more than £5bn of future lease payments as of the end of 2018, according to analysis by the Guardian at the time those accounts were released. Since then, it has increased the number of its UK premises from 39 to 58, indicating that its lease obligations have increased significantly. On a group-wide level, WeWork Inc has future lease commitments of close to $50bn, leaving it – not to mention its commercial property landlords – highly exposed to any permanent shift away from office working. Rather than countenance a long-term move towards working from home, the company said it was adapting to customers’ changing needs “as they consider a return to work in the coming months”. “These enhancements include implementing professional distancing standards, de-densifying common areas, and reconfiguring offices,” it said. WeWork’s expansion has been as volatile as it has been rapid, amid wildly fluctuating valuations and controversy surrounding its founder and former chief executive, Adam Neumann. The company was forced to abandon a $20bn float in September 2019 after investors balked at heavy losses and publicity around Neumann, including his decision to take $700m out of the company before the float. WeWork’s growth under Neumann was based on a leasing model that deferred the rents it owed to landlords in return for higher payments later on. But the failed float debacle – coupled with mounting losses – prompted its largest shareholder, Japan’s SoftBank, to weigh in with a financial rescue package. Despite cutting staff and cancelling expansion plans, WeWork has continued to lose money. The company was valued at $47bn at one stage before its cancelled listing, but SoftBank said it was worth just $2.9bn last year, with its founder and chief executive, Masayoshi Son, declaring his investment in the company “foolish”."
2021-01-06T15:31:44Z,business,Business,Greggs forecasts first annual loss after sales slump,"The Greggs bakery chain, famous for its steak bakes and vegan sausage rolls, has predicted it will crash to its first-ever annual loss as a result of the pandemic, and it does not expect profits to recover until 2022. The chain’s annual sales slumped by more than £300m year on year in 2020, pushing it to forecast a £15m full-year loss, as coronavirus restrictions closed its shops and hit revenues. The company said it did not expect to return to pre-Covid levels of profit until next year at the earliest.
It would be the first annual loss for the retailer since it listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1984 and the group’s chief executive, Roger Whiteside, said he believed it would be the company’s first slump into the red in more than 80 years of existence. The company, which has more than 2,000 outlets in the UK, reported sales of £811m for the 53 weeks to 2 January, a 30% decline on the £1.16bn figure for 2019. However, despite taking a financial battering in 2020, the company said it still planned to open 100 more stores this year. Greggs said its fourth-quarter sales averaged 81% of the equivalent 2019 level, an improvement on the 71.2% achieved in the previous quarter, while it had to manage variable trading conditions across the UK. Whiteside said the impact of Covid-19 had been “enormous” but the retailer had changed its working practices to allow it to provide takeaway food under different levels of government coronavirus restrictions. Despite Greggs’ grim forecast for its full-year results, the firm’s shares jumped 8% on Wednesday, making the retailer the second biggest riser on the FTSE 250 index. Investors were encouraged by the news that Greggs’ sales recovered faster than expected when its stores were allowed to trade, combined with growing revenues from its home delivery service. Greggs announced plans to extend deliveries to a further 200 outlets, taking the total to 800, and also test a dinner menu for home delivery as well as opening the 100 new outlets this year. The company said it was taking advantage of cheap rents being offered by landlords, particularly in city centres and spots where people could park cars. Whiteside said the business wanted to open as many as outlets as possible in London, where it was underrepresented, including at major train stations. “There is no question that, largely because of Covid, city centres will be impacted over the long term and there will be less working in offices than before and less shopping as people have discovered that home working and internet shopping is convenient,” he added. “But it doesn’t mean city centres will be empty places ... history shows city centres as the driving force of any economy and so they will come back even if it is at a lower level.”
The pandemic also resulted in job losses at the bakery chain and Greggs confirmed it had made 820 staff redundant in 2020 as it looked to cut costs."

2021-01-06T14:16:26Z,business,Business,McDonald's pauses UK walk-in takeaways to review Covid strategy,"McDonald’s is temporarily suspending its walk-in takeaway service during the new coronavirus lockdown in England. The fast food chain said its dine-in and walk-in takeaway offering would not be available while it reassessed its procedures with an independent health and safety body. However the firm, which has about 1,300 outlets in the UK, said its restaurants would remain open for its drive-through and delivery services. Paul Pomroy, McDonald’s UK and Ireland chief executive, said: “This is a temporary change in our operations to allow us to test and validate any additional measures that may further enhance the safety of our takeaway service.” McDonald’s said it would update customers with any changes to its service via its website and app. Under the January restrictions, which constitute England’s toughest lockdown since March, all non-essential retail and hospitality must close or remain closed. Restaurants, pubs and other hospitality venues are not allowed to offer dining on the premises, but can continue to offer deliveries or takeaways. However, they are no longer allowed to serve takeaway or click and collect alcohol, amid concerns about people congregating around pubs and bars. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also in lockdown. Fast food chains including McDonald’s, Burger King and Nando’s initially closed during the first nationwide lockdown last spring, before introducing new safety measures and working practices, which allowed them to gradually reopen restaurants for takeaway, delivery and drive-through services. A spokesman for Burger King said takeaway was still available in some branches but “restaurants operating drive-through, takeaway, click and collect and delivery via Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat, will continue to operate these services, in line with guidance issued”.
Pret a Manger said it would keep some of its branches open for takeaway and delivery services, although some remain closed because of reduced footfall. A spokesperson for the coffee and sandwich chain said keeping 230 of its 389 UK branches open allowed it to “provide convenient access to freshly prepared food to communities and donate more meals to those who need it, with our charity partners”. The firm said it had reviewed its safety processes and believed it had “strong protocols in place to ensure our shops can safely remain open for both takeaway and delivery”. Pret shifted its business to focus on delivery in 2020 and said it had seen a significant increase in the use of delivery by customers since. Deliveroo said in response to the new restrictions it had launched mandatory contact-free delivery to customers, as well as mandatory contact-free pickup from restaurants. However, takeaways are permitted only until 11pm under the government restrictions."

The company’s UK division said it would offer two weeks’ paid leave for parents facing childcare emergencies because of the closure of primary and secondary schools across the country. Zurich estimates this will benefit more than one in five of its 4,500 UK employees who have children. The 10 days’ additional leave can be taken individually or consecutively. Employees who are struggling to juggle work and caring for elderly parents or other vulnerable family members are also entitled to take 10 days’ lockdown leave. Zurich said it was the first insurance firm in the UK to announce such a move, and could be the first company overall to do so.
Steve Collinson, Zurich’s head of HR, said: “With schools closed, working parents will be frantically trying to juggle their jobs and childcare responsibilities. We already offer flexibility for employees who want to change their working hours or structure some days differently. “But for parents trying to balance work, childcare and home schooling, this may not be enough. We’re helping our employees get through this crisis by offering mums and dads paid time-off so they can look after their health and their family. This is also available for anyone with other caring commitments.” Matt Potter, who works in IT for Zurich, said he was “very impressed with the offer”. He will ask his manager for the next five Fridays off to enable him to look after his two daughters, aged seven and nine, whose school closed on Tuesday. He and his wife work full-time and have been working from home near Southampton since the first lockdown in March. “We’ve got quite an issue here with trying to be teachers and looking after the children,” he said. Schools are closed until at least mid-February in England as part of its third Covid-19 lockdown, with pupils moving to online learning. Scotland has also embarked on another lockdown this week, and schools will remain shut until 1 February, while those in Wales are closed until at least 18 January. Schools in Northern Ireland have been told to remain shut for an unspecified period. On Wednesday, Boris Johnson said schools in England would be first to reopen when the lockdown lifts – but stressed he would be “extremely cautious” about when that could happen."
2021-01-06T12:58:58Z,business,Business,"Royal Mail ordered to pay £230,000 to harassed Hindu ex-worker","A former manager with Royal Mail has been awarded nearly £230,000 after a tribunal concluded he had been subjected to harassment and discrimination at work. Mathan Shunmugaraja, who is a Hindu, was called a “sly dog” by one colleague and was embroiled in a dispute with another over the use of a room in which he was mistaken for a Muslim. The tribunal also heard that after Shunmugaraja took time off work because of anxiety, one of his bosses threatened to stop his sick pay. Shunmugaraja, a maths graduate, was eventually dismissed. He unsuccessfully applied for dozens of other jobs but could not find work and has split his time between sofa-surfing in the UK and living in a rural part of India with his mother. The tribunal was told that Shunmugaraja described himself as being of British Indian origin, and as a Hindu. He began working for Royal Mail in Cardiff in August 2007 and by 2017 was earning £32,000 a year. The worker who in June 2017 called Shunmugaraja “a sly dog” claimed the slur did not have racial connotations but the tribunal accepted the term “dog” and the phrase “sly dog” would be perceived as an insult in many cultures and could have racial connotations. It said: “The tribunal finds it was reasonable for the claimant to be so offended, given that the term is regarded as being highly offensive in many cultures.” In his evidence, Shunmugaraja said what particularly upset him was that the comment had been made in front of his line manager but no further action was taken against the colleague. One of Shunmugaraja’s roles was to hold weekly training and planning meetings. He began using a space known as the “quiet room” that a Christian colleague used for praying. In August 2017 the colleague reacted angrily when he realised that Shunmugaraja was using it as a meeting room. He got Shunmugaraja’s religion wrong, saying he would not have used a Muslim prayer room for the meeting. The tribunal concluded this amounted to religious discrimination. Shunmugaraja described his dismissal in January 2018 as a “fall from grace”. He said he had considered his colleagues at Royal Mail as family. The tribunal said: “The claimant loved his job, was clearly performing at a very good level and had every expectation that he would continue to progress his career at Royal Mail until his retirement.” Royal Mail was ordered to pay £229,000, which includes compensation for lost and future earnings and for injury to feelings. A spokesperson said: “Royal Mail is disappointed by this decision. We are now carefully reviewing the findings. Royal Mail takes its equality and diversity obligations very seriously and is committed to a workplace free of discrimination and harassment, where our colleagues feel respected and able to thrive.”"
2021-01-06T06:01:19Z,business,Business,"Top UK bosses are paid 115 times more than average worker, analysis finds","Bosses of top British companies will have made more money by teatime on Wednesday than the average UK worker will earn in the entire year, according to an independent analysis of the vast gap in pay between chief executives and everyone else. The chief executives of FTSE 100 companies are paid a median average of £3.6m a year, which works out at 115 times the £31,461 collected by full-time UK workers on average, according to research by the High Pay Centre thinktank. On an hourly basis the bosses will have earned more by 5.30pm on Wednesday 6 January than the average worker will pick up across the whole of 2021. Warren Kenny, acting general secretary of the GMB union which represents more than 600,000 workers, said: “These repugnant figures expose the sheer scale of inequality and exploitation in the workplace. “The workers who have made heroic sacrifices to keep society together during the [coronavirus] outbreak deserve better – it is time for corporate leaders, shareholders and politicians to wake up and take action.” Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said the fact that bosses had earned so much money already “tells you everything you need to know about how unfair our economy is”.
“Our army of minimum wage workers – carers, shop assistants and delivery drivers – have kept the country going through the pandemic. Not these CEO’s at the top raking in far more than their share,” she said. “ If the government is serious about levelling up Britain, it needs to start by levelling up pay and conditions for those we most rely on, and stop the threat to freeze key workers’ pay.” Luke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre, which campaigns for executive pay restraint, said: “Pay for top CEOs today is about 120 times that of the typical UK worker. Estimates suggest it was around 50 times at the turn of the millennium or 20 times in the early 1980s.”
The online supermarket Ocado has been singled out as having the biggest pay gap between those at the top and those on the shop floor. Its chief executive, Tim Steiner, was paid £58.7m in 2019 , which works out at 2,605 times the £22,500 paid to the online grocery delivery company’s staff on average. It means Steiner was paid about 10 times as much as the average Ocado worker’s annual salary for just one day’s work.
The High Pay Centre estimates that chief executive pay levels remained essentially flat in their analysis over the past year, while pay for UK workers had increased slightly. It means that CEOs have to work 34 hours of the year to surpass median earnings, rather than just 33 hours in 2020. The thinktank’s calculations assume “a highly demanding workload” for CEOs of 320 12-hour days of work a year. This equates to hourly pay of £941 an hour. It would take a worker on the full minimum wage rate of £8.72 an hour 212 years to earn the same as the average CEO earns in a year."
2021-01-05T20:09:40Z,business,Business,"Rishi Sunak, give business a long-term Covid plan now","Thanks for the latest £4.6bn support package, chancellor, but when will you be serving the main course? That was the gist of the business world’s response to Rishi Sunak’s announcement of grants for the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors. One could call the reply churlish, but companies’ demand for clarity – and soon – is entirely fair. Decisions on jobs and investment for the spring are being made now. If Sunak intends to extend the business rates holiday beyond March, or the furlough scheme beyond April, he needs to hurry up and make the announcement.
The chancellor did not definitively say the Treasury intends to say nothing until 3 March, but that was his strong hint. “We’ll have a budget in early March to take stock of our wider support and set out the next stage in our economic response,” he said. One can understand – up to a point – the Treasury’s desire to keep its options open. The length of the latest lockdown is unknown and the vaccination programme is in its infancy. The UK will borrow £400bn this financial year, so it will feel pressing to ensure all support for business is actually needed. The Treasury does not want to accumulate “dead weight” costs. Yet delay carries a price. The modest grants offered in Tuesday’s measures are unlikely to change calculations for many small pubs, restaurants or events companies. Faced with a new lockdown, they will be asking whether it is worth trying to hang on until the spring if rates relief and furlough support could disappear in March and April. At the start of the pandemic, Sunak won praise for acting swiftly: the economic plan was aligned with the healthcare response. One can not say the same about subsequent Treasury decisions, most of which have gone down to the wire. The effect is to create additional financial uncertainties for business, on top of the obvious trading uncertainties created by the pandemic. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, put it well: “The government must move away from this drip-feed approach and set out a long-term plan that allows all businesses of all shapes and sizes to plan, and ultimately survive.” A budget in two months’ time is too long to wait. Next up: a V-shaped recovery
Still, at the top end of the business world, there are striking examples of what self help can achieve, with the clothing retailer Next producing two remarkable forecasts on Tuesday. First, despite Next having wondered at the start of the pandemic whether losses could be on the cards this year, its chief executive, Simon Wolfson, now expects pre-tax profits of £342m in the 12-month trading period that closes at the end of January. Then he expects profits in the financial year to January 2022 to rebound to £670m on a “central planning scenario” – only £60m less than in the last full pre-pandemic trading year.
Sadly, it is dangerous to read too many wider lessons into Next’s experience. For starters, the company’s online operation, even in normal times, generates about half the sales; therefore, in the nine weeks before Christmas, gains through the internet compensated for almost all the sales lost in stores. As important, Next is simply better than most competitors in managing costs. But one factor should give hope to all retailers who make it to the post-vaccination world: defaults in Next’s credit business have been low and those consumers who have kept their jobs seem inclined to spend when they have the chance. Few retail recoveries will match Next’s V-shaped profile, but most rivals would settle for V-ish. Is bitcoin a tulip bulb fraud – or pure gold?
Here is a brave prediction by a team of analysts at JP Morgan, the Wall Street bank: a unit of bitcoin, which has already risen fourfold to more than $30,000 in the past year, could eventually hit $146,000 if investors come to view the digital currency as an alternative to gold.
Any wacky forecast can seem plausible in the wild climate for bitcoin, but the bravery of this punt lies in the view of Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan’s chairman and chief executive. The boss’s analysis was famously straightforward: bitcoin is a “fraud … worse than tulip bulbs” and fit only for drug dealers, murderers and people living in North Korea, he said back in 2017. One admires the analysts’ independence of mind. And one wishes them luck with their careers at JP Morgan if their prediction soon looks ridiculous."

2021-01-05T19:03:33Z,business,Business,Rail services likely to be halved as lockdown hits UK travel sector,"Rail services in Britain are likely to be slashed by about 50% in the coming weeks, as a result of Covid travel restrictions, as airlines look to cut schedules and holiday firms cancel bookings for the coming months. The government is to consult with train operators over services to be removed from the schedule, as it seeks to cut the running costs of the now effectively nationalised railway. Rail firms expect that the rules introduced on Monday, which instruct people to stay home for work wherever possible and ban non-essential travel, will mean journeys fall back towards the levels of the first lockdown in 2020. At that time, passenger numbers were down to as little as 4% of pre-Covid levels and many trains ran effectively empty.
Train operators are also braced for staff falling sick or needing to self-isolate with Covid infection rising across the UK. No official figures for usage in 2021 are yet available for national rail, but Transport for London said tube journeys on Tuesday morning, the first peak hours under new lockdown rules, were 18% of pre-pandemic numbers, while bus journeys were at 30%. Both are so far significantly higher than the lowest weekday figures during the 2020 lockdowns (5% and 16%), possibly reflecting the broader exceptions for permitted travel for support bubbles. The Department for Transport said: “We will work with operators in the coming days to assess the right level of service provision as we have done throughout the pandemic. “While we cannot predict the long-term effect of Covid-19 on travel patterns, it is critical that we ensure the railway can respond quickly to changes in passenger demand whilst supporting economic recovery.” The shortfall in ticket revenue is mainly shouldered by the government under emergency recovery contracts agreed across the industry in October, and ministers are anxious to curtail costs that have already risen to £9bn in additional subsidy since franchises were replaced in March. Grand Central, which runs services between London and the north-east and still relies on fare income, on Tuesday suspended all its services throughout January and February. In the first lockdown, operators ran timetables roughly equivalent to Sunday services, about 55% of weekday levels, gradually restoring services through the autumn until 87% of trains ran, allowing for social distancing as passengers returned. Robert Nisbet, a director of industry body the Rail Delivery Group, said: “We are working closely with government to ensure we run the right level of services … By increasing cleaning and providing better customer information, our people are ensuring that those who must travel can do so with confidence.” Meanwhile, British Airways and EasyJet said they were reviewing their flight schedules. A BA spokesperson said: “Our focus is on keeping crucial air links open – transporting vital goods and ensuring people who are permitted to travel can continue to do so safely.” BA passengers whose flights are still operating can choose to accept a voucher or rebook, while customers of BA holidays travelling before 12 February will be refunded. EasyJet said it would reduce its schedules to UK domestic connections and a small number of international routes. It said all customers unable to travel as a result of the lockdown restrictions, whether the flights were cancelled or not, could rebook or obtain a refund. The airline renewed its calls on the Treasury for bespoke support for the sector, “such as has been provided to hospitality, where decisions have directly affected the ability to trade. The same principle should be applied to aviation.” Tour operator Tui said it was cancelling holidays departing before 31 January, and until mid-February from English airports. The company is contacting customers due to travel in departure date order to offer rebookings, vouchers or refunds. A TUI UK spokesperson said: “We will constantly review holiday cancellations in line with updated travel advice. Customers currently overseas can continue to enjoy their holidays as planned and we will update them directly if there are any changes to their holidays.” Thomas Cook also said it was calling all customers affected to offer rebookings or refunds. While Monday’s lockdown announcement will shape emergency timetables, the rail industry is increasingly resigned to seeing long-term cuts, with the decline in demand for commuter services expected to persist past the pandemic – particularly in the south-east, which forms a sizeable majority of UK rail journeys.
Labour said that the government needed to come up with a long-term plan to ensure that rail could recover. Shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon, said: “The government must ensure that transport services are being run in such a way that the essential workers using them, as well as staff, are kept safe.” But, he added: “Ministers cannot continue to shift the financial burden onto the taxpayer while guaranteeing private companies’ profits.” Rail unions demanded an industry-wide approach to manage the risks of the new Covid variant. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said the union’s priority was to protect‎ jobs, capacity and infrastructure: “We have to navigate the next few months whilst looking ahead to the crucial role rail will play in rebuilding our economic strength.”"
2021-01-05T17:35:56Z,business,Business,Cold snap forces UK electricity market prices to new high,"Plunging temperatures and a drop in wind turbine power generation have pushed UK electricity market prices to a new high and prompted the National Grid to put out an urgent call for suppliers to provide extra capacity. The National Grid control room warned that its spare electricity supplies would be “tight” this week, and on Tuesday issued an official call for generators to bring forward an extra 524 megawatts of electricity capacity within 24 hours. Electricity market prices have surged tenfold in a day to reach a new record high of £1,000 per megawatt hour, as colder than normal temperatures and lower electricity generation left a dent in Great Britain’s power supplies. The cold snap is forecast to drive energy demand to its highest level for this winter, while wind turbines come to a virtual standstill only weeks after setting a new generation record. The combination of high demand and low wind speeds has emerged as supplies from many traditional power plants remain out of action, causing electricity prices on the wholesale market to soar.
The electricity system operator, a branch of National Grid, said that although a warning notice can “sound quite serious”, it is “a routine way” to encourage generators to produce more electricity, and does not mean electricity supply is “at risk”. The National Grid control centre has issued a flurry of informal and official warnings this winter, which it expected to be one of the tightest winters for electricity supplies in the last four years. There were two official warnings on consecutive days in November, and another in December. Hartree Solutions, a merchant commodities trading business, said that the UK is “at much greater risk of blackouts this winter than the National Grid has forecast”, which is reflected in market prices.
The wholesale price of electricity to meet Wednesday’s peak demand, which will be in the hour from 4pm, climbed to £1,000 per megawatt on one of the UK’s most important electricity auction platforms, the highest price since the auction began in 2014 and 10 times the price for the same hour on Tuesday. Hartree said the shrinking electricity supply margins mean the National Grid control room “will need to be issuing alerts, warnings and utilising many – if not all – of their balancing tools on Wednesday to keep the lights on”. The official warning from the electricity system operator said: “In the short-term, we would like a greater safety cushion (margin) between power demand and available supply. It does not signal that blackouts are imminent or that there is not enough generation to meet current demand.”"
2021-01-05T17:35:22Z,business,Business,China's stock market closes at highest level since 2008 financial crisis,"China’s stock market has soared to its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis as the world’s second-largest economy mounts a rapid recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The CSI 300 index, which tracks the value of the biggest companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, closed up 1.9% on Tuesday at 5,368 points – the highest level since January 2008. Narrowly surpassing a level of 5,353 reached in 2015, when fears over a hard landing for China’s economy after years of blockbuster growth led to a sell-off in shares, the fresh landmark stands as the latest dramatic turnaround in global financial markets since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. It comes as China’s economy stages a faster recovery than expected at a time when other nations around the world are still grappling with rising infections and severe disruption to business and social life caused by the pandemic. As the nation at the centre of the initial Covid-19 outbreak, Chinese GDP fell for the first time in four decades in the opening months of 2020. However, many analysts believe harsh controls to contain the spread of the disease helped to lay the ground for a faster return to relative normality. China avoided the technical definition of a recession last year – two consecutive quarters of falling GDP – with a return to growth in the three months to June as it rolled back lockdown restrictions. After recording growth of just 1.9% for 2020 as a whole – the lowest level for 30 years – the International Monetary Fund expects China’s economy to grow by more than 8% in 2021, dramatically outpacing the recovery in many other countries. Nigel Green, the chief executive of deVere Group, an investment management firm, said the gains on the Chinese stock market reflected its rapid recovery. “China’s rebound is quite remarkable, compared to other major economies, many of which are once again rolling out stricter restrictions to stop the spread of Covid amid a tsunami of new cases.” “China’s already impressive economic recovery is likely to pick up momentum and this will be extremely attractive. But as 2020 showed us with perhaps too much clarity, things can change quickly and so-called ‘certainties’ can shift overnight,” he said. The fresh landmark for the Chinese stock market came on a day of choppy trading on the London stock market, with the FTSE 100 closing up 0.6% at 6,612, after recording modest losses earlier in the day amid concerns over the economic impact of the third Covid lockdown in England. There are however hopes for a stronger economic recovery in Britain once more people receive vaccinations, which could propel the blue-chip index higher. Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at the financial trading firm IG, said: “The swift nature of the vaccination process should ensure that any lockdown-fuelled weakness will be greeted by buying pressure as we look towards a March reopening.”"
2021-01-05T16:01:20Z,business,Business,World Bank calls for rapid action to prevent Covid debt crisis,"The World Bank has called for rapid and decisive action to prevent a new debt crisis as it said the Covid-19 pandemic could result in a decade of disappointment for the global economy. In its half-yearly health check, the Washington-based institution said the pandemic had led to the sharpest annual increase in government debt in more than 30 years, and had exposed the vulnerability of many emerging market and developing countries. David Malpass, the Bank’s president, said the biggest slump in the global economy since the 1930s had widened the gap between rich and poor and there was a risk it could take years for people at the bottom to see a sustained improvement in their lives. The bank’s Global Economic Prospects (GEP) report said there would be only a subdued recovery in 2021, with projected growth of 4% still leaving output 5% below its pre-crisis trend. It added, however, that there was a “material risk” that setbacks in containing the pandemic could lead to a much weaker rebound at a time when countries were faced with growing financial difficulties. Several countries had already defaulted on their debts and more were at risk of debt distress, the GEP said. Malpass said: “Already at record levels before the pandemic, both domestic and external debt burdens have become much heavier due to the devastating contraction in incomes across emerging market and developing economies.” A comprehensive set of policy interventions was needed to tackle what the bank called a fourth wave of debt, Malpass said. Similar episodes in the past had culminated in the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s and the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s. Efforts to come up with a comprehensive package to alleviate debt have been hampered by the unwillingness of private sector creditors and some countries – particularly China – to take part. Malpass said there was a need for greater participation by all private and official bilateral creditors along with deep debt reduction for countries in debt distress; better debt transparency practices that overcome secrecy and restrictions in debt contracts; and legislative reforms to speed up the restructuring of private sector debt. “The global community needs to act rapidly and forcefully to make sure the latest wave of debt does not end with debt crises in emerging market and developing economies, as has been the case previously,” the GEP said. “The pandemic has exacerbated existing debt-related risks and vulnerabilities.”
Shallower recessions in advanced economies and a stronger recovery in China meant the estimated 4.3% slump in global output in 2020 was slightly less severe than the World Bank feared six months ago. It added, however, that in addition to a heavy death toll, the pandemic had plunged millions into poverty and could depress incomes and activity for a prolonged period. “As with previous economic crises, the pandemic is expected to leave long-lasting adverse effects on global economic activity and per capita incomes. It is likely to steepen the slowdown in the growth of global potential output – the level of output the global economy can sustain at full employment and capacity utilisation – that had earlier been projected for the decade just begun. If history is any guide, unless there are substantial and effective reforms, the global economy is heading for a decade of disappointing growth outcomes.” Advanced economies were likely to experience a “slow and challenging recovery” as a result of new waves of infections, the Bank said. The US, the world’s biggest economy, was forecast to expand 3.5% in 2021, after an estimated 3.6% contraction in 2020, while the euro area was anticipated to grow 3.6% this year, following a 7.4% decline in 2020. China, which grew by 2% in 2020 was likely to expand by 7.9% this year, the bank said."
2021-01-05T15:54:23Z,business,Business,Rishi Sunak builds bridge to post-Covid UK – but will it stand up?,"Throughout the pandemic, bridge building has been a favourite metaphor of Rishi Sunak to describe his big-spending economic support packages. Billions of pounds have been spent in furlough wage subsidies, state-backed loans, business grants and tax cuts to carry the British people through the disruption. Now, faced with the fresh resurgence of the virus leading to lockdown 3.0 in England, yet another chasm in economic activity must be crossed. The chancellor knows a final push is needed, this time as the Covid vaccines raise hopes that the return to relative economic normality is tantalisingly close. With that in mind, firms in those sectors of the economy hardest hit by the new lockdown in England and tougher controls in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive a fresh support package worth £4.6bn, providing grants to companies to help keep them afloat until the spring. It takes the Treasury’s total support during the pandemic closer to £300bn for the current financial year. But what is hoped by Boris Johnson to be the “last phase of the struggle” against Covid-19 is – as the prime minister also recognises – the hardest phase. Analysts expect the latest measures will confirm a double-dip recession for the UK economy, with the US investment bank JPMorgan downgrading its forecast for the first three months of the year from 0.1% growth to a 2.5% decline in national output. It is not quite the scale of economic collapse created by the spring 2020 shutdown, when gross domestic product plunged by 25%. But the country’s current juncture is worrying because of the cumulative damage over the past nine months. Restrictions this time around are also expected to be tougher than during the relatively light-touch English lockdown 2.0 in November, when more non-essential shops were open and Britain’s manufacturing base received a pre-Brexit stockpiling boost. Schools have been ordered to close, hitting working parents and causing additional disruption, while more restrictions on movement will also combine to make January one of the most difficult months in the pandemic to get through. After almost a year of stop-start restrictions – and with a somewhat reluctant approach to offering fresh financial support on each occasion – businesses and workers across the country are seriously overstretched. And growing questions are being asked about the adequacy of Sunak’s bridge to prosperity. The early reaction from business leaders at the start of the latest lockdown is that any extra support is welcome, considering the mounting difficulties for companies after a difficult year. There are reasons to be hopeful. Unlike the unprecedented chaos of spring 2020 when there was no playbook to reach for, many firms are learning to adapt to life in the time of Covid. The hit to the economy is not expected to be as substantial, the government-backed loan schemes are already up and running, and furlough is a firm fixture of the business landscape – with a recent extension until the end of April. The extra support comes on top of this, buying Sunak time to build a more cohesive recovery plan to be unveiled at his spring budget on 3 March. But there are calls for the chancellor to be more ambitious today, rather than in 8 weeks’ time. Sunak notably stopped short of extending VAT cuts and a business rates holiday – two key demands of business groups – while there were also calls to extend furlough beyond April. These demands will inevitably grow louder. The powerful Commons Treasury committee warns that significant gaps in support that have existed throughout the pandemic, affecting millions of workers – not least the self-employed – urgently need to be plugged. And at a time of rapid growth in unemployment – with more than 2.6 million people expected to be out of work by the middle of this year – question marks still hang over the £20 per week uplift in universal credit benefit. This is due to be cut at the end of March, threatening to push more families into poverty. Given the scale of the accumulated problems after the toughest year for the economy in three centuries, and given the proximity of a return to relative normality with help from the vaccine, the chancellor’s bridge-building project appears far from complete."
2021-01-05T14:55:51Z,business,Business,Markets lose steam as UK businesses call for larger lockdown support package - as it happened,"Non-essential businesses have been forced to close across England and Scotland overnight after being plunged into new national lockdowns following a spike in Covid cases. Airlines have been cancelling UK flights in light of lockdown measures. And economists have been slashing near-term forecasts for UK GDP growth in Q1. After calls for extra support for business hard-hit by new restrictions, UK chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a Â£4.6bn package of aid comprised of: One-off top up grants for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses worth up to Â£9,000 per property to help businesses through to the spring A Â£594m discretionary fund also made available to support other impacted businesses via local authorities and devolved governments Despite some initial enthusiasm which seemed to lift UK domestic stocks on the FTSE 250 by as much as 1%, business leaders were quick to say that the limited support was not enough to keep firms going. Firms and lobby groups are now calling for an extension to VAT deferrals, tax relief, and a replacement to the government-backed bounce back loan programme to keep businesses afloat until restrictions are lifted. There were also concerns about supply chain businesses that may not have valuable enough physical premises to qualify for the grants. The British Chambers of Commerce said longer term measures covering the whole of 2021 are needed to help businesses invest and plan for the future. UK stocks were still the only bright spot across a sea of red in European equities, with the FTSE 100 up 0.1% and the FTSE 250 up 0.5% in mid-afternoon trading. The pound is up 0.1% versus the US dollar at $1.3595 and nearly flat against the euro at 1.1082. Meanwhile, retailers started reporting their Christmas trading figures: Strong demand for luxury Christmas favourites helped to drive an 8.5% rise in sales at Morrisons over the festive period Next also emerged as a winner from a tough Christmas period as sales transferred from shuttered stores to its website, but the fashion chain warned new lockdown measures would wipe out the extra profit it had made.

The company, which has 173 stores and concessions, has filed a notice to appoint administrators as it tries to put together a rescue. The legal document provides protection from creditors for 10 days. Paperchase was particularly vulnerable to the sales disruption caused by lockdowns in the run-up to Christmas as 40% of the chain’s annual sales are rung up in November and December. New restrictions mean all its UK stores are once again closed, in line with other non-essential retail outlets. A spokesman for Paperchase said the cumulative effect of multiple lockdowns, including the loss of crucial Christmas trade in November, had put “unbearable strain on retail businesses across the country”. Paperchase, he said, was not immune to the tough backdrop, despite strong online sales. “Out of lockdown we’ve traded well, but as the country faces further restrictions for some months to come, we have to find a sustainable future for Paperchase.” The spokesman added that the company was “working hard to find that solution” with the administration notice a “necessary part of this work”. The accountancy firm PwC has been lined up to handle the process. “This is not the situation we wanted to be in,” the Paperchase spokesman added. “Our team has been fantastic throughout this year and we cannot thank them enough for their support.” The company was founded in 1968 by art students Judith Cash and Eddie Pond, who opened a store in London’s Kensington. The company has changed hands numerous times, with high street rival WH Smith and now defunct US books giant Borders among the chain’s previous owners.
In 2010 the private equity firm Primary Capital backed a £20m management buyout from Borders. Primary Capital, which had also owned Yo Sushi and Coffee Nation, tried to sell Paperchase in 2014 and considered a stock market flotation two years later. In 2019 Paperchase used an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to cull unprofitable stores and cut rents. It blamed its financial problems on a decline in customer numbers coupled with rising costs. The CVA switched some of its stores to turnover-based rents, meaning the firm is not as burdened with property costs as some retail chains. The last set of accounts show the retailer making a loss of £11m on sales of £125m in the year to February 2019."
2021-01-05T13:23:36Z,business,Business,Hospitality sector unimpressed with Sunak's lockdown grant,"Pubs, restaurants and breweries in England have given a lukewarm reception to Rishi Sunak’s offer of grants of up to £9,000 to help them survive until the spring, warning the financial “sticking plaster” will not stave off closures in the long term. On the morning after the prime minister imposed a seven-week lockdown that will force hundreds of thousands of businesses across England to close, the chancellor announced a £4.6bn package of support for the retail, hospitality and leisure industries.
But with the hospitality sector on its knees, having been singled out for tough restrictions, industry figures called for a more comprehensive long-term plan, while craft breweries decried a lack of support for their previously thriving industry. “While this announcement is most welcome, make no mistake that this is only a sticking plaster for immediate ills,” said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the trade body UK Hospitality. “It is not enough to even cover the costs of many businesses and certainly will not underpin longer-term business viability for our sector.” More than half a million businesses across England will have to close due to the third lockdown, according to the real estate adviser Altus Group. Most are non-essential retailers that were previously able to trade but the number also includes 27,022 restaurants and 37,515 pubs, many of which have already been shut for extended periods, including the lucrative Christmas weeks.
Admiral Taverns boss Chris Jowsey, whose company leases premises to 1,000 publicans, said most would still be unable to cover their costs, with smaller venues particularly vulnerable. “It won’t be sufficient to stave off a lot of difficulties and closures,” he said. The grants, worth £277m across England’s pubs sector, are based on the “rateable value” of a premises, effectively the rent the site could command on the open market. Those with a rateable value above £51,000 – typically larger pubs such as big chain venues – can get the maximum £9,000 grant. Smaller venues with a rateable value of less than £15,000 – often community pubs that largely serve alcohol – are only eligible for £4,000. Jowsey said this amounted to about £1,000 a month if restrictions on opening stay in place until the end of March. Together with existing support worth £1,334 a month for smaller pubs, the combined package falls well short of the £3,000 he said smaller pubs needed just to keep their heads above water. “That’s got to cover everything, including living expenses and feeding their family,” said Jowsey. “It doesn’t leave anything for rent.” About two thirds of Admiral’s 1,000 pubs fall into the smaller venues category in terms of rateable value – less than £15,000 - and the company is charging them a maximum of £500 per month, about a third of what they would usually pay. Pub and beer trade bodies said extra support from the government provided a lifeline but would only bring short-term respite, with far more comprehensive measures needed in the long-term. British Beer and Pubs Association chief executive Emma McClarkin said: “Without this support, pubs across England were at real risk of being lost for good at the beginning of this year. “We had been anticipating permanent closures in the very short term without it.” She said their longer-term survival would required an extension of business rates relief and the cut to VAT on hospitality to 5%, which is due to expire at the end of March. She also called for a cut in beer duty. The real ale group Camra called for a long-term sector-specific support package to help pubs survive. “While one-off grant support is welcome, it is nowhere near enough to cover the haemorrhaging costs for pubs and breweries that don’t see any end in sight,” its chair, Nik Antona, said. Camra also backed the anger expressed by small breweries’ trade body Siba that pubs will not be allowed to serve takeaway beers during the lockdown.
Siba’s chief executive, James Calder, said craft breweries, which have not been eligible for much of the support available to the hospitality sector, had already lost 80% of their route to market due to the closure of pubs. “Sales through takeaway, click-and-collect and drive-through have enabled many to just about survive up to now,” he said. “This reversal in policy directly discriminates against small businesses while allowing supermarkets to continue to sell beer from global breweries.”"
2021-01-05T10:52:35Z,business,Business,Record month for UK supermarkets as Covid brings dinner back home,"December was the biggest month on record for British supermarkets as shoppers spent nearly £12bn stocking up on cheese, fresh fish and pork for a very unusual Christmas. Consumers spent £11.7bn on take-home groceries in the four weeks to 27 December, up from the previous record of just under £11bn in November, according to analysts at Kantar, as many pubs and restaurants were forced to close during the key trading period.
Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail at Kantar, said: “December is always an incredibly busy time for supermarkets, but take-home grocery shopping is usually supplemented by celebrations in restaurants, pubs and bars – with £4bn spent on food and drink, excluding alcohol, out of the home during the normal festive month. This year, almost all those meals were eaten at home and retailers stepped up monumentally to meet the surge in demand.” However, sales of whole turkeys slid 5% and Christmas pudding sales were flat year on year as most large family celebrations were called off under strict rules to control the spread of the Covid-19 virus. McKevitt said: “Without guests to host, it seems many families decided to pare things back slightly and the performance of traditional dinner items reflects this.” While total grocery sales rose 11.4% in the three months to 27 December, spending on Christmas staples was up just 4%, despite fewer opportunities to dine out. Sprouts remained popular with sales up more than 11% but other winners were cheese, with sales up 17%, fresh fish up 20% and pork roasting joints up 19%. Alcohol sales were up by £310m – as the closure of pubs and bars led to a switch to drinking at home. Monday 21 December was the busiest shopping day – earlier than the expected surge on 23 December – as households secured festive supplies amid the uncertainties of tiered lockdowns and problems at the Channel ports which disrupted deliveries of fruit and vegetables.
However, Morrisons was the only one of the big four supermarkets to gain market share as local independent stores, discounters Lidl and Iceland and online specialist Ocado all outperformed the major chains. Sales at independent stores rose by 17.4% while Iceland was by far the fastest growing chain among those with high street outlets with sales up by more than a fifth. Ocado’s sales rose 36.5% according to Kantar, more than three times the pace of Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda. That reflected a market-wide shift towards online shopping with 12.6% of grocery sales made via the internet in December compared with just 7.4% a year before. Aldi continued to lose market share with sales up 6.3% as it lost out to businesses with the capability to deliver online orders."
2021-01-05T10:49:43Z,business,Business,Morrisons sparkles with 8.5% rise in sales over festive period,"Strong demand for luxury Christmas favourites helped to drive an 8.5% rise in sales at Morrisons over the festive period, as the chain kicked off reporting on what is expected to be a bumper trading period for supermarkets. Morrisons said online sales had tripled and growth was boosted by strong demand for festive favourites such as champagne and salmon as families made the most of the quieter festivities during the pandemic. Sales in Morrisons established stores rose 7.3% in the nine weeks to 3 January but that was boosted by a 1.2% rise in wholesale sales via the retailer’s deal with Amazon and to supply convenience stores. The group delivered 35,000 of its new food boxes, which can be ordered by phone, in the two weeks before Christmas. The supermarket was the only one of the UK’s four largest chains to gain market share over Christmas, according to analysts at Kantar, as it cut prices and increased home deliveries. Morrisons said customer shopping patterns were different this year, as Covid restrictions prevented larger gatherings of friends and family. Champagne sales were up 64% compared with last year, while sales of whole salmon rose 40%. David Potts, the chief executive, said: “Customers were determined to have a good Christmas even if it was quieter than usual.” He said the company had “put its assets at the disposal of the country” and this would include three Morrisons stores hosting vaccination centres in their carparks from Monday. Potts said he had offered up another 37 sites for use if required. The chain said that despite the “extremely unpredictable current circumstances” it still expected profit for the current year to be in line with expectations. Morrisons profits are likely to be less than half the £420m to £440m once hoped for after it agreed to pay back £230m of the government’s business rates relief. The company said Covid-19 safety measures, including the cost of covering for vulnerable staff who must now shield at home, would also now rise by £10m to £280m under the latest lockdown rules. Nearly 7% of staff are currently off work, more than double the typical number for the time of year, because of the impact of test and trace, and the need to self-isolate or shield at home. Closing in-store cafes and lower fuel sales resulting from the government’s “stay at home” decree will hit profits by another £10m. However, the Covid-related hits to profit are largely expected to be offset by the benefit of higher sales as supermarkets pick up business resulting from the closure of restaurants, pubs and cafes. The chain has also spent £65m on preparing for the end of Brexit transition this month, including building up stocks of some items to prevent any shortages. Potts said about 81 product lines, including 22 types of red wine, canned fruit and pasta, were held up in Europe as some hauliers were refusing to travel to the UK because of concerns about the new variant of the Covid-19 virus and additional paperwork resulting from the end of Brexit transition. But Potts said he was “absolutely not” concerned and expected the goods to be delivered soon. “I don’t think there will be a shortage of red wine,” he said, pointing out that Morrisons sold more than 100 types of red wine. “We are ready for all circumstances,” he said.
He said it was too early to tell if there would be hold-ups at Channel ports after new rules on trading with the European Union came into force this month, as currently the volume of shipments was very low. Potts said his main effort to offset issues caused by Brexit would be in considering sourcing more products from the UK. Morrisons sources two-thirds of its goods in the UK and Potts wants to increase that further. “I’m going to be looking for British entrepreneurs starting a company despite the [difficult] time,” he said."
2021-01-05T10:05:10Z,business,Business,Where is Jack Ma? Chinese tycoon not seen since October,"Speculation is mounting over the whereabouts of the Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, who has not been seen or heard in public for more than two months. Ma, the co-founder and former chairman of the technology firm Alibaba, has fallen out of favour with China’s leadership. In late October, he stood alongside senior officials and delivered a blunt speech criticising national regulators, reportedly infuriating China’s president, Xi Jinping. In the following months, regulators summoned Ma and other executives in for questioning and halted what would have been the world’s biggest share offering of his company, Ant Group. They later launched anti-monopoly investigations into Alibaba and its key competitor TenCent, and called Ant Group in for questioning. In late December, regulators ordered Ma to pare down his empire.
Ma has not been heard from during the controversies. His last public appearance appears to have been at a livestreamed event on 31 October, an opening ceremony of the annual Chinese shopping event Double 11. In November, he reportedly did not appear in his role as a judge for the final episode of entrepreneurial game show Africa’s Business Heroes, which Alibaba has since blamed on a scheduling conflict. Ma was replaced with another Alibaba executive and his photo removed from the website. He also did not appear at this year’s Shanghai Zhejiang chamber of commerce meeting, where he has delivered a speech every year since 2016. Bloomberg reported Ma had been warned in early December not to leave the country. A hashtag “Ma Yun banned from leaving China” – referring to Ma’s Chinese name – was censored on Weibo, but his name was not publicly listed on a national database of people subject to such bans. Observers are being cautious in drawing any conclusions, with so little confirmed information. BBC cited an Alibaba employee saying that Ma often takes time off before the Chinese new year, in February. Martin Chorzempa, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Vice he would expect Ma to be laying low. “You don’t want to be in the public eye when your company is in a very complicated political situation.” Duncan Clark, the chairman of the Beijing-based tech consultancy BDA China, agreed Ma was likely avoiding the public eye. “This is a pretty unique situation, more linked to the sheer scale of Ant and the sensitivities over financial regulation,” he said. However, the various crackdowns on Ma’s empire have all been interpreted as China’s government reining in a businessman who was overstepping the mark, having become internationally renowned and unafraid to publicly criticise the Chinese Communist party (CCP) government. The CCP has since made it a priority to crack down on monopolistic practices.
When regulators halted Ant Group’s initial public offering, a People’s Daily editorial began resurfacing that said: “There is no so-called era of Ma Yun, only Ma Yun as part of the era.” Ma is not the first Chinese tycoon to face a government crackdown. In 2018, Wu Xiaohui, who founded Anbang insurance, was convicted of fraud and abuse of power, and sentenced to 18 years in prison. In March, the property tycoon Ren Zhiqiang went missing after writing an essay critical of China’s Covid response and appearing to call Xi a clown. In September he was sentenced to 18 years in jail for corruption. Bill Bishop, the author of the China-focused newsletter Sinocism, wrote that with Ma, “the party has once again reminded all private entrepreneurs that no matter how rich and successful you are it can pull the rug out from under your feet at any time”. Shares in Alibaba on the Hong Kong exchange fell 2.15% on Monday."
2021-01-05T08:35:10Z,business,Business,"Next's Christmas profits better than expected, buoyed by online sales","Next has emerged as a winner from a tough Christmas period as sales transferred from shuttered stores to its website, but the fashion chain warned new lockdown measures would wipe out the extra profit it had made. The retailer’s chief executive, Simon Wolfson, said the £28m of additional profit it had made from better than expected sales in November and December would be almost entirely cancelled out by the impact of shutdowns during the important Boxing Day sales period as well as new restrictions in England and Scotland which complete the closure of the 500 store chain. The new lockdown had seemed “inevitable”, said Wolfson, adding that while it was easy for people to feel angry with the government, the real culprit was the virus. “What I will be very disappointed by is if we don’t pull every lever to roll out the vaccine as quickly as possible,” he said. Investors reacted positively to Next’s Christmas trading update, pushing its share price up nearly 10% to more than £75 in early trading on Tuesday, close to the record high of £79.27 set in 2015. By midday Next’s share price was up more than 5% at £72.80 – still the best performer in the FTSE 100. By contrast, the worst performer was Associated British Foods (ABF), owner of Next’s high street rival Primark, which has no online sales operation. News of the new national lockdown in England pushed ABF shares down nearly 3% to about £21.60 by midday on Tuesday. Next said the pandemic was also delaying stock deliveries from Asia as there was a shortage of freight containers. “It is not getting it into the country that’s the problem; it’s getting it into a container at the other end,” Wolfson said. The retailer said many of its deliveries were running two to three weeks late, meaning stock levels were 10% lower than two years ago. All departments were being affected but it would be a much bigger problem if its stores were open, Wolfson said, with stock expected to “return to more normal levels by the end of March” “I don’t think if you went on to our site you would go, ‘My gosh there’s nothing here’,” said Wolfson. “On some of the best-selling lines we are thinking ‘We wish we had more of that’ but it’s on the water and should be with us in three weeks time. The stock problem and the store closure problem to a degree mitigate each other.” Sales in the nine weeks to 26 December were 1.1% lower than in 2019 – a far better outcome than the drop of 8% pencilled in by the company back in the autumm. While UK store sales tumbled 43% its online sales were up 36%. The company said the closure of about half its shops had limited its ability to clear discounted stock after Christmas. It would be able to clear about a quarter of it through its website; however, it would cost the company £5m more than selling it in its shops. The remainder will be sold in its outlet stores.
At the start of the Covid crisis, Next had predicted the pandemic would have a disastrous impact on its finances, but sales have held up better than it anticipated, boosted by demand for new home furnishings, loungewear and children’s clothing. Indeed Next is forecasting profits of £670m for the coming year despite assuming its stores will be closed in February and March, which would be within 10% of pre-pandemic levels. Wolfson also confirmed Next was part of a consortium bidding for some of the fashion brands owned by Sir Philip Green’s stricken Arcadia group but it would not take a majority stake in any deal. The Topshop and Topman owner went into administration in November putting 13,000 jobs at risk. “We are only interested in the brands that we think are very, very good,” said Wolfson. He suggested if the consortium won it would result in a similar set-up to the one struck for lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret, where Next operates the stores and website on its behalf. Next has proved itself to be one of the industry’s most resilient retailers. Its shares have recovered strongly from the collapse seen last year when the UK first went into lockdown. Years of investment in its home shopping business had enabled Next to weather the storm, said Richard Lim, chief executive of analysts Retail Economics. “These results are likely to set the tone for a polarised view of the retail sector which separates those with impressive online capabilities with those that do not.”"
2021-01-05T06:00:49Z,business,Business,'We see huge benefits': firms adopt four-day week in Covid crisis,"When Target Publishing cut staff pay after the first coronavirus lockdown last year, the magazine group knew it had to make a positive gesture to its employees. So it introduced a four-day week. “I felt better in myself that I was able to give something back to match the sacrifice everyone had made,” says Target’s founder and owner, David Cann. Faced with sliding advertising sales and several cancelled projects, the publisher of 20 titles including Natural Lifestyle and Health Food Business had cut pay for its 30 staff by 20%. But the shift to a four-day week brought immediate benefits for the Essex-based company. What surprised Cann was how much more effectively staff worked and that in July, when the situation had improved, he was able to reinstate everyone’s pay and retain the four-day week.
“Of course there were teething problems, but we found meetings were much shorter and we looked at the way staff worked and what they did much more closely to achieve significant efficiencies. “And from a mental health point of view, we see huge benefits and because everyone wants it to work, you get an upside in higher profits.” When Unilever said in November it would move staff in its New Zealand office to a four-day week on the same pay, the maker of Dove soap and Magnum ice-cream which employs more than 150,000 people worldwide, gave the kind of high-profile endorsement for flexible working that campaigners have been waiting for. “Its time has come,” says the economist Aidan Harper, who has championed the four-day week with colleagues at the New Economics Foundation (NEF) thinktank and a growing number of political organisations across Europe. Harper is the co-author of a new book, The Case for a Four-Day Week, that sets out the practical arguments for a reduction in the hours spent at work with no loss of pay. He said that during much of the 20th-century companies were forced, either by trade union action, government policy or labour shortages to give workers a large slice of the gains in productivity – the output of each worker per hour – but this ran out of steam in the 1980s. With productivity increases close to zero since the 2008 financial crash and the pandemic forcing companies like Target to rethink how they deploy their resources, there is a growing expectation that a broader shift to shorter working hours will happen in 2021. A recent report by the thinktank Autonomy argued that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, could prevent a steep rise in unemployment if he supported companies moving to a four-day week. It said a majority of 50,000 firms studied would be able to cope with the change through higher productivity or by raising prices. It urged the government to investigate ways of rolling out a four-day week, starting with the public sector. A few weeks after the Unilever announcement Awin, an online marketing firm, said its 1,000 employees – including more than 300 based in the UK – would move to a four-day week after trialling several forms of flexible working. Like Awin, Unilever will trust staff to work more effectively during a 12-month pilot project. This is not based on hope, but on analysis of how 81 white-collar workers in Auckland carry out their day-to-day tasks using the practical lessons from a local advisory firm Perpetual Guardian, itself a four-day week business run by Andrew Barnes, a former boss of £5.7bn turnover investment broker Bestinvest. Unilever will introduce new project management software to cut down on unnecessary tasks and support faster decision-making. After the trial, the company says it will evaluate the outcome with Sydney’s University of Technology business school and look at how a shorter working week could be adopted by the rest of its 155,000 employees globally. The initiative follows a similar trial by Microsoft in its Japanese operations and Toyota’s adoption of reduced hours in several of its factories.
Microsoft said in November that employees increased productivity by 40%, more than making up for the 20% drop in attendance by staff. The US tech firm restricted meetings to half an hour and changed many of its working practices as part of part of a summer project that allowed greater participation by staff teams. The company has yet to reveal what happens next. Until now the number of organisations taking the plunge is few and progress towards a widespread four-day week culture has so far been glacial, but Harper expects the pressure on companies to review their operations to accelerate take-up in the new year. “At its recent conference the Scottish National party called on the Scottish government to launch a review of working practices, including the possibility of a four-day week, while the recent Marmot review into health outcomes put shorter working hours on its list of priorities to cut stress and extend life expectancy,” he says. Julius Goldthorpe, the co-founder of the recruitment company Four Day Week, says the concept has been growing in popularity but remains a small part of the jobs market. “We started out wanting to focus just on jobs that were four days a week, but we were ahead of the curve and within six months had broadened out to take in all forms of flexible working,” he says. The supermarket chain Morrisons said in the summer it would be moving to a four-day week at its Bradford headquarters, though it is a more tentative move than the headline announcement suggests. There was a cut in weekly hours from 40 a week to 37.5 and the company said staff will work nine-hour days to cram the time into a four-day week with a six-hour shift on a Saturday once a month.
The resulting gain of 2.5 hours is less than the 4.2 hours the NEF believes UK workers should have received from productivity growth since 1980. Harper, like the economist Lord Skidelsky, who advised Labour’s former shadow chancellor John McDonnell to adopt shorter hours on a sector by sector basis – rather than a blanket approach - wants the government to swing behind the move to improve the UK’s low ranking among European countries. Full-time employees in the UK – which make up 74% of the workforce – work longer hours than full-time employees in all other EU countries except Greece and Austria. The EU average was 41.2 hours a week in 2018; the UK’s is 42.5. A four-day week would reduce those hours, but investment is also needed to ensure that productivity gains follow."
2021-01-05T00:01:42Z,business,Business,IFS calls for a fairer UK after Covid brings greater inequality,"A leading thinktank has called for action to make Britain a fairer country after its research showed that the Covid-19 pandemic had led to greater inequality. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the most vulnerable – those on lower incomes, the young, the least-educated and people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds – had been hit hardest by the crisis. Covid-19 has “cruelly exposed huge variations in how easily we are able to weather threats to livelihoods, to educational progress, to physical and mental health”, the IFS said. “These disparities have been closely correlated with pre-existing inequalities between groups according to their education, income, location and ethnicity – in ways that are often hard to disentangle, but depressingly familiar.” Eighteen months ago, the IFS launched a five-year study of inequality headed by the economics Nobel laureate Sir Angus Deaton. In a new year update, the thinktank said the pandemic had thrown up challenges that could not be ducked.
The report noted that: Mortality rates in the most deprived communities were about twice as high as those in the least deprived. BAME groups were more likely to die than the white majority, in part reflecting their occupations. The better-paid and more highly educated had found it easier to cope financially with the crisis. Among graduates, there had been a 7% fall in the number doing any paid work; among non-graduates it was 17%. Children from poorer families found it harder to do schoolwork during lockdown, received less online teaching, and have been more likely to miss school since September. Elderly people have suffered high mortality rates from Covid-19, but the young have felt the economic consequences, with the under-25s more than twice as likely as older workers to have lost their jobs.
The IFS said: “We need to do more to ensure greater economic opportunities for minority ethnic groups, and ensure that they are not consigned to low-paid and self-employed occupations. They would benefit disproportionately from policies that, for example, provided greater security for the self-employed and others in insecure work, improved pay and conditions in health and social care, and supported progress through the labour market.” The report also said that without targeted support for children who had fallen behind as a result of the crisis, the “huge educational inequalities that existed” before the pandemic were almost certain to get worse. The IFS said the risk of permanent scarring to the younger generation would be reduced if help was provided to school leavers and graduates looking for work and training. Asset prices had been bolstered by Bank of England action to support the economy, making it important for the Treasury to support the young and those without wealth. Deaton said: “As the vaccines should, at some point this year, take us into a world largely free of the pandemic, it is imperative to think about policies that will be needed to repair the damage and that focus on those who have suffered the most. We need to build a country in which everyone feels that they belong.”"
2021-01-04T20:49:54Z,business,Business,Top US business leaders call on Congress to certify election results,"Some of America’s top business leaders called on Congress to certify the electoral results for the president-elect, Joe Biden, in a letter Monday, arguing that “attempts to thwart or delay this process run counter to the essential tenets of our democracy”. The letter, signed by executives at American Express, Goldman Sachs, JetBlue, Microsoft, Pfizer and others, marks the US business community’s most public effort to date to push back against Donald Trump’s continuing attempts to overturn the election result.
Organized by the business advocacy group Partnership for New York City, the letter states: “The incoming Biden administration faces the urgent tasks of defeating Covid-19 and restoring the livelihoods of millions of Americans who have lost jobs and businesses during the pandemic. “Our duly elected leaders deserve the respect and bipartisan support of all Americans at a moment when we are dealing with the worst health and economic crises in modern history. There should be no further delay in the orderly transfer of power.” Many leaders in the business community initially embraced the Trump administration and Trump established a high powered jobs panel to revitalize the US economy. But many of those leaders quit after his apparent support for white supremacists after a fatal rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Among the signatories of Monday’s letter is Jonathan Gray, the chief operating officer of Blackstone, the private equity group run by Stephen Schwarzman, one of Trump’s biggest backers."
2021-01-04T19:37:51Z,business,Business,No need for Entain to rush into accepting MGM Resorts offer | Nils Pratley,"It feels surprising that the big beasts of the US gambling scene, Las Vegas casino companies, are such digital dunces that they require UK-listed companies to tell them how to run an online betting business. But a pattern has been established. Slick back-office technology, proved over years in Europe, is seen as critical to cracking the liberalising US betting market. Caesars Entertainment last year agreed a £2.9bn purchase of William Hill. US money is flowing into Flutter Entertainment, owner of PaddyPower and Betfair. Now MGM Resorts has bid £8.1bn for Entain, as GVC, owner of Ladbrokes and Coral, calls itself these days. Given that Entain’s shares went as low as 300p in the panicky Covid selloff last March, one might say it’s brave for the board to declare that £13.83 “significantly undervalues the company and its prospects”. After all, it’s no so long ago that GVC was a scrappy, Aim-listed operator that made a chunk of its money in high-risk unregulated markets (and HM Revenue & Customs is still investigating the processing of payments in a former Turkey division).
But, actually, rejecting MGM’s initial approach looks the correct response. Entain’s shares had recovered to £11.33 by the end of 2020 and a 22% takeover premium is miserable given the hype around the coming betting boom in the US as regulations there relax. Entain and MGM run a 50/50 joint venture in North America called BetMGM and, although it’s now small (annual revenues of $150m-ish), the potential for growth is what matters from a valuation perspective. Entain estimated the joint venture’s share of the market in relevant US states at 18% last November. If that ratio can be defended, and if the US betting market will eventually be worth $20bn (£14.8bn) to $30bn, as analysts suggest, you don’t surrender cheaply before the game has started properly. Jefferies analysts had put a £14.50 price target on Entain’s shares based on a 15% US market share. But, they added, one could also look at the lofty rating of DraftKings, a quoted US rival, and come up with £19.75. Either way, £13.83 is a long way short of being a compelling offer. Besides, since MGM is offering shares and only a “limited partial” cash alternative, the bidder is obliged to say something about its would-be strategy for a combined entity. How else are Entain’s investors, who would hold 41.5% of an enlarged MGM on even these inadequate terms, meant to assess what they’re being offered? For example: would the British betting shops, which look an odd fit with shiny Vegas casinos, be kept or sold? MGM, one assumes, will clarify such points if it proceeds to a formal bid. In the meantime, Entain’s board should continue to take a relaxed line. If the Americans want to pay over the odds today, fine. If they don’t, there’s little harm in making MGM wait to see how the US betting bonanza develops. A corporate marriage is probably on the cards eventually, but there’s no need for Entain to rush.
Ferguson sale of Wolseley UK is surely good news Wolseley used to be a big FTSE 100 name until the company decided in 2017 it would rather be called Ferguson, in honour of its large US building materials business. Now Wolseley UK, the domestic distributor of heating and plumbing products, is departing and the disposal price ain’t much to shout about – £308m for an operation with turnover of £1.4bn. The modest £6m of trading profit at the UK unit last year partly explains the lowly price. The abandonment of the original spinoff float plan also sent a weak price signal. And, in the midst of a pandemic, would-be trade buyers were probably thin on the ground. So the US private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice looks to have had an easy run at this deal; it’s even been able to force Ferguson to keep the associated defined pension liabilities. One can bemoan the arrival of opportunistic private equity money but, actually, it’s surely a good thing that somebody is prepared to take a punt that a cyclical UK business is still worth investing in. The board of Ferguson, with US activist investors on its tail demanding a purely North American company and a US listing, was never going to rise to that challenge."
2021-01-04T18:37:54Z,business,Business,FTSE 100 vaccine optimism tempered by prospect of full lockdown,"The FTSE 100 rose strongly on the first trading day of 2021, although optimism over the newly approved Oxford coronavirus vaccine was tempered by the prospect of tougher lockdown restrictions. The index of Britain’s biggest listed companies gained by more than 100 points, or about 1.7%, on Monday, to reach 6,571 after the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca was administered for the first time since its approval by the British medicines regulator last week. The index had leapt by almost 3% earlier in the day, but lost ground in the afternoon as England headed for tightened Covid restrictions to counter a resurgence in the pandemic. Wall Street also slipped, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling by more than 600 points in early trading in New York before Senate runoff elections in Georgia on Tuesday. The pound fell by almost 1% against the dollar on the global currency markets to trade at about $1.35. Weaker sterling can boost the FTSE 100 because many companies in the index generate the bulk of their earnings overseas.
Stock markets across Europe recorded modest gains as investors bet that a swift economic recovery would follow tougher government restrictions to staunch the growth in Covid-19 infections. Ending the day on a downbeat note after falling back from big gains earlier on Monday, France’s Cac 40 index closed up 0.7% and Germany’s Dax 30 by 0.1%. Analysts said a lack of widespread disruption for cross-border trade after the end of the Brexit transition had also buoyed markets. Truck movements are, however, below normal for the time of year, after firms rushed to move goods before the transition expired and a last-minute deal was agreed between the UK and the EU before the 31 December deadline. Tougher government restrictions and the rapid growth in coronavirus infections are however expected to hit the economy at the start of the year. Despite the gains for the FTSE 100 as a whole, shares in banks and housebuilders – which are more sensitive to the domestic hit from tougher Covid restrictions than more international firms in the index – fell sharply.
Hinesh Patel, a portfolio manager at the investment firm Quilter Investors, said the performance of the FTSE 100 was a reflection of investors desperately hoping that the vaccine could be rolled out quickly. “Otherwise they may find themselves prematurely embracing the reopening of the economy.” However, he added: “With Brexit risk appearing as if it is off the table and the start of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine rollout, many investors are taking the opportunity to catch up on some of the potential opportunities they may have missed prior to Christmas.”"
2021-01-04T17:56:46Z,business,Business,Aldi UK enjoys sparkling Christmas as champagne sales soar,"Aldi UK has reported a record Christmas performance, with sales rising 10.6% year-on-year in the four weeks to 24 December boosted by demand for premium products and champagne. All UK supermarket groups benefited in the run-up to Christmas from unprecedented demand due to the Covid-19 pandemic, driven by a large part of the population working from home and restrictions on cafe, pub and restaurant openings. Supermarkets also had more mouths to feed, with many of the 5 million or so Britons who normally travel abroad for Christmas staying in the UK. Aldi, Britain’s fifth largest supermarket group with an 8% market share, said its premium Specially Selected range had performed well, while it also reported strong demand for beers, wines and spirits, selling 4.5m bottles of champagne, sparkling wine and prosecco. The group highlighted particularly strong growth in its online wine and Specialbuy offering, with sales in December up 75% on the previous year. “We had a record Christmas with unprecedented demand for our award-winning products as customers pushed the boat out more than ever before,” said its CEO, Giles Hurley. The pandemic has prompted Aldi to accelerate its push into home delivery so it can benefit from a jump in demand that is expected to last. But unlike Britain’s other major supermarket groups it is continuing to open new stores. It has more than 900 and plans to open on average a new store every week as it targets 1,200 stores by 2025. Aldi UK also plans to spend an additional £3.5bn a year with British suppliers by 2025 as part of its expansion plans."
2021-01-04T15:24:00Z,business,Business,UK mortgage approvals at highest level in 13 years,"UK mortgage approvals have risen to the highest level in 13 years, driven by the government’s stamp duty holiday and buyers reassessing their living situation during the coronavirus pandemic. Figures from the Bank of England showed the number of mortgages approved by banks and building societies for home purchases had leapt to 105,000 in November – the highest figure since August 2007, the month immediately before queues formed outside branches of Northern Rock at the start of the financial crisis. Threadneedle Street said the number of monthly approvals had increased by 7,700 on October’s level, reflecting a boom in the mortgage market during the month when rapid growth in Covid infections led the government to impose a second national lockdown in England.
Mortgage borrowing plunged during the first Covid lockdown as the crisis sank Britain’s economy into the deepest recession for 300 years, hitting a trough of just £200m in April 2020. Borrowing soared to £5.7bn in November, up £1.2bn on the level in October. The number of new mortgage approvals – which provide an early indicator for borrowing levels in future months when buyers take up their mortgage offers – have increased more than tenfold, after hitting a low point of 9,400 in May. Figures from the Bank also showed households repaid £1.5bn of credit card debt, personal loans and car finance in November, in a reflection of weaker consumer spending during the second national lockdown and some households in which people work from home being able to save money. Since the start of the pandemic in March, households have repaid £17.3bn of consumer credit, according to the Bank, bucking a trend in recent years for rapid growth in credit-card borrowing. While many low-income workers have suffered a financial hit during the pandemic, total household deposits increased by almost £5bn on the month to reach £17.6bn, as people saved money while much of the high street was closed. Despite the boom in mortgage approvals – equivalent to the last days of the mid-2000s property bubble when zero-deposit mortgages were still widely available – analysts warn that a sharp drop in activity is looming. The UK housing market boomed in 2020, with property prices soaring to a six-year high as people rushed to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday and re-evaluated their living arrangements during lockdown. However, mortgage lenders and economists warn the end of the stamp duty holiday in March and rising unemployment could trigger a collapse in house prices in 2021. Halifax, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, estimates an annual drop of between 2% and 5%, while the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s economic forecaster, is more pessimistic, predicting an 8% fall. Faced with the potential downturn, lenders have made it tougher for buyers with smaller deposits to purchase a home – hitting first-time buyers. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said demanded looked set to remain strong right up until the starting threshold for paying stamp duty – the tax paid on property purchases – returns to £125,000, from £500,000 at present. “The mortgage market is heading for a hard landing,” he said.
House price growth is, however, expected to return in 2022, according to analysts, despite the cost of a home rising out of reach for increasing numbers of people in recent years. Tom Bill, the head of UK residential research at the estate agents Knight Frank, said: “While the end of the stamp duty holiday in March will clearly have an impact on transaction numbers, the effect will be reduced if the pandemic has entered the endgame. Some buyers and sellers may hesitate in coming weeks, but sentiment will ultimately improve over the course of the year.”"
2021-01-04T15:07:23Z,business,Business,Markets boosted as Oxford vaccine rollout begins – business live,"Markets across Europe rose on the first trading day of 2021, despite the threat of tougher lockdowns. The distribution of Covid vaccines including the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab from Monday raised hopes that a recovery was in sight. The FTSE 100 jumped nearly 3%, making it the largest riser among its European peers. Entain shares surged 28% and led the blue chip index after the owner of the Ladbrokes and Coral betting brands said Â£8bn takeover bid from its US joint venture partner MGM Resorts International significantly undervalued the business. UK stocks continued to rise even after Scotland announced a national lockdown, and Boris Johnson was widely expected to follow suit in a national address this evening On Wall Street, S&P 500 and Dow hit record highs at the open before quickly turning into negative territory Bitcoin prices fell sharply this morning, dropping by around $4,000 from the record peak it hit on Sunday. The raft of manufacturing PMI data released today showed: Eurozone manufacturing PMI rose to 55.2 in December from 53.8 in November, its highest level since May 2018. UK manufacturing activity rose to its highest level since November 2017 last month, hitting 57.5 in December compared to 55.6 a month earlier. US manufacturing PMI for December came in at 57.1 in December, up from 56.7 in November. That marked the steepest improvement in US manufacturing activity in more than six years - since September 2014. It was also higher than the flash reading of 56.5. Fresh data from the Bank of England showed that UK lenders approved nearly 105,000 new mortgages in November, the highest number since the global financial crisis in August 2007. However, unsecured lending fell by Â£1.5bn as borrowers made larger payments on their debts. Thatâ€™s all from us today. Stay safe and weâ€™ll be back tomorrow morning. â€“KM"
2021-01-04T13:06:51Z,business,Business,Ladbrokes owner’s shares leap after it rejects £8.1bn MGM bid,"The gambling company behind Ladbrokes and Coral has rebuffed an £8.1bn takeover proposal from its US partner, MGM Resorts, as the arrival of legal sports betting in the US continues to fuel transatlantic dealmaking. Entain said the offer from MGM, the owner of the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas, significantly undervalued the company and its prospects. Shares in Entain, which owns a host of online betting brands and more than 3,300 high street bookmakers, closed up 25% at £14.16 on Monday, suggesting traders think MGM could increase its offer beyond the £13.83 bid on the table. MGM swooped for Entain just a few months after the US operator’s rival Caesars Entertainment bought William Hill for £2.9bn, underscoring the appetite for UK firms’ technology and experience in the newly regulated US gambling market. Since the US supreme court legalised sports betting in 2018, a flurry of British firms have established beachheads in the US, exploiting expertise gleaned from years of operating freely in the UK. But state laws have required them to do so in partnership with local US casino operators that typically hold the limited number of sports wagering licences to be awarded. Analysts said US casino investors were no longer happy to share the spoils and were looking to buy out their British partners instead. Alun Bowden, the head of European markets at the US-based gambling consultancy Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, said it made sense to spend billions on knowhow that UK firms already possessed. “The US market is moving so quickly that to spend one or two years building that up, at the absolute minimum, is just time nobody has to spend,” he said. “The casino firms probably underestimated the growth of both the online gambling market there and the impact on share prices. I think everyone did. “Two years ago they were happy to do joint ventures and effectively lease the brand for a revenue share deal to European operators. Now they really want to have full ownership of their involvement in the market.” Entain, which was known as GVC until shareholders voted for a name change last month, started a 50/50 joint venture, BetMGM, with MGM in 2018, offering online sports betting and casino games in the growing number of US states where it is legal. Before the supreme court overturned the ban on sports betting, Nevada – home to Las Vegas – was the only state where it was allowed. A further 18 states have joined Nevada, and more are either expected to follow suit or are already doing so. The California market alone is thought to be worth more than the UK’s.
Darin Oliver, the managing director of the gambling advisory business Simply Alpha Capital and a former deputy director of licensing at the Alderney gambling control commission, predicted in 2018 that MGM would eventually buy Entain. He agreed that MGM’s bid undervalued Entain and suggested the joint venture could eventually be hived off and would be worth “billions of dollars” alone if it were floated on the stock market. “The sports betting market in the US is going crazy,” he said. “There are limited entrants, the valuations are very high and there’s a belief that you need to get in early and establish spots. “Covid hasn’t been a drag because the market sees it as being a temporary thing that won’t have an impact on behaviours. If it does, it’s most likely to increase online sports wagering than reduce it.” Oliver said some other British or European firms were less exciting targets for a highly regulated US firm because they still operated in so-called “grey markets”, territories where gambling is not legal. Entain “is perfect for a US gambling operator to acquire since it’s likely to not have any dirty laundry in it. It’s the last man standing in that department,” he added. Under UK takeover law MGM has until 1 February to either announce its firm intention to make an offer or to withdraw. MGM Resorts was approached for comment."
2021-01-04T11:00:34Z,business,Business,How the 'shecession' will cause long-term harm for women in the US,"For the first time in history, the US is in a “shecession” – an economic downturn where job and income losses are affecting women more than men. The term was coined by C Nicole Mason, president and chief executive of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR), a thinktank.
Mason put forward the term to highlight the disproportionate impact of this economic downturn on women. More than 11 million women have lost their jobs and another 2.65 million have left the workforce since February, according to an IWPR analysis of labor department data. Mason spoke to the Guardian recently about what needs to change to get an equitable economic recovery. What is your assessment of Congress’s discussions about an economic recovery package? What’s frustrating about this process for me is that it doesn’t feel as though politicians on both sides of the aisle are putting families first, workers first, people first, and are sort of preoccupied with their political standings … It just makes me think that they really are having a hard time understanding how this downturn is impacting working families. What are the long-term consequences of not responding to these issues, particularly for women of color? The long-term consequences are very clear: housing insecurity and food insecurity are just two. There’s been a moratorium on evictions, but when that expires and rent comes due, many families are not going to be able to pay. It’s been delayed at this point, but we will probably see a housing crisis in 2021, whether it’s rentals or mortgages. Many women, women of color, have been unemployed for 28 weeks or more. So the longer women stay out of the workforce the harder it is for them to get a job or return to the workforce. That will definitely have a long-term impact on their long-term economic security and wellbeing, and their earnings. Especially if you think about women in the service sector. The service sector is one of those industries where experience doesn’t count as much. I know a woman who has been working at the same company in the food industry for 20 years and she lost her job. You can imagine over time, she got incremental raises or wage increases. But in the food sector and hospitality, you apply for a job and start at the bottom again. It’s not that you can say “Hey at my other food service job I was there for 20 years and when I left I was making $25 an hour.” If the minimum wage or starting wage for a food service job is $15 an hour and there are people scrambling for these jobs because we’ve lost so many, that’s what you will earn. Since the last recession, there has been a lot of attention towards men who lost out on work and have seen their position shift in the country. Are we going to be talking about angry women in the next five years who are voting because they feel left behind by the country? Even when the presidential candidates were campaigning and talking about job creation, Joe Biden was in a factory, in a hard hat, talking about how we are going to get people back to work. And I thought “Who is he talking about?” Or even when Donald Trump said “Don’t worry women, we’ll get jobs for your husbands.” What I am fearful of is that despite the fact that women have been the most impacted – care is one of the chief barriers for women returning to work – we’re going to try to duplicate the recovery package we saw in 2008 to get people back to work and it’s just going to miss the point. Because I do anticipate a really big, robust recovery plan to come down the pipe that is going to focus on job creation and it’s going to be stuff like “We’re going to build roads, solar paneling,” and it’s just, we need infrastructure like care, not infrastructure like roads. That’s fine, but we also need to focus on people who have been most impacted by this economic downturn. Are there places where you see hope? There’s a cluster of women’s organizations and thinktanks who have been beating this drum … I’m slightly optimistic and I just think we also need to continue to put pressure on. I know there are a lot of competing priorities for the incoming administration but we only have one big shot in the beginning to make sure that we can get on the road to an equitable, even recovery. And if we leave women out or don’t center them in the discussion, we’re going to be back in six months trying to figure out how to do that. If Biden called and asked what should we do, would you hand him your Building the Future report? Yes. I would hand him the report and say these are things that need to happen. These are not just sort of quick fixes. These are structural and institutional changes that need to happen. Some of it is short-term and what we need now. But this is not going to be the last recession, so we need to be doing the work now to repair those broken systems, to create a vibrant and real social safety net that is not necessarily means-tested but that everyone has access to when there is a need is really, critically important. We are going to need to reimagine some of our social programs, our social safety net, and our infrastructure: health and care. We need to make sure the next time around, we’re not having to pump trillions of dollars in economic relief because we have a solid infrastructure in place and we just pull those levers.

2021-01-04T00:01:21Z,business,Business,UK music streaming hits a high note amid the lows of Covid,"The angst-laden ballads of Lewis Capaldi were the biggest soundtrack of pandemic Britain, industry figures for 2020 show, as streaming of music shot up by more than 20% in lockdown. Streaming accounted for more than 80% of overall music consumption in the UK last year, when people listened to 139bn audio streams, up from 114bn in 2019. CD sales fell by almost a third year on year, although the fringe market in vinyl and even audio cassettes continued to rise. UK artists led by Capaldi, Harry Styles and Dua Lipa accounted for eight of the top 10 albums. Nearly 200 artists were streamed more than 100m times, with the BPI hailing a new wave of diverse talent fuelling music industry growth, including acts such as Aitch, AJ Tracey, Headie One, J Hus and KSI.
The 24-year-old Scottish singer-songwriter’s Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent was the most streamed album for a second successive year in the UK, with tracks whose lyrics appositely spoke of of “day bleed[ing] into nightfall” in isolation. Capaldi also recorded two of the top 10 selling singles, a chart topped by The Weeknd’s Blinding Lights. According to record labels’ association the BPI, consumption was up for a sixth successive year, with the equivalent of 155m albums sold, up 8.2% on last year. The figures have been recalibrated to include an element of video streaming weighted alongside other paid audio streams. The increase in listening came as the live sector was all but wiped out by lockdown rules to combat the pandemic – and in spite of a dip in demand at the start of the first lockdown in spring. The BPI said that streaming was fuelled by labels’ increasing investment in A&R, or artists and repertoire, the talent scouting and artistic development side of the industry. A&R spending rose above £250m in 2019, bringing in more diverse talent from rap, hip-hop, dance and other genres. The BPI’s chief executive, Geoff Taylor, said: “A new wave of British talent is capitalising on the immediacy of streaming to achieve fantastic success, measured in the hundreds of millions, even billions of streams. Record labels are investing heavily in new artists to secure the future of British music, boosting the UK’s exports and soft power.” He added: “The performance of recorded music in 2020 was remarkable, and reminds us how important music is to our country, even when our lives are disrupted.”
The top 10 streaming artists in 2020 each achieved more than half a billion streams in the UK alone, while 8,000 different acts now total more than 1m streams annually. CD sales slumped a further 31% to 16m units in the UK, although the BPI said the format was resilient and still played a key role. Drew Hill, the managing director of distributor Proper Music, said they remained a “kingmaker”, with most number one albums still getting there by having the most physical sales. Sales of vinyl records continued their resurrection as a premium and collectors’ format, increasing for the 13th consecutive year, by 11.5% to 4.8m copies purchased. Top sellers were the reissued albums of happier decades: Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours, followed by Oasis and Amy Winehouse.
An even unlikelier, if very niche, revival has been the audio cassette, whose UK sales almost doubled to 157,000 copies, led by Lady Gaga’s Chromatica. Hill added: “As we celebrate this streaming boom, it’s important we also remember the ongoing fan demand for something tangible and recognise that streaming and physical music coexist quite happily.” Meanwhile, Taylor said it was critical that the government supported venues and festivals during the continued Covid restrictions until the sector could re-emerged, with live revenues being a significant part of many artists’ income. Despite the growth in streaming, he said: “Any satisfaction we can take is tempered by the devastating impact of the pandemic on live music. We renew our calls on government to support our culturally important venues, nightclubs and festivals until they can safely reopen.”"
2021-01-03T12:00:07Z,business,Business,Four Seasons Total Landscaping gave us all a lighthearted lesson in 2020 | Gene Marks,"For many US small businesses, 2020 was not a funny – or fun – year at all. It’s hard to find any humor in a year that a pandemic caused the deaths of more than 350,000 people, destroyed jobs for more than 12 million and ruined countless restaurants and other small businesses in the fitness, arts, travel and retail industries.
But last year one small business did give us all a reason to laugh. That small business is Four Seasons Total Landscaping in, of all places, my home town of Philadelphia. Four Seasons Total Landscaping became a worldwide story when President Trump’s campaign announced a surprise press conference – on the day the election results for Pennsylvania and other states were released – in their parking lot on State Road in the north-east section of the city. The announcement befuddled both supporters and opponents alike. The press conference – like so many others of this administration – was a confused, rambling affair. No one knew if this was actually planned or just a mix-up with the Four Seasons hotel near Broad Street. No one could figure out if Trump even knew what was happening. It happened anyway. And the whole thing was very funny. It was funny because of the imagery: Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani fighting for his boss’s political life surrounded by other small businesses typical to State Road – a sex shop and a crematorium – and of course with the Four Seasons Total Landscaping sign prominently behind him. It was funny because it was absurd and surprising and curious. It was funny because no one admitted this was a mistake. Was it? It was funny because the incident occurred in a city where Trump had recently warned “bad things happen”. To him apparently. But the real reason why this story was so funny is because of Marie Siravo, the owner of Four Seasons Total Landscaping. She and her team’s response to what happened wasn’t partisan. It was a perfectly American lesson in business savvy. Siravo saw the humor. She also saw the dollar signs. Doing her best to stay out of politics she doubled down on the unprecedented exposure her small business received. Siravo immediately spruced up her website. She posted a politically astute Facebook message that any seasoned PR professional would be proud of. She sold tongue-in-cheek shirts that said “Make America Rake Again” and “Lawn and Order” and coined phrases like “in sod we trust” on other promotional items. She participated in the quickly organized “Fraud Street Run” which drew 2,100 participants and began from her parking lot. She embraced the crowds and the people who – to this day – stop by for a quick picture of political history. “We’re not making any political statements,” she told the Philadelphia Inquirer. “We’re running with this and enjoying it. It’s like a magic carpet ride.” Four Seasons Total Landscaping represents the very definition of the typical American small business. The media likes to glamorize those tech-savvy, venture capital-backed entrepreneurs starting up the next big thing in Silicon Valley and Austin. But there are 30m small businesses in this country. Most, like Siravo’s, are family-owned and -operated. They typically provide an un-sexy but necessary service … like landscaping. Similar to Siravo, they usually employ fewer than 30 full-time people and are typically located on the State Roads of their home towns. You know these businesses. These are not businesses that would be talked about by Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers and James Corden. Or profiled by the BBC. Or featured on The Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live. Or written about here in the Guardian.
But this company was. And that’s funny too. So Siravo – like so many smart entrepreneurs navigating the changing dynamic of 2020 – pivoted. She converted her conference room into a fulfillment center, not for landscaping jobs, but to assemble and sell more than 35,000 T-shirts, sweaters and face masks which racked up more than $1.3m in sales to customers like Jake Tapper, Mike Myers and Emma Watson. She appeared on TV and other media outlets because, like a shrewd small business owner, she wasn’t going to let a good PR opportunity get away. “You know, a lot of companies don’t do snow, don’t do irrigation, don’t do planning,” she reminded us in one interview. “So that’s where ‘total’ came from.” I did not know that. Now I do. That’s funny. The whole story is funny because it came at a very unfunny time. Everyone was on edge. Everyone was tired of the pandemic, worried about the election and generally stressed out over the future. And then we heard about this strange presidential press conference at a landscaping company on State Road that sounded too much like the five-star hotel in town and … we laughed. We read about this small business owner’s lighthearted, entrepreneurial response and we chuckled. We admired her pluck, her self-effacing humor and her ingenuity. It was a funny story and we were reminded that we can all – Democrat and Republican – appreciate a funny story. And more importantly, we were reminded just how much we, as Americans, appreciate our country’s small business owners."
2021-01-03T11:32:37Z,business,Business,The 'black swan' Covid catastrophe shows us just how fragile our world is | Larry Elliott,"There are three characteristics of a “black swan” event: rarity, extreme impact and retrospective predictability. With the benefit of hindsight it is always easy to spot the warning signs of a looming catastrophe, but few see them at the time. The financial crisis of 2008 was an example of a black swan, and Covid-19 is an even better one. Around this time of the year, economists tend to make predictions of what the next 12 months have in store. Some like to think outside the box and come up with whacky forecasts of unlikely events that will perhaps come to pass. Suffice it to say not one crystal-ball gazer a year ago foresaw that by December 2020 Christmas would be banned by government edict, pubs shuttered and Premier League football matches played in grounds devoid of spectators. Nobody said 2020 was going to be a plague year that would lead to more than 1.8 million deaths worldwide and bring about the biggest annual contraction of the UK economy since the Great Frost of 1709. The collective failure to anticipate a variant of the coronavirus first detected in China in late 2019 suggests we should all be careful about making bold statements about what will happen next. Perhaps, as the financial markets are signalling, the mass vaccination programmes now under way will allow life to return to something like normal by the middle of this year. It is possible 2020 will be recorded in the history books as a one-off, an aberration that signified nothing. It is worth remembering how little changed – despite all the confident predictions that there would be a political shift to the left – as a result of the near-implosion of the global banking system in 2008. There are reasons for thinking 2020 will be different and could eventually be seen as one of those years – like 1789 and 1914 – that prove pivotal. One is that the pandemic has hastened the technological change that was already happening, because social distancing and lockdowns have meant we do so many more things from home via a computer screen or a mobile phone. People have surfed the net more; they have kept in touch with their friends remotely; they have shopped online. The result is that the digital transformation of economies has been accelerated. Companies that went into the crisis powerful enough already – Google, Amazon, Facebook – have seen their market dominance strengthened. Working from home has been terrible for the commercial property sector, but great for Zoom. For years, there has been talk of how biotechnology would form a crucial part of a fourth industrial revolution. Its response to the pandemic has proved this is not just hype. It has been staggering how quickly vaccines were developed and produced. Genome sequencing has made it possible to identify mutations of the coronavirus.
Running alongside accelerated technological change has been a shift towards bigger states, which have spent a lot more, borrowed a lot more and bossed people around a lot more. Before the crisis erupted, Rishi Sunak expected to borrow about £60bn in the current financial year. He will be lucky if the figure turns out to be less than £400bn. In reality, the chancellor – along with other finance ministers – has had no choice. Governments have taken deliberate decisions to close down large chunks of the economy and so have been obliged to take unprecedented action to prevent mass unemployment and widespread destitution. Sunak talks a lot about how he has a moral duty to balance the budget but is an unconvincing iron chancellor. Some governments have had better crises than others. Ironically, the country that gave the world Covid-19 – China – is poised to be the only major economy to register positive growth this year. Neighbouring countries – Taiwan, South Korea and Vietnam – were all better prepared for the pandemic than Europe or the US. Recent decades have seen a shift in the global balance of power from west to east, and that trend has continued. The US emerges from 2020 relatively weaker, China relatively stronger. Donald Trump’s hawkish line towards Beijing is unlikely to soften much when Joe Biden arrives at the White House this month.
The story of globalisation over the past three decades has been of developed countries outsourcing production to places where wage costs were lower. Relying on China for PPE and other medical equipment looked a lot less clever as the crisis erupted. There is now a recognition that there is a price to be paid for long and complex supply chains, as there is for an economic model that pays too little heed to sustainability. In the past, deep recessions have tended to push green issues down the political pecking order, but this time it has been different. Quite rightly, the thinking has been that if 2008 was a financial emergency and 2020 has been a medical emergency, then next time – and the assumption is that there will be a next time – it could be a climate emergency. Understandably, there is a yearning for life to return to normal and when the fight against Covid-19 is finally over people are going to enjoy doing all the things that lockdowns and social distancing currently prevent or restrict. It will be boom time for the high street; it will be hard to get a restaurant booking; low-cost airlines will be running at full capacity. In the short-term it will look like business as usual. But Covid-19 has forced us to rethink the way we work, how we shop, the role of government, how the economy works at a national and global level. Above all, it has shown us how fragile everything is."
2021-01-03T07:00:00Z,business,Business,"If Sunak can lobby for banks post-Brexit, he must do it for other services too","Brexit is done, and yet loose ends litter the negotiating room floor, now abandoned by both sides to satisfy Boris Johnson’s need for a 1 January deadline. The trade deal with the EU, approved by parliament last week, was not the comprehensive, neatly tied bundle of tariff and quota arrangements that was promised. Instead it is shot through with holes. In the coming months, No 10 and the Treasury will convene a team whose first job will be to examine how the financial services industry can mend one of these holes – the major obstacle to trade with the EU that results from having no arrangements in place to cover the broader services sector. Services account for around 80% of the UK’s economic activity and about 50% of its exports by value to the EU. While Britain runs a large deficit on the export of goods to the EU, there is always a modest surplus in services – much of it accounted for by the success of London’s City financiers – to close the gap. There may be little sympathy for bankers and insurers complaining about being left to fend for themselves. But the sheer scale of the foreign earnings that the sector brings back to the UK, which also closes the yawning balance of payments deficit Britain runs with the rest of the world, is crucial, at least in the short term. The chancellor said he hoped a planned memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the issue would reassure the EU and persuade Brussels to give the City of London the access it craves. A promise made by the British chancellor of the exchequer that the UK will “remain in close dialogue with our European partners when it comes to things like equivalence decisions” is supposed to do the trick.
We will all find out over the coming months whether Rishi Sunak’s name commands respect in Brussels to the extent that the commission accepts an MoU in exchange for full-ish access. After all, Brussels has already agreed to roll over current arrangements for clearing euro-denominated derivatives – a business dominated by London clearing houses – for fear that this business would disappear to New York. But as the City lobby group TheCityUK has argued, that agreement replicates just one out of almost 50 treaties that would need to be negotiated within the framework set by an MoU. And as if this mountain were not already high enough, EU negotiators are still angry at the betrayals and tactical shifting by the prime minister over the last 18 months, and wary about any such handshake agreement with his right-hand man. This wariness is also likely to extend to London’s plan for other services to gain access to the single market. It’s true that solicitors have secured an agreement to have their qualifications recognised across the EU, but there is little likelihood that other services will be granted entry to the single market without huge sacrifices from the UK government. Maybe Johnson considers further compromise acceptable now that he has herded his backbenchers through the aye lobby in favour of his deal. More likely he will urge services firms to look beyond Europe to grab profitable contracts in Asia, the Middle East and the US. The same principle could be applied to banks and insurers. It won’t be, though. For Sunak, that would be too much of a risk. And yet, if a deal proves possible for financial services, then the opportunity should be taken to seek better access for other sectors. The UK is over-dependent on the profits from finance and a shift is long overdue. Brexit might have provided an opportunity to rebalance. Not to deny the City profit, at least not in the short term, but to expand access for other world-beating services industries. Sadly, this chance looks like being squandered. As Boeing moves past its Max woes, a graver aviation crisis looms Airline passengers do not appear to have long memories: they eagerly return to the skies even after the highest-profile disasters, such as the 9/11 hijackings in 2001. That bodes well for Boeing, which has finally brought its 737 Max plane back into service after two fatal crashes killed 346 people and caused its global grounding. Last Tuesday, paying customers in the US took off in a 737 Max for the first time since March 2019, marking the end of a crisis period for Boeing. However, the crashes and subsequent investigations, notably by the US Congress, lifted the lid on a corporate culture where safety did not appear to be the top priority. It must be hoped Boeing has repaired that too, as it and the entire aviation industry prepare for arguably their biggest challenge in the coming decades: finding a way to be part of a net-zero economy. Flying causes enormous environmental harm. Eradicating carbon dioxide emissions from planes is one key climate challenge that has yet to be truly confronted, as authorities such as the UK’s Committee on Climate Change have noted. The technology to do so simply does not exist yet. Aerospace manufacturers will face a delicate task in managing the expectations of governments and the public, who will wonder why they cannot follow the example of carmakers and embrace electrification. The comparison with carmakers is instructive: Volkswagen, the world’s largest by volume, was rapidly brought to its knees by a failure to tackle pollution – and systematic attempts to cover it up. All companies – even Boeing, a pillar of the military-industrial establishment – need to constantly renew their social licence to operate by seeking to minimise harm to customers or the environment. The 737 Max crisis showed what happens if a business loses sight of that duty. In a sad year for shops, the quirky and local may come up smiling It has been a grim year for retail, with 177,000 people estimated to have lost their jobs and thousands of shops permanently closing their doors. The new year is set to begin in the same vein, with the future of distressed chains Debenhams, Topshop and Peacocks likely to be decided. Thousands more jobs are expected to go, as rescue deals are unlikely to include the full high street estates of these ageing behemoths. After months of enforced closures, further retail casualties are also expected to emerge, with clothing specialists and those reliant on city centres among the most vulnerable. However, some major businesses will increase their dominance in this difficult environment. Next has already taken advantage of its position as a well-resourced multichannel player to adapt and update itself. Its distribution deal with US lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret, and its shift into beauty halls on former Debenhams sites, is set to be followed by other acquisitions – possibly including Topshop. Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, meanwhile, may take on at least some Debenhams stores. While the Sports Direct owner should never be underestimated, the group may suffer some indigestion as it tries to knock ailing House of Fraser together with battered Debenhams. The downsizing of those department stores may ultimately help the likes of John Lewis and Marks & Spencer, but they will face difficult months battling against heavy discounting from these troubled rivals. But it’s not all doom for physical retail. A surprise winner from the pandemic is the local high street. And that benefit may well continue as people carry on spending at least part of their working week at home, where they have grown to appreciate independent operators with a local flavour. Cheaper rents and empty sites could also provide the opportunity for new ideas to bubble up. Once the virus subsides, there will be many desperate to visit after months stuck in their homes."
2021-01-03T00:05:52Z,business,Business,Ebullient analysts predict markets will weather the storm in 2021,"The new year is traditionally a time for looking forwards, for hopeful resolutions, for celebrating. But for economists and investors, the annual forecasts for 2021 might be something of a painful reminder of exactly how much they failed to foresee. The pandemic quickly made a mockery of all projections. An entertaining analysis of US chief executives’ statements during 2020 by data company Sentieo for the New York Times showed a 70,000% year-on-year rise in the use of “unprecedented”, while “humbled” tripled – perhaps code for “it wasn’t my fault, so you should still pay me the same”. To be fair, though, in March it really did feel like nobody had a clue what to do – even governments, who are meant to have “pandemic” firmly on their risk radars. But investors have not been punished too harshly for their failure to foresee the outbreak. London’s FTSE 100 benchmark declined 15% during 2020 – the worst performance since the financial crisis in 2008, but hardly as eyecatching as the wider economic collapse, which was on a scale not seen in the UK since 1706. In the US, the pandemic added to the astonishing dominance of the big tech companies such as Apple, Amazon, and Google, meaning that the S&P 500 has actually gained about 15% in 2020. For 2021, the big question is exactly how much is left in the recovery that has been taking place since the dark days of March. The positive results for what is turning into a host of vaccines appear at least to have laid the groundwork for a return to something like normality. Despite the travails of the last year, analysts are sounding notes of cautious optimism for the year ahead. And at least one uncertainty has been put to bed. After the sound and the very considerable fury, the UK left the EU for practical purposes at 11pm on Thursday – it was central Europe that enjoyed the romance of uncoupling at the stroke of midnight, central European time, in a last sting of the negotiators’ tail. The jury is still very much out on the questionable merits of the trade deal, but at least businesses know exactly how much extra paperwork they are dealing with – albeit with a shamefully tiny amount of time allowed for them to prepare. So, to stock predictions. Nick Nelson at UBS was among the braver UK analysts to actually put a number on what will happen in 2021: he said the FTSE 100 would end the year at 7200 points, roughly a 10% gain compared to the 6460 mark at the end of 2020. In the US some investors are more bullish: Goldman Sachs predicted the S&P 500, the US benchmark, would end the year near 4300 points, an increase of about 15%, even if a clutch of other Wall Street investment banks think 3900 is a more realistic target. But if things do not pan out quite as hoped, at least we know who to look to. Central banks have been the only game in town – and the referee, to boot – since the global financial crisis and its drawn-out aftermath. The pandemic showed that the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England were more ready than ever to do anything to prevent a collapse. In the context of the last decade-and-a-bit, betting that they will continue to prop up markets for as long as they can is the nearest we have to a sure thing."
2021-01-02T16:00:43Z,business,Business,'We'll emerge leaner and more efficient': Covid's impact on business,"The year 2020 was tumultuous for businesses of all sizes, and companies from FTSE giants to sole traders have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. In the spring, the Observer spoke to four bosses to ask how they were managing during the early stages of the crisis. We revisited them to find out how the rest of the year unfolded, and to ask about the lasting impact of Covid-19. Johan Lundgren, chief executive, easyJet In one respect, things have improved for easyJet over the course of the pandemic: a few planes, at least, are in the sky. Back in April, its entire 337-strong fleet was grounded and Lundgren’s overriding preoccupation was liquidity: how to keep the business afloat with its enormous fixed costs, even when most staff were furloughed. A few weeks of lockdown, Lundgren declared then, was already the biggest crisis airlines had ever known. Eight months on, he says 2020 was “the toughest year the aviation and travel industry has ever faced”. He remains positive that the situation is temporary: “We know there is huge pent-up demand for travel as we see that every time restrictions are lifted.” Every time indeed: although travel restarted in June, restrictions were lifted – and then reimposed – in a manner that caused the industry frustration at the lack of guidance and collective international decision-making. Summer saw the UK introducing “travel corridors” to easyJet’s biggest leisure markets before swiftly deciding the likes of Spain should be off limits after all. The share price, which had rebounded on hopes that the summer season was the start of some normality, deflated again until news of a vaccine reassured investors. “The vaccine is the key to unlocking travel,” says Lundgren. “Once unlocked, our ability to travel, which people had taken for granted before the pandemic, will be valued and treasured once again.” The key question has been whether airlines can survive that long. EasyJet has burned through its cash at more than £50m a week though refinancing, including a £600m government-backed loan and the renegotiated order for Airbus planes, has given it a sounder financial base than most. Around a third of the 14,000 pre-Covid staff have been laid off, and its fleet of aircraft is likely to be 10% smaller when leases expire in 2021. Other measures, such as charging for overhead lockers, have highlighted the desperation. However, Lundgren says: “Our core strengths remain unaffected by the crisis and in fact will be even more important in the months to come – passengers will choose to travel with companies they trust and, more than ever, will seek value with friendly and reliable service.” EasyJet hopes the latest wave of cancellations due to the new strain of Covid-19 identified in the UK are just another bump on the taxiway. Lundgren insists: “We will emerge from this crisis leaner and more efficient, so we are positioned to bounce back quickly when demand returns – and it will return.” Gwyn Topham
Philip Jansen, chief executive, BT From catching Covid and handling attacks on engineers to coping with record lockdown broadband traffic, while committing billions to upgrading the nation’s internet and mobile networks, Jansen is juggling a balancing act designed to reignite BT’s share price as the driver of Britain’s digital revolution. Jansen was the first FTSE 100 chief executive to contract Covid back in March, when the UK had reported just 11 deaths and 800 cases. Since then BT has had to weather a combination of the impact of the pandemic and crucial government decisions on 5G. The pandemic has been a double-edged sword for BT, which early on was hit by plunging sports revenues at its pay-TV operation, BT Sport, and its enterprise arm felt the impact of struggling cost-conscious businesses cutting back. In July, the government added to the burden with the surprise move to ban the use of Chinese tech firm Huawei’s equipment in the UK’s 5G mobile networks, resulting in a £500m bill to strip it all out. Jansen has focused heavily on cost-cutting to help balance the books at BT, including the mobile operator EE and Openreach, which runs most of the UK’s broadband network, with £2bn targeted by 2025. BT has reduced its headcount of 120,000 directly and indirectly employed staff by 3,600 this year, although Jansen says much of this has been achieved by a recruitment freeze. “We knew where revenue was headed and put the brakes on costs, anything not essential, including stopping recruitment for any role not in frontline customer service,” he says. “We gave [pay] increases to all frontline staff, not managers; no one has lost their job as a direct result of coronavirus at BT.” BT employs 45,000 frontline staff, from the operators in 999 call centres it runs to 30,000 engineers maintaining the UK’s infrastructure. Jansen remains incensed at the spate of attacks on mobile phone masts – and staff – by conspiracy theorists who have wrongly linked 5G to the spread of the virus. “We had people attacking engineers; we had one engineer stabbed and have seen 140 sites damaged,” he says. As the pandemic has unfolded, BT has benefited from a surge in customers upgrading broadband and mobile packages due to the demands of remote working and lockdown leisure time. Jansen says the busiest day in BT’s history to date was 16 December, when a combination of events including Amazon streaming a full round of Premier League football games and an update to the game Call of Duty pushed broadband usage to a peak. He has been confident enough to upgrade BT’s profit outlook with a return to pre-Covid levels of £7.9bn by the year ending March 2023. After years of feet-dragging over upgrading the national broadband network from copper wires to full fibre broadband, which has made the UK a global laggard and resulted in Boris Johnson making the issue of catchup a Tory election pledge, Jansen has forced a change in strategy with a £12.5bn investment pledge to expedite deployment. The plan, which saw a call for 5,000 new engineers, resulted in the scrapping of BT’s £1.5bn dividend for two years – the first time shareholders have forgone payments since 1984. Telecoms companies are struggling with investor confidence and BT’s share price is down 35% over the last year. “The share price has been disappointing, but we have faced an enormous amount of headwinds and uncertainty and a profile of massive investment all at the same time,” says Jansen. “The economics of the industry are very challenging and we have had to quite rightly focus on the long term. Shareholders can expect a good return from a once-in-a-generation investment.” Mark Sweney
Neil Clifford, chief executive, Kurt Geiger “The No 1 shoe of 2020 is officially the slipper,” says Neil Clifford, the chief executive of footwear retailer Kurt Geiger, more usually known for its glamorous heels and party shoes. “We could have sold five times more slippers than we bought. We’ve virtually sold out. Sales were up 400%.” Unfortunately, the rush on cosy footwear has not offset a dive in sales of high heels and work shoes, delivering a tough year for Kurt Geiger in which total sales have fallen by about 40%. While that fall is not as bad as the two-thirds drop experienced in April, the company has had to make 600 redundancies and nearly half its remaining 1,850 staff are on furlough. Clifford has slashed costs, taking the business rates holiday and shifting 90% of stores to turnover-only rents, up from 70% before the pandemic. He says he is worried about having to make further job cuts amid another high street lockdown. “The next three months are going to be terrible but beyond that retailers have to be optimistic or die. Once we get into Easter and your nan’s been vaccinated, people will be desperate to get back to normal. We’ll be so grateful to be able to dress up and go out for dinner or go on holiday,” Clifford says. He says the company has performed well in difficult circumstances, adapting to increased demand for handbags – which now make up 30% of the group’s sales – and hats, scarves and other accessories. Online sales are up 40% year on year, reaching a level the company did not expect to make until 2025. With support from Kurt Geiger’s bank, Lloyds, and the private equity backer Cinven, as well as from landlords, only one store, in Covent Garden, London, has permanently closed. Clifford still reckons it will take three years to rebuild to where Kurt Geiger started the year – on a high with record takings of nearly £400m, underlying profits of £40m and 10 new shops planned. He says: “We still believe in the shop. We are a nation of shoppers and love social shopping. Once you are safe again people will be back.” Sarah Butler
James Morris, managing director, Trafalgar Marquees When coronavirus first struck in the spring, James Morris’s marquee hire company only had six weeks’ cash in the bank, and he was staring down the barrel of a summer of cancelled bookings. Trafalgar Marquees, which he founded using his student overdraft in 2007, had been looking forward to its busiest ever year. The firm’s diary was full of bookings for its marquees, furniture and lighting for events ranging from corporate meetings to outdoor operas and food festivals. “April feels like a lifetime ago,” remembers Morris. “It’s not been without its moments. But we put in a lot of hard work in the early days to try to pivot the business from events to temporary structures, and it has worked out alright.” The firm has hired out its marquees to a range of clients to be used as temporary canteens, classrooms and warehouses. Unlike many others in the events industry, Morris considers himself lucky to have been able to continue operating during the pandemic. As a result of this new business, trade has recovered and Trafalgar Marquees is now making about half of its previous income, up from 15% of normal levels in the spring. Morris has also been able to hold on to all nine of his full-time staff, thanks to the government’s furlough scheme. In the spring, the company hurriedly tried to cut costs, and applied unsuccessfully for an overdraft extension with its bank, NatWest. While he said he would not describe the lender as “hugely supportive”, Morris was eventually able to secure a £50,000 government bounce back loan. “It was a great help, but for a business the size of ours it doesn’t go very far when you aren’t taking any income,” he says, adding that the company burned through £23,000 of cash a month even when its income had shrunk to zero. Morris is confident his company will survive the pandemic. However, the events of 2020 have left their mark: the firm will continue to rent out its marquees for live events, but this will only account for part of its business. “It is a completely different business to the one we were looking at back in January,” he says. While Morris is more positive about the year to come, much remains uncertain. “No one wants to commit to event bookings, and in turn that makes it hard for us to plan our resources and our team,” he says. “I struggle to see a return to events as we knew them in 2021.” Joanna Partridge"
2021-01-02T16:00:42Z,business,Business,'Energy needed a digital revolution â€“ and we are it',"Greg Jackson, chief executive of Octopus Energy, wears the unassuming combination of jeans and trainers one might expect from the founder of a wildly successful startup. There’s also a vast open-plan central London office, easy camaraderie with staff, lots of plants. He has the enthusiasm and world-changing idealism too. With all these markers of a tech unicorn – a deal last month with Tokyo Gas valued it at $2bn (£1.5bn) – it’s easy to forget that Octopus is an energy company. Jackson, 49, says the distinction is increasingly irrelevant. Octopus is a new breed of energy supplier, built on cutting-edge technology and unencumbered by the creaking billing systems and fossil-fuel plants that plague the UK’s “big six”. Set up just five years ago, it has been free to view the energy market as a tech startup would: ripe for disruption. This has made Octopus Britain’s fastest-growing energy supplier, and helped it agree that Japanese deal – under which it will supply energy to homes in Japan, while Tokyo Gas takes a near-10% stake in Octopus. “When we started the company a lot of people asked how we planned to take on the big six. They looked like big companies. But on a global scale, they’re not that big,” Jackson said in an interview shortly before the Tokyo Gas deal was announced. Octopus Energy is backed by investment firm Octopus Group and has more than a million UK energy customers. But Jackson’s vision goes well beyond Britain. A serial tech entrepreneur (and former coffee shop owner), he believes Octopus Energy could become the first home-grown energy supplier to reach 100 million homes. And he plans to reach this ambitious milestone within a few years. “If we look downhill, we’ve come a long way and can be incredibly proud,” says Jackson, whose stake in Octopus is now worth £115m. “But the global energy market is worth about $2 trillion a year and will grow to $4tn as we run more of our transport and heating on electricity. This means our global market share is about 0.2%. We’ve a long way to go.”
The beating heart of this ambition is Octopus’s energy software, now known as Kraken, which helps it run a super-efficient energy operation, and has helped unlock the future benefits of low-carbon energy. “When we set out, we knew a lot about technology,” said Jackson. “We didn’t know about energy, but we could see that the sector had not yet had a digital revolution. From windfarms to household, it ran on systems that were two decades old.” Fossil fuel plants are turned on and off to meet fluctuating demand. But in a world where cheap and abundant renewable energy is charging millions of batteries in homes and cars, consumers can become active participants in the energy system. Octopus made headlines earlier this year by paying its customers to use electricity when Britain’s renewable energy reached record highs. It’s one example of a future hi-tech energy system that empowers individuals. “Electricity is becoming a tech sector,” said Jackson. Kraken’s “elec-tech” software could facilitate a new way of using energy, and underpin Britain’s green industrial revolution. “When a customer comes home and plugs in their electric car,” he says, “Kraken will automatically charge when electricity is cheap, and sell energy back to the grid when it’s expensive. By morning you’d have a fully charged vehicle at the lowest possible cost.” In future this could be extended to entire districts: neighbourhoods full of batteries quietly acting as virtual power plants. “This could be the backbone of the green industrial revolution. But we need to empower people to make the most of ‘green electrons’ when they are available. That’s what Kraken does.” Already 17 million customers are plugged into Kraken software. British energy suppliers including E.ON and Good Energy use it to run their own businesses and there are Octopus Energy outposts in Germany and the US. Earlier this year it struck a deal with Origin, Australia’s leading energy supplier, which agreed to take a 20% stake in Octopus and license the Kraken software. It is no surprise, then, that Jackson regularly refers to the tech giants that have used digital tools to build a global business. Amazon and Uber used technology to trigger a fundamental global shift in sectors which are arguably far more local and personal than energy supply. “A big cab company used to be one with more than one office. Today, Uber operates in thousands of cities across the world. So why hasn’t anyone taken a global view of energy?” he asks. “I realised I needed to be honest with myself and the team about what we can achieve if we set our minds to it. I didn’t dare say it before, but I realised that if I’m not honest, we’ll definitely fail. So now we’re wearing our ambition as a T-shirt.” Would the T-shirt in question read “world domination”? It would be a good fit with jeans and trainers either way."
2021-01-02T16:00:42Z,business,Business,Dogger Bank's giant turbines herald a wind of change in UK industry,"Beyond the horizon off the coast of North Yorkshire, a quiet revolution is emerging from the waves of the North Sea. More than 80 miles from land, hundreds of the world’s most powerful wind turbines have begun reaching into the air as construction progresses on the biggest windfarm ever built. Almost 200 turbines, each almost as tall as the Eiffel tower, will soon rise above the submerged Doggerland to populate an expanse of sea as large as North Yorkshire itself. The Dogger Bank windfarm is an engineering feat that marks a step change in the growth of renewable energy. Each steel structure, weighing 2,800 tonnes, has been designed to soar more than 250 metres from where their heels are buried in the seabed to the top of each 107-metre blade. The staggering scale of the turbines means that each one can generate enough electricity to power 16,000 homes, at less than the average price of electricity in the wholesale energy market.
This offshore windfarm, and others like it, promises to power a surge in clean electricity – which will soon be needed in vast volumes to charge cars, heat homes and produce green hydrogen gas for factories and transport. It is a central part of the government’s plan to make the UK carbon neutral by 2050, and to reimagine Britain’s global role in what will be an industrial revolution for the low-carbon age. And it is already playing a significant role: on Boxing Day, Storm Bella ensured that more than half of Britain’s daily electricity came from wind turbines for the first time. The construction of the Dogger Bank farm will fall to one of the UK’s few major renewable energy companies, SSE. Built on the legacy of some of Britain’s earliest renewable energy projects – its roots are in Scotland’s hydro-electricity board – SSE will construct the windfarm in three phases through the 2020s. Each phase represents a multimillion-pound investment, hundreds of jobs in the north-east of England, and enough clean electricity to power millions of homes. Alistair Phillips-Davies, SSE’s chief executive, announced a £6bn financing deal – involving 29 banks and advisers – last month to support the cost of building the first two phases, and the third deal could be announced by this time next year. “For SSE, and for all our staff, there’s definitely nothing that we could be more proud of at the moment than reaching financial close on what will ultimately be a £9bn project,” he said. “It will be the world’s biggest, most innovative offshore windfarm. It will generate more energy per turn of those rotors than any other project, enough to power a house for two days. But the amazing thing is, we’re going to do more. We’re going to see more and more [offshore wind] on the back of the prime minister’s 10-point plan.” Boris Johnson’s plan for a green industrial revolution relies heavily on offshore wind power, which he hopes to increase threefold to 40GW by 2030. This is important for two reasons. The first is the rapid expansion of the renewable energy industry to help generate enough clean electricity to displace fossil fuels in the energy system, as the UK works to create a net-zero-carbon economy by 2050. The second reason is to spur a supply-chain boom that can help to drive the UK’s green economic growth and create substantial numbers of “green-collar” jobs.
On a grey December day in Northumberland, Phillips-Davies led the prime minister on a tour of a wind turbine testing facility in Blyth – just one example of the industrial innovation mushrooming in several of Britain’s embattled coastal towns thanks to the burgeoning offshore wind boom. The Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult centre employs 200 people tasked with testing the equipment used to build offshore windfarms, including the world-beating turbines at Dogger Bank. In a heavily fortified state-of-the-art testing hangar, each 100-metre-long rotor blade is put through its paces to make sure that it can withstand the harsh conditions of the North Sea. This involves specially designed equipment which can “waggle” the blade through a 25-metre range, 24 hours a day, for four to six months. “We can build world-beating, world-class wind turbines, and have them tested here,” said Phillips-Davies. “But we want to get more UK content involved in our projects. We’re hoping to encourage more supply-chain companies to come to the UK so we can increase the UK-made content in our windfarms to well beyond 60%.” Today, blades for the Dogger Bank farm are manufactured overseas and shipped to Port of Tyne before being brought to the testing facility on giant barges along the river. Soon, though, the US industrial giant GE may begin building the huge turbine – known as the Haliade-X – at a factory in the UK, providing much-needed jobs for Britain’s struggling manufacturing sector.
The Dogger Bank windfarm, to date, has supported more than 300 jobs in the coastal communities of Hartlepool and Port of Tyne, which are set to reap economic benefits from the project. Employment is expected to climb into the thousands as construction on the second and third phases begins. SSE’s earlier offshore windfarms have also created new renewable energy centres along the east coast of Britain from Wick and Dundee in Scotland to the Norfolk coast. Offshore windfarms built by Danish power company Ørsted and ScottishPower Renewables have supported thousands of jobs and supply-chain hubs across the east coast of the UK too. In total, the offshore wind industry expects to create 27,000 new jobs by 2030. “A lot of these offshore facilities are in less well-known places. They’re all around the edges of the UK, in places that probably need investment and more jobs. So it’s a fantastic opportunity,” Phillips-Davies said. “I think we’re at over 1,000 green jobs created so far, and close to £10bn-worth of projects done. So we feel like we’re in a really strong place, and I hope we can go forward strongly from here over the next decade.”"
2021-01-02T05:00:29Z,business,Business,Tate & Lyle accused of betraying Cambodia families whose land was allegedly taken,"Tate & Lyle has been accused of betraying 200 families in Cambodia who have fought for years to secure compensation for land they say was taken from them to make way for a sugar plantation. Residents in Koh Kong, Cambodia, say their livelihoods, and their children’s futures, were devastated when their land was taken from them in a process that began in 2006. The land was later used to supply sugar to Tate & Lyle. Seven years ago, the Guardian interviewed affected communities who described how, without space to farm, they had little choice but to work on the plantation, which was run by Thai KSL Group. People who worked for KSL in Cambodia said they earned as little as 79p a day cutting 1,000 stems of sugar cane, and that children as young as nine were among those working. KSL subsequently denied allegations that it had used child labour, and said that its employees earned a decent wage. In 2013, 200 families from Sre Ambel district launched a lawsuit against Tate & Lyle in the high court in London, claiming that Tate & Lyle knew – or should have known – of the allegations against its supplier. They demanded compensation for the value of sugar grown on land they allege still belongs to them. Drawn-out negotiations followed, and families say that they were led to believe that they could expect significant compensation from Tate & Lyle. Yet, earlier this year, they say, the sugar company said it would not pay anything. “Initially we thought that Tate & Lyle respected human rights, and we hoped they would take responsibility,” said Ann Haiya, a community leader from Koh Kong. “The community is very, very angry and feels hopeless, but they will keep their will to work with the community leaders to keep fighting against Tate & Lyle,” he added. In a statement, Martyn Day, senior partner at the firm Leigh Day, which represents the families, said it was disappointing that Tate & Lyle had chosen to walk away from the settlement discussions. “The claimants entered into settlement discussions with Tate & Lyle in good faith over six years ago, but these discussions have led to nothing but empty promises and disappointment,” he said. Tate & Lyle, Day said, had been exclusive beneficiaries of the sugar produced on the land for a number of years and were involved in the plantation “from an early stage”. When asked whether it intended to pay compensation to affected families, Tate & Lyle Sugars said it would continue to use any leverage it had “to ensure the villagers receive financial compensation from KSL and its ex-business partner”. The company said it put pressure on its supplier over seven years “through many trips to Cambodia and meetings with various interested parties, including the Cambodian government”. Tate & Lyle used the KSL Group for its supplies from Cambodia from 2011, and stopped buying sugar from the country in 2013. The 200 families have received 1.5 hectares of land each from KSL Group through a government-led scheme, while affected communities elsewhere, who did not pursue legal action, have received financial compensation. It is understood that KSL feel they have discharged their responsibility towards the families by allocating 300 hectares of land. Tate & Lyle says it believes it helped bring about the assignment of land to families – a claim Leigh Day disputes. Community leaders say the compensation received so far is completely inadequate, and that the 1.5 hectares of land is, for many, just a fraction of what they lost. Many were forced to sell their compensation plots immediately because they desperately needed to pay off debts they had accumulated as a result of the ordeal. “Before, we used our land to cultivate rice, and farm cashew, mango and jackfruit – part of it we sell, part of it we use,” said Ann. He lost 13.5 hectares of land in 2006, he said. In order to buy food and pay for basics such as healthcare, he, like others, had little choice but to borrow money. “The loan becomes like double loan,” he said, adding that debts quickly rose. Day said that it was “wholly inadequate” for Tate & Lyle to suggest that responsibility for financial compensation lay solely with its supplier. “The losses suffered by the claimants were well documented and widely reported and Tate & Lyle were well aware of their losses when they received sugar from KSL’s plantation,” he said. The economic damage wrought on families is hard to quantify, said Eang Vuthy, executive director of Equitable Cambodia, an NGO that has supported affected families. Some young people have had to migrate to neighbouring countries, leaving their families behind, so that they can send back money. “When people migrate they are again exposed to great vulnerability in the new place,” he said. Community leaders in Koh Kong said that in many cases children had been unable to finish school because of the financial pressures facing their families, and now have even greater challenges in finding work. Eang said Tate & Lyle should commit to speedily finalising a settlement. “Until they do so, its consumers should be aware that by supporting Tate & Lyle’s business, they are making it easier for the company to avoid its responsibility.” In a statement Tate & Lyle Sugars said: “We recognise our responsibilities under the OECD guidelines for multinational companies to use our leverage to ensure our Cambodian ex-supplier KSL compensates the villagers for the damage they have suffered.” It added that it was frustrated that not all affected families have received financial compensation. “We are actively working with other stakeholders to see what pressure we can bring to bear,” the company said."
2021-01-01T22:30:21Z,business,Business,"Extend Covid measures or households face 'cliff edges', says Labour","Many low- and middle-income households will face financial hardship unless ministers maintain support for those who have lost their jobs or experienced steep cuts in income during the second wave of Covid-19, Labour has said. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said in a new year message to Rishi Sunak that the chancellor must extend a range of Covid-19 rescue measures due to run out over the next three months “to protect struggling households from financial ruin”. A mortgage holiday scheme and a ban on home repossessions should be extended beyond the 31 January cutoff date, said Dodds, while a £20-a-week boost to universal credit, due to run out on 6 April, should remain in place until the crisis is over. Analysis by the Bank of England in November found that 28% of households experienced a drop in income during the first wave of the pandemic, rising to 66% among self-employed people. Dodds said: “Whether employed, self-employed, relying on social security or a combination of all three, Britain’s beleaguered households face several cliff edges in the first few months of 2021.” The looming deadlines include: • 11 January: end of the ban on evictions. • 29 January: deadline for applications for the third grant under the self-employed income support scheme. • 31 January: end of ban on home repossessions. • 31 March: applications close for government-backed loan schemes and deadline for mortgage holidays. • 6 April: government due to cut £20-a-week boost to universal credit. • 30 April: end of the job furlough scheme. The price comparison website Energy Helpline said the number of UK consumers in debt to their electricity provider reached a five-year high during the pandemic and was on course to get worse. Citing figures obtained under a freedom of information request to the regulator, Ofgem, the website said about 777,000 households had been in debt between July and September, a number not seen since the same period in 2015. The first three quarters of the calendar year showed a rise in the number of consumers in debt to their supplier compared with the same quarter of 2019, with a 12% increase for January-March, a 5% rise in April-June and a 7% jump for July-September. It called on Ofgem and suppliers to “do all they can to support the most vulnerable consumers struggling to pay their energy bills as a result of the pandemic”. “Today’s figures could be the beginning of a surge in energy debt right across the country. Not only are consumers facing higher bills as a result of having to use more energy at home, but the pandemic is also leading to the real prospect of more expensive energy into 2021,” Energy Helpline’s director of energy, Tom Lyon, said in a statement. Labour said British households were among the worst-prepared for a financial crisis after analysis showed they entered the pandemic with one of the lowest levels of savings in the developed world. UK households saved £3,055 less than the average across other economies in the G7 group of nations in 2019, and a quarter had less than £100 in savings when the first lockdown was imposed last March.
Dodds said: “The irresponsible decisions taken by the Conservatives over the last decade left many UK households without a penny in the bank going into this crisis. When Covid hit, they had nothing to fall back on – and now some are teetering on the brink of financial ruin as several Covid support cliff edges loom. “The chancellor’s chaotic, last-minute approach to this crisis plunged the UK into the worst downturn of any major economy, but it seems he hasn’t learned any lessons. “Families up and down the country will continue to suffer if he doesn’t fix Britain’s broken safety net and tackle the root causes of income insecurity across our country.”"
2021-01-01T14:34:59Z,business,Business,"NYSE to delist three Chinese telecom firms, citing 'military links'","The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has said it will delist three Chinese telecommunications firms because of their alleged links to China’s military. China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom Hong Kong will be suspended from trading in early January, while delisting proceedings are initiated, according to a statement released by the stock exchange. The NYSE said that it had decided that the companies were “no longer suitable for listing” and was taking action to comply with an executive order signed by Donald Trump in November. The order prohibits transactions in securities “designed to provide investment exposure to such securities, of any Communist Chinese military company” by any person in the US. It is designed to prevent US investors from buying or selling shares in companies that feature on a US government blacklist. The White House has designated these firms as having links to China’s military, a move that has been condemned by Beijing. The companies to be delisted have the right to request a review of the NYSE’s decision. All three firms are listed in the US and Hong Kong, and mostly earn their revenue by providing voice and data services in China. They all have little presence in the US. Several other Chinese firms have already been removed from smaller US indices following the executive order. The order is considered to be a fresh attempt by the Trump administration to put pressure on China over what it views as Beijing’s unfair trade practices. Tensions between the world’s two largest economies have escalated in the past year over a broad range of issues including economics, geopolitics, China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and human rights. The White House has been seeking for several months to remove any reliance on China in the US telecommunications industry. In April, the Trump administration recommended that US regulators block China Telecom from operating in the US, warning that the China-backed company was creating national security and law enforcement risks for Washington. The US has voiced concerns that China Telecom could be vulnerable to exploitation, influence and control by the Chinese government.
The US government has previously placed severe restrictions on telecoms giant Huawei, and accused it of stealing trade secrets. In addition, Washington successfully put pressure on Britain to block Huawei from its 5G network. Telecoms firms are not the only ones in the US government’s sights. In a separate executive order signed in December, Trump also threatened to remove Chinese companies from US stock indices unless they comply with US auditing standards."
2021-01-01T13:00:51Z,business,Business,"Janet Yellen has made at least $7m from speaking fees, records show","The incoming US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has been paid at least $7m (£5.1m) for speaking engagements at government-regulated banks, consultancies and hedge funds over the past two years, according to newly disclosed documents. The former Federal Reserve chair disclosed a list of more than 50 paid speaking events for financial firms that included $67,500 from Goldman Sachs, $54,000 from an event at Barclays and $292,500 from a single speech for hedge fund Citadel. The documents were submitted to the US Office for Government Ethics as part of Yellen’s efforts to secure the top role at the US Treasury. While she has already been chosen for the post by the president-elect, Joe Biden, she still has to secure formal approval from the US Senate. The filings showed Yellen also earned $112,500 from a single speaking engagement with UBS, $225,000 from a speech for PwC and $270,000 from an event with the London-headquartered bank Standard Chartered. It is common for high-profile government officials such as Yellen to take paid speaking roles after retirement. Ben Bernanke, who served as chair of the US Federal Reserve before Yellen, reportedly earned about $250,000 for a single speech after leaving the central bank, where he earned $199,700 a year. However, Yellen – who earned just over $200,000 a year when she headed the US Fed between 2014 and 2018 – said she would get official permission before taking part in decisions involving any companies that had paid fees to her once she was formally appointed to the Treasury.
Yellen also promised to step down from the Australian investment firm Magellan Financial Group, from which she has earned $125,000 as a consultant and about $225,000 in speaking fees. She pledged to give up assets in 13 firms, including the telecoms giant AT&T, pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer and chemicals firm Dupont to avoid any conflict of interest. Similar filings from the current Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Hollywood film financier, before his appointment in 2017 did not reveal any significant speaking fees. However, Mnuchin promised to divest at least $94m worth of investments in 43 firms once he was appointed to Donald Trump’s cabinet. He was later criticised for failing to properly disclose he owned nearly $100m worth of real estate and held a directorship with offshore business vehicle based in the Cayman Islands, a tax haven."
2021-01-01T00:01:00Z,business,Business,From Laura Ashley to Debenhams: the biggest retail collapses of 2020,"2020 was a punishing year for the high street, with 177,000 jobs lost as a string of household names succumbed to administration during Covid-19. The pandemic has accelerated the painful restructuring of an industry that is a big employer but where fewer physical stores are needed to serve shoppers in the internet age. Here are some of the biggest retail collapses throughout 2020. Debenhams 1 December With no rescue deal agreed, the troubled chain started closing down sales in its 124 stores before Christmas, as it announced plans to liquidate. About 4,000 head office and store jobs have already gone as a result of its second administration in a year and its 12,000 remaining staff face an uncertain future. Arcadia 30 November The collapse into administration of Sir Philip Green’s fashion group affected 13,000 jobs. The Arcadia brands, which include Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins, are being auctioned off. So far only the plus-size label Evans has changed hands but all its outlets are to close, meaning hundreds of job losses. Arcadia had already cut 500 head-office jobs in the summer of 2020. Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group The fashion group, with 21,500 staff, owned by the entrepreneur Philip Day, fell into financial crisis in the autumn. Its brands – Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Ponden Mill, Peacocks, Jaeger, Austin Reed and Jacques Vert – followed each other into administration and it has cut 860 jobs so far. M&Co 5 August The Renfrewshire-based clothing retailer, formerly known as Mackays, was restructured via a pre-pack administration. The move resulted in the closure of 47 of 215 stores and 400 job losses. Harveys 30 June The furniture chain went under, with the administrators announcing an initial wave of 240 redundancies among its workforce of 1,500. TM Lewin 30 June The shirtmaker called in the administrators. It closed all 66 of its outlets permanently, with the loss of about 600 jobs. Monsoon Accessorize 11 June The fashion brands were bought out of administration by their founder, Peter Simon, in a deal that resulted in the closure of 35 stores and 545 job losses. Oasis and Warehouse 15 April All stores closed after the fashions brands went into administration, resulting in 1,800 job losses. The brands were subsequently sold to the online fashion group Boohoo.
Cath Kidston 21 April More than 900 jobs were cut at Cath Kidston’s retro retail label when a rescue deal brokered for the business closed all 60 of its UK stores. Laura Ashley 17 March The chain went into administration, with 2,700 job losses, after rescue talks were scuppered by the pandemic. It was acquired by the Gordon Brothers investment firm and is set to make a return through a partnership with Next."
2021-01-01T00:01:00Z,business,Business,"UK high street lost 177,000 jobs in 2020, study finds","The high street shed 177,000 jobs in 2020 according to a study that predicts an even more devastating toll on retail jobs this year, with a further 200,000 expected to be lost. The job losses in what is the UK’s biggest private employment sector – with particular importance for women – illustrate the dramatic and permanent impact the pandemic will have on the shopping landscape. The figure equates to 3,400 jobs lost every week in 2020, according to the new figures from the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) published on Friday. With Debenhams and Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia group among 2020’s high-profile casualties, the CRR described 2020 as one of the most troubled periods for the UK high street over the past 25 years.
About 15,700 stores closed their doors permanently, with Joshua Bamfield, the CRR’s director, predicting that up to 200,000 more jobs could disappear in 2021 as the big shift to online shopping during lockdown means yet more tough decisions about the future of stores. “Our forecast is based upon a number of factors such as the cumulative effects of months of closure and its impact upon cashflow and rent arrears that will be payable when the moratorium ends,” said Bamfield, “while the longer-term effects of the greater use by shoppers of all kinds of online retailing is likely to be hugely damaging for physical stores.” In 2020 half of employees working for retailers that went bust lost their jobs, which is a bigger proportion than during the 2008 recession, when it was about a third, said the CRR. The majority of the job losses were the result of store closures as independents shut and big chains scaled back their physical presence. In a sign of the times, the rescue deals brokered for the likes of Oasis, Warehouse and Cath Kidston jettisoned all their stores. The continued hollowing-out of the high street is eliminating entry-level retail jobs – positions such as sales assistant and checkout operator – which have traditionally been held by women, whereas jobs in growth areas related to e-commerce, such as van driving, are going more to men. The Fashion and Textile Children’s Trust (FTCT), a hardship charity that assists children whose parents work in the retail sector but are struggling to make ends meet, said it was “braced” for a flood of requests for help. During 2020, the number of inquiries for its grants increased by nearly 50% to 3,400. Anna Pangbourne, the FTCT’s director, said the charity had handed out a record amount of financial support during the health crisis, helping more than 1,000 children with grants totalling £520,000. “This year has been challenging for everyone, but has also shown how vulnerable some families are to sudden changes in financial circumstance, such as furlough or redundancy,” said Pangbourne. “We have heard from families who have had to choose between paying the rent or buying their children’s uniform for school.” In the wake of Debenhams slumping back into administration in April, the FTCT has given grants worth £48,000 to staff made redundant by the chain. Debenhams, which still employs 12,000 people, although many of them are furloughed, is in the middle of a closing down sale with a potential rescue by Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group the chain’s last hope. Pangbourne said most of the families it worked with were unable to save even when they were earning their full salary “so when faced with furlough, reduced pay or redundancy, they’ve had to make some very hard choices”. Its grants are for essentials such as domestic appliances, school uniforms and home learning kit. The total number of retail jobs lost in 2020 was up by almost a quarter on the 143,100 recorded for 2019. Last year Sainsbury’s, Marks & Spencer, Boots and John Lewis were among the major store groups to announce big job cuts.
Tightening restrictions on the back of rising coronavirus infection rates mean non-essential retail stores are now closed in three of the four home nations: Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The move to tier 4 rules has also shut two-thirds of English stores. Lost Christmas sales, coupled with the end of government emergency support, such as the business rates holiday, means retailers are facing tough financial decisions. Robert Hayton, head of property tax at real estate adviser Altus Group, said there was a “real risk” that some of the hundreds of thousands shops forced to close would not reopen."
2020-12-31T19:34:11Z,business,Business,City watchdog relaxes trading rules hours before Brexit,"The City’s financial regulator has relaxed rules on transactions with a daily value of billions of pounds, just hours before the UK officially left the EU’s single market. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on Thursday used temporary emergency powers to allow companies on both sides of the Channel to trade derivative contracts that are viewed as crucial for financial stability.
The last-minute adjustment came hours before the UK’s departure from the EU’s single market at 11pm GMT on New Year’s Eve. The move will allow banks and financial companies to trade derivatives known as swaps, which are contracts that allow companies to protect themselves against risks such as movements in interest or currency exchange rates. London is by far the biggest location for the derivatives trade in Europe. Before Brexit the UK’s financial firms had straightforward access to companies across the EU, but much of that access has been revoked, with some European politicians hopeful of attracting business away from London to cities such as Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt. Britain has urged Brussels to grant full two-way market access, known as “equivalence”, for swaps trading, but the bloc says it wants information from Britain about its intentions to diverge from EU rules before it can make a decision. The trade deal agreed between Boris Johnson’s government and Brussels on Christmas Eve does not cover financial services, meaning UK firms trying to serve EU clients will be reliant on the EU choosing to acknowledge UK regulation as equivalent.
The FCA on Thursday said the UK-based companies it regulates could instead use EU platforms, provided they do not have the option of using another location such as the US. That could result in more trading happening in the EU rather than London. The EU’s refusal to grant equivalence has come despite the hopes of the UK government and the FCA that an arrangement could be made before 1 January. The FCA said it “continues to view the agreement of mutual equivalence between the UK and EU as the best way to avoid disruption for market participants”, as well as avoiding companies having to trade on multiple venues which could potentially raise costs. The FCA said that it would review its approach by the end of March. The Bank of England previously warned that interest rate swaps worth about $200bn (£146bn) could be disrupted due to the clash between UK and EU swaps rules."

2020-12-31T15:42:49Z,business,Business,Primark says tier 4 extension will knock further £220m off sales,"Primark has said it will lose an additional £220m in sales as more stores are forced to close under new restrictions to control the spread of Covid-19 in the UK. The cut-price fashion chain’s owner, Associated British Foods, said it expected to lose £650m in sales in the year to September, up from the £430m it had announced on 4 December, after the government said major cities including Manchester and Birmingham must join London and the south-east of England in closing non-essential shops. Primark said 253 of its stores would now be temporarily closed from 1 January, just over two-thirds of its outlets globally. The update comes as retailers brace for further pain after the government announced that all of the north-east of England, Greater Manchester, large parts of the Midlands and the south-west would fall under the strictest tier 4 restrictions from Thursday morning. All of mainland Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are already under the tightest restrictions which involve the closure of hospitality and non-essential retail, which includes shops that sell clothing, toys, books and electrical goods. The restrictions have been widened in response to a new variant of Covid-19 that has contributed to a record rise in infections across the country. The number of shoppers out and about last week slumped by 46%, compared to the same period in 2019, according to the advisory firm BDO’s high street tracker. Online sales rose by 50% but that was not enough to offset the in-store decline. Total sales for established retailers fell 23%. Fashion sales were down just over a third. Primark takes a heavier hit from store closures than some rivals because it does not sell goods online. When the chain reopened in England earlier this month, however, after a month-long high street lockdown, the group said it saw “phenomenal” sales growth. Eleven stores stayed open overnight, resulting in a 40-hour trading marathon, and shoppers queued to get into the stores in the small hours of the morning."
2020-12-31T14:56:20Z,business,Business,"Year ends on low note as 787,000 more Americans file for unemployment","Another 787,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the week before Christmas, the last snapshot of 2020’s appalling jobs market before the New Year. Unemployment claims have been rising again in recent weeks to their highest levels since the autumn as surging coronavirus rates have slowed hiring and led to more layoffs. At current levels the weekly claims figures are almost four times their pre-pandemic average.
The latest weekly figure from the Department of Labor was 19,000 lower than the previous week’s 803,000 claims but the average number of claims over the last four weeks is now 836,750, more than the population of the city of Seattle. The national unemployment rate started the year at 3.6% in January and hit a record high of 14.7% in April as the coronavirus shut down much of the US economy. The unemployment rate has since declined dramatically, it was 6.7% in November, but the recovery has been uneven with women and black, Hispanic and young people still experiencing high levels of unemployment. The numbers of long-term unemployed are rising. The recent increases in weekly unemployment claims signal more trouble ahead. According to the Economic Policy Institute, 25.7 million workers in the US remain officially unemployed, otherwise out of work due to the pandemic, or have experienced a reduction in work hours or pay. After months of wrangling Congress has finally brokered a deal to extend unemployment assistance to the millions laid off during the pandemic. The $900bn Covid-19 relief bill will give those receiving unemployment benefits an extra $300 a week and extends two pandemic-specific programs used by about 14 million people. But the delay in the agreement means many across the country face delays in payments and more hardship. Fernando Comas of Secaucus, New Jersey, worked as a video engineer in the entertainment industry before the pandemic and has been furloughed since March until at least 2021. Six weeks ago, his benefits were exhausted. He has been unable to receive answers from his state unemployment agency to try to resolve the issue. “I have a family to feed, a mortgage to pay, a car payment, and I’m a single father of two small girls who rely on me to provide for them,” said Comas, who cannot afford to find other work because his family’s health coverage is still being covered by his employer. “I’m going to lose everything, probably going to be evicted and will start to go to the food banks for food for my family.”"
2020-12-31T12:16:11Z,business,Business,Countrywide accepts Connells' £130m takeover offer,"Connells has struck an agreed offer for Countryside, the owner of Hamptons International, after raising its bid to £130m, bringing together two of Britain’s biggest estate agency groups. The boards of Connells, which is part of Skipton building society, and Countrywide, the UK’s biggest listed estate agency group, said they had agreed terms of a recommended cash offer at 395p a share. Connells made an initial offer of 250p a share in early November and raised this to 325p a share a month later. The shares traded at 145p before the initial bid was made. The deal will bring together Countrywide’s 60 well-known high street brands, including Gascoigne-Pees, Bairstow Eves and King & Chasemore, with Connells’ 25 brands – Allen & Harris, Bagshaws Residential, Fox & Sons, and Barnard Marcus in London. Countrywide has 651 branches, while the Connells group has 581. The takeover is backed by the majority of Countrywide’s shareholders and is a lifeline for the business, which has struggled under debts of £91.9m and has been closing branches after years of mounting losses. The deal is expected to complete in the first three months of 2021. It scuppers a rival move made by the UK private equity firm Alchemy, a Countrywide shareholder which proposed a £90m cash injection into the firm in October in return for a controlling stake, and had the support of Peter Long, Countrywide’s executive chairman. Long quit in late November after opposition from shareholders to the plan, and the former William Hill boss Philip Bowcock was appointed chief executive. Before Alchemy’s move, LSL Property Services, which owns Your Move, abandoned a planned all-share merger with Countrywide in March. All of Countrywide’s lenders will be repaid in full, said Connells, pledging to invest in the group’s technology and branch network to turn the business around. It said there would be some job losses as the two head offices in Leighton Buzzard and Milton Keynes were merged, but vowed to retain staff in the branches. The offer is far below Countrywide’s £750m valuation when it floated on the stock market in March 2013 amid a buoyant property market. The company amassed debts when it went on an acquisition spree in 2014 and 2015, buying up high street brands at a time when others invested in online estate agency services. Long blamed its woes on the “completely wrong” strategy pursued by the former chief executive Alison Platt, who sought to run the estate agent like a retailer from a central base, triggering an exodus of middle management. David Livesey, Connells’ chief executive, said: “We have the right management team, strategy and investment firepower to work with the talented teams at Countrywide and lead Countrywide into a bright future.”
David Watson, the acting chairman of Countrywide, said: “Following a thorough evaluation of options and extensive consultation with the company’s major shareholders, we have been encouraged by their recognition of the need to put in place a sustainable capital structure and a willingness to support the company, which is a great business that has been constrained by too much debt.” The UK housing market has been surprisingly buoyant this year despite the Covid-19 pandemic. It ground to a halt for a few weeks during the first national lockdown but bounced back in the summer, helped by a stamp duty cut. Demand from buyers looking for bigger homes in leafy locations has surged as many office workers switched to working from home. But forecasters expect the market to cool next year, when the stamp duty cut expires, with unemployment expected to rise sharply."
2020-12-31T07:17:54Z,business,Business,"The UK's year in business: the winners, losers and bumper pay packets","It was an unprecedented year that none of us will forget. The coronavirus pandemic shook the world of business and economics to its core and continues to have profound, often unpredictable effects, some of them permanent. It hasn’t all been about Covid-19 though. 2020 also witnessed the usual corporate chicanery, deal-making and scandal. There were world-changing cultural and political moments, landmark departures and arrivals as well as, of course, some pocket-stretching pay packets. Here is a review of the year in business. The winners The shift to buying goods and services online accelerated during the pandemic. Any company that could deliver essential goods to the door or provide digital services became instantly indispensable. Supermarkets moved quickly to increase online delivery slots, and took on thousands of extra workers to help meet the additional demand. While whole segments of the economy shut down, supermarket tills rang non-stop. Morrison’s boss, David Potts, declared a “renaissance” of the supermarket and Tesco’s profits surged. Web-only pioneer Ocado proved a clear winner, with earnings nearly doubling and shares up about 80% since the beginning of the year. Amazonwas a big beneficiary as non-essential shops were forced to close and people stayed at home. Skyrocketing demand helped its founder-boss, Jeff Bezos, increase his net worthby $13bn (£10bn) in a single day to take his personal wealth to an unprecedented $189bn.. His workers didn’t fare quite so well. It was an even better year than normal to be a multi-billionaire, in fact. Ten of them increased their combined wealth by $400bn. Increased hygiene protocols paid off for Dettol-maker Reckitt Benckiser, although it did have to warn people against ingesting its disinfectant to combat Covid-19 after the US president Donald Trump floated the idea. The video-conferencing service Zoom emerged from relative obscurity to become a household name valued at about $100bn. “You’re on mute!” became a pandemic catchphrase. Online gambling companies ended 2020 worth more than they were at the beginning of the year. After an initial hit caused by the suspension of sports, bored punters flocked to online poker, roulette and slot machines. Many homebuyers were handed a boost, thanks to the chancellor’s stamp duty holiday. Other winners included some of those with political connections and contacts with a Chinese face mask supplier. Hundreds of millions of pounds of contracts were handed out, with next to no scrutiny, sparking allegations of cronyism. The losers Several industries are facing an existential threat, putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk. Hospitality has borne the brunt, prompting warnings that tens of thousands of pubs, restaurants, bars and hotels could disappear. Pub groups such as Marston’s and Greene King cut jobs, while the nightclub firm Deltic filed for administration. Worse could follow with the lucrative Christmas period ruined for many. The picture is similarly bleak in travel, tourism and leisure. By early October, more than 40 airlines had gone bust. Refused a government bailout, billionaire Sir Richard Branson had to prop up Virgin Atlantic with a £1.2bn rescue package, including £200m of his own money. EasyJet denied it faced collapse. British Airways lost a staggering £5bn in the first nine months of the year, while tour operator TUI announced losses of £1.8bn. In entertainment, Cineworld shut UK and US cinemas indefinitely, while many live music and theatre businesses face oblivion. Deserted high streets wreaked havoc on retailers, particularly those deemed non-essential, triggering a string of administrations. The billionaire Philip Green’s retail empire Arcadia collapsed into administration, as did Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Laura Ashley and Cath Kidston. And let’s not forget the estimated 3 million people, such as some self-employed, who have seen limited or no benefit from government measures to support businesses and jobs. It’s the economy, stupid!
This all made for some mind-blowing and unwelcome economic and financial milestones. As coronavirus paralysed the economy, UK GDP plunged by a previously unthinkable 20% in the second quarter, an all-time record. Government debt hit £2.1tn amid unprecedented peacetime borrowing. The Bank of England cut interest rates to a record low of 0.1%, while quantitative easing, in effect pumping money into the economy, reached £895bn. As global trade slowed, so did demand for oil, with mind-boggling results. The price of US oil briefly moved into negative territory, as traders paid to be rid of unwanted barrels rather than incur storage costs. In March there were a series of stomach-churning stock market crashes. The FTSE suffered the second worst day in its history, losing 10.9%. Wall Street suffered a similar fate, before staging a remarkable resurgence, thanks in part to booming tech stocks and support from the Federal Reserve. Heroes and reasons to be cheerful The pandemic allowed some businesses – and their staff in particular – to shine. Supermarket workers, cleaners and delivery drivers emerged as some of the true heroes of the crisis. In the early days, industrials rallied round in a wartime-style effort, with the likes of Airbus, Rolls-Royce and McLaren joining the Ventilator Challenge to produce thousands of medical ventilators that, thankfully, have not been needed in the quantities feared. Fashion firms including Burberry made PPE, while the likes of the chemicals firm Ineos and craft beer firm BrewDog churned out hand sanitiser. You don’t often hear three cheers for Big Pharma but the likes of Pfizer and AstraZeneca have won public goodwill thanks to swift work producing vaccines. Retailers paid back £1.8bn in state support that they did not need, including Sainsbury’s, Asda, B&M, Aldi, Tesco and Morrisons. Away from coronavirus, the Black Lives Matter movement led many businesses to engage more seriously with racial discrimination and inequality, but progress has been slow and critics have warned firms must wake up to race issues. Scandal and intrigue 2020 spawned tales of skulduggery worthy of the late John Le Carre. In January, fugitive former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn told of his dramatic escape from incarceration in Japan. Accused of financial misconduct, Ghosn was smuggled to Lebanon thanks to an elaborate plot that involved him hiding in an audio equipment box. Tidjane Thiam, one of the stars of banking, was ousted as boss of Swiss bank Credit Suisse after a saga involving corporate espionage, an alleged car chase and bitter personal vendettas. The payment processing firm Wirecard enjoyed the backing of the entire German financial establishment as it tried every trick in the book to discredit Financial Times reporters who eventually unmasked the company as a fraudulent house of cards. British firms played their part, too. Aston Martin was revealed to have close links to a “sock puppet” PR firm questioning the green credentials of electric vehicles. Then there was the furore over fast fashion firm Boohoo and its ties to garment factories in Leicester and Pakistan, where workers were allegedly underpaid and exposed to unsafe working conditions. The fallout from the collapse of London Capital & Finance, costing investors £236m, cast significant doubt on the efficacy of the financial watchdog, the FCA. Wheeling and dealing Covid-19 subdued merger and acquisition activity but the US graphics card specialist Nvidia swooped for Cambridge-based chipmaker Arm Holdings, in a $40bn deal that sparked concern about the future of a rare British tech world-leader. The ticket resale firm Viagogo announced a $4bn takeover of rival StubHub, only to see the British Competition & Markets Authority step in and threaten to scupper the whole thing. The deal hangs in the balance. After months of uncertainty, British Steel was eventually sold to the Chinese firm Jingye, securing the future of steelmaking in Scunthorpe.
As the UK considers a crackdown on gambling, the US is opening up. The Las Vegas casino firm Caesars grabbed William Hill with a £2.9bn takeover. Meanwhile, the Paddy Power owner, Flutter, completed a $12.3bn merger with Canada’s The Stars Group, creating the world’s largest online gambling company. As the year drew to a close, the security firm G4S accepted a £3.8bn offer from its US rival Allied Universal Security Services. Pay packets Tesla’s founder, Elon Musk, took the first steps on the road towards a controversial $55.8bn pay bonanza. It hinges on some tough targets, including Tesla reaching a market value of $650bn. The electric car firm zoomed through that barrier earlier this month following a remarkable and sustained rise. In the UK, Matthew Moulding, the chief executive of the e-commerce firm The Hut Group, was in line for £830m in performance-related shares thanks to its strong performance since listing. He claims to have made 74 staff millionaires too. Even before the pandemic boosted Ocado’s fortunes, its boss, Tim Steiner, scooped £54m in share price-related bonuses. Hello, goodbye
It’s hard to believe that Rishi Sunak only became chancellor of the exchequer in February. He was briefly flavour of the month when handing out more than £210bn in Covid relief to fund the furlough scheme and initiatives such as eat out to help out. His star has fallen a little since then and he faces the tough task of managing the finances during a recession. As Sunak arrived, the Bank of England governor Mark Carney bowed out after seven years overseeing a post-banking crisis British economy, with his reputation pretty much intact. Andrew Bailey succeeded him at Threadneedle Street. Sharon White became chair of John Lewis Partnership in February. Joining at a challenging time for the retail sector, White quickly made major decisions, including the closure of eight of its 50 department stores, including big outlets in Birmingham and Watford, with significant job losses. IAG’s boss Willie Walsh timed his exit to perfection, leaving the British Airways owner just as global aviation entered the biggest crisis in its history. As he retired, so did BA’s fleet of 747 jumbo jets. Speaking of goodbyes, there was the small matter of Britain bidding adieu to the European Union on 31 January 2020. Sadly, the tourism world said goodbye to John Hays, of travel agency Hays Travel. He and wife Irene stepped in to rescue the Thomas Cook stores in 2019."
2020-12-31T06:00:32Z,business,Business,Sector by sector: are British firms ready for post-Brexit trade?,"After months of tortuous negotiations between the UK and the EU, a Brexit trade deal was agreed at almost the last minute. But how prepared are UK businesses for the significant changes that will come into force on 1 January? Are they happy with the terms of the agreement? Retail A shock rise in high street prices caused by billions of pounds of new import taxes on everyday goods has been avoided thanks to the new trade deal. Four-fifths of UK food imports come from the EU, and the British Retail Consortium has told shoppers they can heave a “collective sigh of relief”. Retail Economics’ chief executive, Richard Lim, said: “Two weeks ago there was a risk that Brexit could be catastrophic. The deal has provided certainty in terms of what retailers need to do. What we are facing now is at the lower end of the scale in terms of the potential for disruption.” John Allan, the chairman of Tesco, who had warned that import tariffs would have triggered higher food prices, said he was now “relatively calm” about the impact of Brexit on retail, and food retail in particular. But he cautioned: “If we don’t do something very positive to counteract it in terms of the national economy in the long run, we will be a bit worse off than we would have been if we’d stayed in the EU.” Zoe Wood Ports
The chaos caused by last week’s French travel ban, which left thousands of truckers stranded in Kent and supermarkets flying in fresh fruit and vegetables, means we have already seen what the worst-case scenario for 1 January could look like. Could those scenes be repeated? The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has already predicted “bumpy moments” for companies navigating the new customs procedures, and analysts think tailbacks at the ports are inevitable in the early days. However, the government’s decision to temporarily waive most of its border checks takes some of the pressure off. The initial focus is on imports of “controlled” goods such as alcohol and tobacco, but controls will ratchet up in April and again in July. After the frenetic stockpiling before Christmas and the Brexit deadline, the volume of goods moved in January is lower, which will also help if there are hiccups with new systems. But any disruption to the flow of cross-Channel trade caused by new Brexit bureaucracy would soon be felt on British shores. With 3,500 trucks a day using the Channel tunnel, the Eurotunnel terminal is an obvious bottleneck if businesses struggle with new customs paperwork. Border delays would be disastrous for exporters of perishable goods, such as Scottish seafood, which were badly hit last week. ZW Logistics Given that UK haulage companies had feared having to fight over a small number of annual permits to carry on sending lorries across the Channel, for most the agreement is a significant improvement on the no-deal scenario. However, their operations will be constrained in terms of cabotage (ie moving goods within an EU country) and cross-border deliveries within the EU. That could pose a headache for some, and could prove insurmountable for specialist companies providing logistics for events such as music tours through several countries. The deal still means an enormous amount of red tape for customs and borders, and while the haulage sector itself will not be responsible, lorries could be held up or stopped if their importing/exporting companies have not got the new paperwork correct.

Drugmakers have long been preparing for Brexit by stockpiling more medicines to ensure there are no shortages of vital drugs and by planning alternative supply routes away from the busy Dover to Calais straits. The industry is confident that medicines will reach patients come 1 January and beyond, but says some things are out of its control, such as delays at borders due to new customs and border checks. Under the Brexit deal, inspections of drug manufacturing facilities are recognised by both sides, but the text does not mention mutual recognition of medicine batch testing. Additional safety tests on medicines made in the UK before they are sold in the EU and vice versa would lead to delays of several weeks. For Northern Ireland, the UK and EU have agreed a one-year phase-in period to implement medicines regulation. Julia Kollewe Aviation UK airlines had long been resigned to losing some of their freedoms to operate throughout Europe, such as flying between two EU member states, with easyJet having already hived off part of its operations into a new company in Austria to tackle potential losses from its route network. Meanwhile, contingency measures had guaranteed that flights could continue between the UK and EU in the event of no deal. The structure of International Airlines Group, the Madrid-based owner of British Airways, was questioned before the deal. A clause now allows UK carriers to be controlled by a combination of EU and UK shareholders, which should avert any obligation for BA or other airlines to be split off from owning groups or for shareholders to divest. GT The City
While the Brexit deal says very little about financial services, it has been broadly welcomed by City firms whose business borrowers and corporate clients could have suffered from tariffs and quotas on cross-border trade. But industry groups including UK Finance are calling for an equivalence agreement on financial services – which would give similar access rights to City firms after the end of the transition period – as soon as possible. The lobby group TheCityUK has said that while there are agreements covering basic banking transactions, there are up to 40 treaties affecting cross-border activities for the financial industry that need to be renegotiated. However, reports suggest an agreement on equivalence may not come until spring or summer 2021. TheCityUK’s boss, Miles Celic, said: “While a deal is welcome, financial and related professional services are clear-eyed about the need for both sides to continue to develop the relationship in services in the years ahead.” Most City firms – investment banks, asset managers and insurers – had not expected a deal covering financial services to be struck before the transition deadline, and prepared accordingly. Firms have spent the last four years applying for licences with local regulators, revising client contracts, and shifting more than 7,500 roles and a combined £1.2tn in assets to the EU, to ensure they could continue serving continental customers by the time the UK left the bloc. However, areas that have not yet been granted equivalence, such as derivatives trading, are facing disruption despite the deal. Traders and brokers will have to make alternative arrangements, bypassing the London market to use derivatives trading platforms in countries such as the US that have already been granted equivalence. If traders and brokers get used to rerouting their business through different countries, it could threaten London’s dominance as a financial centre, and make trading less efficient and more costly for users. Kalyeena Makortoff Manufacturing UK manufacturing firms were overwhelmingly in favour of a deal that avoided tariffs and quotas that would have destroyed the business models of many companies importing or exporting materials, parts or goods from Europe. However, new customs and rules of origin checks at the border mean parts will be slower to enter the UK, which in turn means carefully planned “just-in-time” supply chains for companies will have to cope with longer import times, adding billions of pounds of extra customs costs for EU and UK businesses. Manufacturers have called for a significant adjustment period to allow them to continue to trade freely while they adjust to the new rules. One of the trickiest issues for advanced manufacturers is around complex rules of origin. For instance, Japan’s Nissan or Toyota will only be able to source 45% of their car parts from Asia to avoid tariffs. However, the deal means parts sourced from the EU and vice versa will not be affected, and there will be leeway with electric car batteries until 2023. Jasper Jolly Energy
The trade deal’s energy chapters have a notable emphasis on the climate crisis, including commitments on using more renewables and avoiding a race to the bottom on climate regulations. In fact, the trade deal could be suspended entirely if either side reneges on the 2015 Paris agreement. The deal includes a new commitment for both sides to work together in the North Sea on big offshore windfarms linked to both the UK and the EU. However, there are large gaps remaining on how exactly existing trade in gas and electricity across interconnectors will work, with only a commitment to sort technical details by 2022. The energy industry is particularly keen for the deal’s parallel UK and EU carbon pricing schemes to be joined together, which it says would avoid extra costs. Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of the lobby group Energy UK, said that agreeing to link carbon markets in 2021 would be “a great demonstration of collaboration on decarbonisation” before the UK hosts the Cop26 climate talks in the autumn. On nuclear power, the UK and the EU have agreed to continue cooperating, including on the safe movement of nuclear material, equipment and waste. The UK will still be part of various nuclear research programmes. And as with many parts of the deal, the agreement heralds the start of rolling negotiations: the energy chapter will cease to apply in June 2026 – potentially a worry for investors looking at the big energy projects that will be needed to reduce carbon emissions to net zero. JJ Fishing Taking back control of the UK’s waters was a rallying cry for the Brexit campaign, even if fishing’s contribution to the UK and EU economies is small relative to other sectors. The deal transfers 25% of the value of fish caught by EU boats in UK waters back to the UK over five years – considerably less than the 80% originally demanded by the UK. UK vessels will catch about two-thirds of fish caught in UK waters, but EU boats will be able to operate as close as six miles from the UK’s coast. Fishers’ lobby groups were aghast that the deal will end the practice of quota swapping between British and EU vessels, meaning that in some cases UK fishers may be limited to smaller catches. And the deal is by no means an end point: instead, the EU and the UK will conduct annual negotiations on catch size. Some UK fishers hope the UK will continue to push for further increases in their catch. JJ"
2020-12-31T06:00:32Z,business,Business,British businesses on preparing for Brexit: 'It’s been a bit of a debacle',"Brandauer, Birmingham “If I see another advert telling me ‘are you ready for Brexit?’ I’ll throw my telly out of the window. It’s just ridiculous and insulting to businesses,” said Rowan Crozier, chief executive of Birmingham-based metalworking company Brandauer. “It’s been a bit of a debacle this year on more than one front in terms of being ready for it,” he said of the government’s handling of Brexit preparations. “The expectation on business to just adopt whatever happens is just unrealistic, particularly in a year when we have to deal with pandemic.”
For the 148-year-old company which makes precision-engineered metal products including car parts, electrical items and nose clips for face masks, repeat conference calls with EU clients have helped, as has its experience of trading in 22 markets around the world. But while the Brexit deal has come as a relief, Crozier expects it will take time for the UK and EU to adapt. Fearing there will still be some disruption in January, he said more cooperation will be needed long after the ink on the Brexit deal dries. Pointing to the 48-hour ban on UK freight by France amid Covid-19 concerns, he said: “The referendum was won on taking back control of borders. But that’s only ever one side, isn’t it? If the French choose to stop it moving, then this is a clear demonstration we haven’t got control. We can only ever have 50%.” Addmaster, Stafford The Brexit trade deal came as a big relief to Paul Morris, the chief executive of Addmaster. As a manufacturer of antibacterial coatings for shopping bags and trolleys, business has boomed during the Covid pandemic for the Stafford-based company. But the prospect of tariffs and border disruption could have hit the company hard. “It’s been terrible timing for something that has unnerved businesses, but I’m really happy we’ve got a deal that doesn’t involve tariffs,” said Morris, who has been awarded an MBE in the Queen’s new year honours list for his firm’s services to exporting.
Morris said ministers leaving the deal to the last minute made it almost impossible for firms to prepare. “We couldn’t prepare for it, we didn’t know what to plan for. Literally I had customers and orders for raw materials coming in January and had no idea what it was going to cost.” Addmaster stockpiled supplies and started a dormant company in Ireland in case of a need to move out of the UK to avoid tariffs. “Now it appears to be tariff free. That has allayed a lot of my fears,” he said."
