2021-03-03T11:00:15Z,technology,Technology,'Facebook has a blind spot': why Spanish-language misinformation is flourishing ,"In the last year, Facebook adjusted some of the most fundamental rules about what gets posted on its platform, halting algorithmic recommendations of political groups, banning lies about vaccines and removing a number of high-profile figures for spreading misinformation and hate – including Donald Trump.
But researchers say the social media platform is not enforcing those policies as effectively when it comes to misinformation in Spanish – a blind spot that may prove deadly as health lies spread through the most vulnerable populations during the global vaccine effort. “Prior to the election, Facebook was rolling out new enforcement actions and policy updates week after week,” said Carmen Scurato, a senior policy counsel at the civil rights group Free Press who studies Spanish-language misinformation. “But what we are observing is that those enforcement actions don’t seem to be replicated in Spanish.” A spokesman from Facebook said that its policies do apply to English and Spanish content. “Although before the election we saw Facebook make an effort to take down some disinformation, we did not see that same effort on Spanish content,” echoed Jacobo Licona, the disinformation research lead for Equis Labs, a polling firm focused on Latino voters. “It’s disappointing, and could have a negative impact on Spanish-speaking communities.” There are more than 59 million Spanish speakers in the US, and the demographic is growing on Facebook. According to Facebook’s own market research data, more than 70% of Latinos who use social media prefer Facebook over other online platforms.
But Spanish-language content is less often and less quickly moderated for misinformation and violence than English content, research shows. While 70% of misinformation in English on Facebook ends up flagged with warning labels, just 30% of comparable misinformation in Spanish is flagged, according to a study from the human rights non-profit Avaaz. “Facebook is leaving out the millions of people who speak Spanish at home by failing to apply its community standards equally,” Scurato said. “If you say you are making efforts on your platform for the safety and health of all of us, that has to also include the Latinx community.” The impact of misinformation Most misinformation on Facebook today falls into one of two categories: politics, on the one hand, and health and vaccines on the other. Studies found that political misinformation in Spanish on Facebook-owned platforms ran rampant around the 2020 presidential election, remained online longer and spread more widely than similar posts in English. In September, two months before the vote, the US representatives Debbie Mucarsel-Powell of Florida and Joaquin Castro of Texas asked the FBI to investigate disinformation targeting Latinos in Florida, citing a surge in social media posts with “false or misleading information”. Another Avaaz study, published in October 2020, found that more than half of Spanish-speaking voters in Florida had seen misinformation on Facebook in the days leading up to the elections. It is difficult to quantify just how impactful the spread of misinformation surrounding the elections was on the Latino vote, but in some Latino strongholds, support for Joe Biden was significantly lower than expected. Today, the most prevalent topic for misinformation in Spanish on Facebook is health and vaccine related. In early February, Facebook renewed its efforts to crack down on vaccine misinformation, banning all posts with false claims about vaccines from the platform, whether it is about the Covid-19 vaccine or vaccines in general. Before that, a third study from Avaaz published in August 2020 found that health misinformation in general on Facebook had gotten 3.8bn views in the previous year, including dozens of Spanish posts with millions of views sharing baseless misinformation such as claims the vaccine contains a microchip to track recipients, that it will alter human DNA and that it was developed by Bill Gates.
Such theories have been cited by many eligible Latino frontline workers in Chicago as reasons they did not want to get vaccinated, said Geraldine Luna, the medical director of the city’s department of public health. Officials there were “very concerned” to see just 18% of eligible Latino and Black residents agreeing to get the vaccine at the beginning of the rollout, she said, adding that health officials have now gotten that number up substantially after weeks of countering misinformation with public health campaigns. Luna noted that historically, many of the populations most affected by these conspiracy theories have been mistreated by medical and public health establishments, creating a vacuum in which misinformation thrives. “There has been a lot of work to get the right information to the right people and address that history of trauma,” Luna said. Even though Latinos living in the US are disproportionately affected by Covid-19, a recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that only 26% of Latinos said they would get the vaccine as soon as possible, compared to 40% of whites. “What we are seeing is that a lot of essential workers do not want to get vaccinated because they fear they will be tracked or deported based on information and conspiracy theories they have seen online,” said Oscar Soria, a misinformation researcher at Avaaz. Why is Spanish-language misinformation spreading? There are several reasons Spanish misinformation continues to spread on Facebook more widely than English misinformation, researchers say. The company, they say, does not dedicate enough resources to Spanish-language moderation, which includes a failure to hire enough Spanish-speaking workers. Non-human content moderation tools like artificial intelligence may not pick up on the nuance in Spanish. Facebook appears to be dedicating fewer resources to moderating Spanish content on its platforms than it does for misinformation in English, said Jessica J González, the co-founder of Change the Terms and co-chief executive officer of Free Press, adding that the company has repeatedly been unwilling or unable to answer her questions regarding the size and scope of its Spanish-language moderation teams. “This is the fourth most spoken language in the world and the second most spoken language in the US – you have an obligation to dedicate resources to it,” González said.
González noted the importance of a robust and diverse Spanish-speaking moderation force. Spanish is spoken in more than 20 countries globally, each with its own slang and interpretations of words and phrases. She recalled a time when her organization was filing a complaint to the FCC unrelated to Facebook with colleagues from Mexico, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Puerto Rico. “We debated for almost a full day what one sentence in Spanish meant, based on our varied understanding of a couple different words and phrases in that sentence that translated in different ways depending on country of origin,” she said. Moderation efforts face other challenges. Soria said often there was a higher volume of misinformation being spread by video than by text, making it more difficult for AI to quickly spot. In one example cited by Avaaz in the October 2020 study, it took 22 days for Facebook to label a misinformation video in Spanish falsely claiming that the Covid-19 virus was deliberately created in a lab in China. By that time, the video had reached 33m views. It took nine days for the video to be factchecked by a Facebook partner and then another 13 days for the video to be labelled by Facebook as misinformation. Facebook’s failures to moderate in Spanish also reflect a top-down diversity problem many tech companies face, said González. As of 2019, just 5% of Facebook’s workforce was Latino, according to the company’s yearly diversity report. Facebook accused of leaning on non-profits When reached for comment, Facebook would not say what percentage of its budget it dedicates to content moderation or what portion of that is dedicated to Spanish-language moderation in particular. A spokesman said Facebook in the last several years has tripled the number of people working on safety and security for the platform. It now has a team of 35,000, of whom about 15,000 are content reviewers who review content at more than 20 global sites. He added that Facebook has 13 partners in its factchecking network that review Spanish-language content. English-language partners include publications such as USA Today. “We are taking aggressive steps to fight harmful Covid-19 misinformation on our platforms in dozens of languages, including Spanish,” he said. “We’ve removed millions of pieces of content that could lead to imminent harm under our policies.” Scurato said Facebook has asked her and others at non-profit organizations to continue to flag misinformation found in their studies. In response, dozens of human rights and Latino advocacy groups have written to Facebook urging it to address its own problems: “Not only does this deplete valuable resources that should be dedicated to directly advocating for and providing services to our community, it is also an exhausting exercise in microaggression pain points of our position and power in the systemically inequitable US tech industry,” they wrote in November. The groups say Facebook still has not removed a number of Spanish-language posts flagged in the letter exhibiting clear violations of Facebook’s policies on hate speech and misinformation, including calls to build militias and health misinformation. The problem is not hopeless, however, said Soria, the Avaaz researcher. His organization and others have called on Facebook to not only devote more resources to the issue, but to address the misinformation problem by correcting falsehoods that have spread on the app, potentially sending notifications to users who were exposed to false information. Studies have shown such corrections work, decreasing belief in disinformation by nearly 50%. “The bottom line is that Facebook has a blind spot when it comes to Spanish-language misinformation,” Soria said. “But it can and should be fixed. Facebook needs to say ‘basta’ to the spread of misinformation on the platform.”"
2021-03-03T07:00:11Z,technology,Technology,Fitbit Sense review: a good smartwatch that fails on sustainability,"Fitbit is attempting to challenge the dominance of the Apple Watch with the Sense: a smartwatch packed with advanced health sensors for stress, heart rate and ECG wrapped up in a neat and tidy package. But be careful, because if you damage the watch, it appears you can’t even pay Fitbit to fix it. It costs £300 and is Fitbit’s top model above the £200 Versa 3, which is essentially the same smartwatch without the advanced sensors, plus a cheaper line of fitness trackers. The watch measures just 40.5mm across and 12.35mm thick, making it one of the smallest smartwatches available. The 1.58in OLED display is bright and surrounded by a polished stainless steel bezel that forms part of the electrical connections for the sensors. The rest of the body is aluminium.
The screen can be set to always show the time and other data, or to light up on turning your wrist or pressing the button in the side of the watch. You cannot wake it up by tapping the screen, which I found annoying. There are hundreds of watch faces available from Fitbit and third parties, which you can download using the Fitbit app on your phone. Specifications Screen: 1.58in OLED Case size: 40.5mm Case thickness: 12.35mm Weight: 45.9g Operating system: Fitbit OS 5.1 Water resistance: IP68, 50 metres (5ATM) Sensors: gyro, HR sensor, ECG, EDA, blood oxygen, light, GPS+GLONASS, altimeter, skin temperature Connectivity: Bluetooth 5, wifi n, NFC, speaker, mic Battery life and connectivity
The battery can last up to six days between charges, but lasts more like two with the screen on all the time, calls and notifications turned on, and using some of the more advanced health monitoring features. I had to charge it before bed every other night with everything turned on, running a couple of times a week, tracking walks and my sleep. A 26-minute run with the screen on and GPS active consumed 6% of the battery, meaning it should last the length of a marathon or so. The watch connects to the Fitbit app on your Android or iPhone via Bluetooth, but also has wifi for downloading updates, apps and similar. Sustainability Despite publishing a sustainability statement, Fitbit declined to answer any of the Guardian’s sustainability questions, including on the use of recycled materials, whether the watch is repairable and the costs to do so out of warranty, and battery lifespan, losing it a star. Batteries in other smartwatches typically last for at least 500 cycles while maintaining at least 80% of their original capacity.
The Sense was awarded five out 10 for repairability by repair specialists iFixit, but Fitbit does not appear to offer any out-of-warranty repair services, such as those for broken screens or battery replacement, also losing it a star. It ships with a charging cable, but not a power adaptor. Fitbit has recently been bought by Google, which has made significant progress on sustainability, so hopefully Fitbit will improve in this area. Fitbit OS 5.1
Fitbit’s software is fairly slick. Swipe down from the top for smartphone notifications, up for widgets including health stats and the weather, left for apps and right for quick settings. Press the side button once to return to the watch face, or twice to access four quick shortcuts for music, apps and other functions. Press and hold it to invoke Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant for voice queries, timers and other functions, which are responsive as long as the watch has a good connection to your phone. Notifications from your phone are fairly basic, showing texts and alerts, but no images from chats, smart cameras or similar. You can reply to messages with canned responses or voice dictation on Android, but not if used with an iPhone. Music controls do not automatically appear and are somewhat cumbersome to get to: double-press the side button and tap the music shortcut to control playback, volume and other functions. The Spotify app is only a remote and cannot store or play music directly. Deezer or Pandora in the US can download tracks and play them via Bluetooth headphones. The watch has Fitbit Pay for contactless payments, but the number of UK banks that support it is very slim. Daily health
The Sense is packed with health and fitness features. It records your heart rate every five seconds, counts steps and active time, and has automatically adjusting high and low heart rate alerts, move reminders and daily activity goals. It also has advanced sleep monitoring, recording an overall “sleep score”, various sleep cycles, heart rate variability, skin temperature, breathing rate and blood oxygen saturation. A smart alarm function wakes you up at the optimum time in your cycle, too. One of the key features is the electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor, which records the rhythm of your heartbeat and works just as well as rivals, useful for keeping an eye out for early warning signs of heart trouble. The other is the electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor, which detects changes in the sweat level of your palm to measure stress levels in addition to data on stress interpreted from heart rate and sleep. The idea is sound but it requires you to place your palm for two minutes each time you want to record it – not something I’m going to do regularly. Guided mindfulness sessions use the EDA sensor too, but I didn’t feel any more relaxed than after doing some basic breathing exercises. It could be useful for keeping more empirical records of stress levels if you’re particularly worried. Workouts
On top of general health and activity monitoring, the Sense can track and record 20 different exercises, including the usual walking, running, swimming and cycling, yoga, circuit training, golf, tennis and others. The watch can automatically track many of the more vigorous activities taking more than 15 minutes in length, including walking and running: this records time, heart rate, calories burned, steps and other bits, but doesn’t activate the GPS for a route map. Manually recording the activity adds distance, pace, laps and a GPS map of the route where applicable. For running, the Sense gets a GPS lock in about 30 seconds. Its heart rate data varies slightly to that produced by a Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar or Apple Watch Series 6, but reached similar averages. The distance and pace of routes run along straight roads appeared accurate, but recordings for routes around parks or with many different corners were shorter than competitors by as much as 200m over 5km, which is disappointing. The Sense also doesn’t record or display cadence or any other more advanced running dynamics information, either. Much of Fitbit’s goals are based on heart rate zones, where more intense exercise begets more “zone minutes”, which are effectively exercise points towards your daily goal. It is an easy to understand scheme and more motivating than using just steps as a metric for success. Fitbit Coach provides guided exercises, too, which vary from basic running or walking plans to mindfulness and diet habit-building schemes. Fitbit differs from competitors in requiring an additional £7.99-per-month premium subscription for many of the advanced tracking and analysis features. These include analysis of duration, heart rate and restlessness of sleep and the health metrics dashboard in the app showing skin temperature, heart rate variability and breathing rate. Fitbit premium also adds features based around guided workouts, plans and challenges, where you can link up and compete with other Fitbit users. Observations
You need to routinely open the Fitbit app on an iPhone to keep it from being shut in the background and stopping things such as weather from updating on the watch. The charging cable is annoyingly short, at just 52.5cm. The Sense comes with a six-month free trial of Fitbit premium for new customers. Price The Fitbit Sense costs £299.99 and is available in black or gold. For comparison, the RRP for the Fitbit Versa 3 is £199.99, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 costs £199 and the Apple Watch Series 6 costs £379. Verdict The Fitbit Sense is a solid smartwatch with a good screen, a relatively slim design, two day-plus battery life, solid Google Assistant or Alexa integration and simple smartphone alerts. It has many advanced health sensors, including ECG for heartbeat rhythm and EDA for stress monitoring, and good sleep and daily activity tracking. But some of the features and analysis require a £7.99-a-month subscription to access, which is irritating for a £300 device. Automatic and manual workout tracking is solid, but the watch lacks more advanced metrics offered by rivals such as cadence for running and has issues with GPS accuracy on curvy or circular routes. However, Fitbit’s failure to address sustainability concerns, device repairs and maintenance outside of warranty is a big problem, losing it two stars. If you smash the screen or the battery wears out, you’re on your own; users report that you simply can’t pay Fitbit to fix the watch, making it an expensive disposable item, which is a real shame. Pros: good screen, responsive, slim design, extensive health tracking, ECG, good basic workout tracking, GPS, good activity motivation, Google Assistant/Alexa, solid smartwatch battery life. Cons: not sustainable, no OOW repair options, proprietary straps, issues with GPS accuracy, no advanced workout tracking, some health-tracking features require additional monthly subscription, short charging cable.

2021-03-02T19:21:49Z,technology,Technology,Alan Rusbridger says Oversight Board will ask to see Facebook's algorithm,"Facebook’s Oversight Board is trying to gain access to the social network’s curation algorithm to understand how it works, according to Alan Rusbridger, the former editor of the Guardian and a member of the quasi-independent body. Rusbridger, who is one of 20 founding members of the Oversight Board, said the body intended to broaden its remit beyond simply assessing Facebook’s decisions to remove or retain content. “We’re already a bit frustrated by just saying ‘take it down’ or ‘leave it up’,” Rusbridger told the House of Lords communications and digital committee on Tuesday. “What happens if you want to make something less viral? What happens if you want to put up an interstitial? What happens if, without commenting on any high-profile current cases, you didn’t want to ban someone for life but wanted to put them in a ‘sin bin’ so that if they misbehave again you can chuck them off? “These are all things that the board may ask Facebook for in time. But we have to get our feet under the table first, and prove that we can do what we want. At some point we’re going to ask to see the algorithm, I feel sure, whatever that means. Whether we’ll understand when we see it is a different matter.” Before the board would be able to examine the Facebook algorithm, Rusbridger suggested it would need to expand its numbers. Facebook selected the first 20 members, in conjunction with four co-chairs directly appointed by the social network. Now the board is in the process of finding another 20 board members without Facebook’s direct involvement. “I think we need more technology people on the board who can give us independent advice from Facebook. Because it is going to be a very difficult thing to understand how this artificial intelligence works,” Rusbridger said. “People say to me, ‘Oh, you’re on the board, but it’s well known that the algorithms reward emotional content that polarises communities because that makes it more addictive.’ Well I don’t know if that’s true or not, and as a board we’re going to have to get to grips with that. Even if that takes many sessions with coders talking very slowly so that we understand them, I think we need to understand what these machines are.” Appearing alongside Rusbridger was legal academic Kate Klonick, who shadowed the board as it was set up. “The reason we’re talking about content moderation right now is that it’s started to happen to powerful people,” Klonick told the committee. “We hear so much about Donald Trump and about high-profile actors that have been censored by Facebook, but there are thousands of people whose accounts have been taken down and the board is their last source to get it back from Facebook. “When you decide to take down someone’s entire account, and to ban their speech, you really deprive them of their right to association and their right to live their lives.”"
2021-03-01T23:05:17Z,technology,Technology,Twitter targets Covid vaccine misinformation with labels and 'strike' system,"Twitter is expanding its use of warning labels on tweets that contain misleading details about coronavirus vaccines.
The move, announced in a blogpost on Monday, is designed to strengthen the social network’s existing Covid-19 guidance, which has led to the removal of more than 8,400 tweets and challenged 11.5m accounts worldwide. In December the platform started providing more labels providing additional context to tweets with disputed information about the pandemic. Now the company is increasing its focus on posts about vaccines specifically, and starting a strike system that “determines when further enforcement action is necessary”. Twitter’s decision comes amid concern about the spread of anti-vaccination material on social media. Labels will initially be enforced by humans only, which will help automated systems pick up on violating content going forward. Users will face no additional action after their first strike. Two strikes will lead to a 12-hour account lock, with a further 12 hours added for a third offense. A seven-day account lock will be imposed after four strikes, followed by a permanent suspension for five or more strikes. The company is starting with English-language content and says it will work to expand to other languages and cultural contexts over time. “We believe the strike system will help to educate the public on our policies and further reduce the spread of potentially harmful and misleading information on Twitter, particularly for repeated moderate and high-severity violations of our rules,” the company said. The change was a “move in the right direction”, said Lisa Fazio, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University who studies the psychology of fake news. “As always, the devil is in the details,” she said. “The success of the policy will depend on how consistently it is applied, how accurately it is applied, and how well the appeals process works.” Facebook, for example, enacted specific regulations on topics including political and vaccine misinformation but was criticized for how it actually acted on that rule, with some accusing the company of refusing to take action on conservative misinformation to avoid being seen as politically biased. Under the new policy, users cannot report other users specifically for Covid misinformation, despite that type of content being banned on the platform. Instead, users who think a particular tweet breaks the company’s rules on Covid must report it for another offense – such as “threatening harm” – and use the text box to add that it is banned misinformation. The new Twitter policies come after Facebook banned vaccine misinformation entirely in early February, using a similar strike system that suspends users who post false claims and permanently removes those with multiple violations. Facebook is specifically targeting pages and groups with the new guidelines, which are not specific to Covid-related content and will also target falsehoods including suggesting vaccines cause autism – a baseless claim made by many in the anti-vax community. Twitter, Facebook, and platforms such as Instagram and TikTok began adding links and labels to any information about Covid-19 early in the pandemic. On Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, posting even the term “Covid-19” will get a post accompanied by a warning label and a link to accurate information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The prevalence of misinformation and how it is handled on these platforms underscores the outsized influence the massive private companies have on public health issues, democracy, and decisions around free speech, said Gautam Hans, director of the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt University. “We should have some democratic concerns about how these private companies have so much control to allow speech to happen or not without any kind of real democratic accountability, and the ways in which current First Amendment doctrine stymies much legislation or regulation on this front,” Hans said."
2021-03-01T22:07:16Z,technology,Technology,Zoom sees revenues soar 326% year-over-year as office life remains on hold,"A year of working from home may have driven many of us to the brink but it’s been great news for Zoom, the video conferencing business. On Monday, the company announced its revenues had soared 326% year-over-year to $2.6bn and there was little sign of slowing at the end of the year. Sales soared 369% in the last quarter to $882.5m.
“We are humbled by our role as a trusted partner and an engine for the modern work-from-anywhere environment. Our ability to rapidly respond and execute drove strong financial results throughout the year,” said Eric Yuan, founder and CEO of Zoom. The nine-year-old company has become synonymous with video conferencing during the pandemic. While many now speak of Zoom fatigue, the coronavirus is continuing to spread and traditional office life is still on hold for many. Zoom expects the shift to continue well into 2021. In the first three months of this year, the company said, it expected to generate revenues of between $900m and $905m, well above analysts’ estimates. Workers and students are expected to return to their physical spaces in the near future as vaccine supplies grow and the spread of the virus slows, a prospect that has worried some Zoom investors. But there are signs that the coronavirus may have a lasting impact on office life. According to a Pew Research report, before the pandemic, only one in five workers who said their job responsibilities could mainly be done from home worked from home all or most of the time. Now, 71% of those workers are doing their job from home all or most of the time and more than half want to keep working from home even after the pandemic. In the UK, seven in 10 employees who have been working remotely told a survey by Boston Consulting Group that they felt as productive at home as in the workplace. Whether the trend will prove resilient enough for Zoom to continue its astronomical growth remains to be seen. “Zoom’s growth has been remarkable to watch. In under a year, the video conference platform has united a socially distanced world and become the defining app of the coronavirus era. However, with the vaccine programme in full swing and end of the pandemic in sight, Zoom’s growth over the past year could be hard to sustain,” said Rebecca Bezzina, managing director at the digital agency R/GA London."
2021-03-01T22:05:58Z,technology,Technology,Apply liberally: the TikTok teens fighting political battles with makeup,"If youâ€™re on TikTok, youâ€™ll know Gen Z can tell if youâ€™re a millennial from a side part and skinny jeans. Now, a new TikTok trend suggests teenagers on the app know someoneâ€™s political standing from the way they use eyeliner. Dubbed the â€œRepublican-sonaâ€� makeover, Gen Z is creating their â€œconservative alter egosâ€� to the ironic soundtrack of â€œGod Made Girlsâ€� by RaeLynn.
According to the trend, which started as a way to lightheartedly mock conservatives, Republicans overuse an orange foundation shade, powder their face, conceal their lips and apply thick eyeliner. The makeovers have been adapted into a masc version and a fake couple edition, where two friends created Melissa and Tanner, their mask-avoiding, engaged, alter egos.
While the videos are clearly poking fun at poorly applied makeup, the song choice suggests a dig not only at conservative viewpoints but at larger patriarchal standards for women. Itâ€™s also not the first time users of the video-sharing app have utilized makeup as a tool for political discussion. In 2019, a makeup video went viral after containing a call to action of Chinaâ€™s treatment of Uighurs. More recently, a makeup video filmed to the soundtrack of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s response to offensive comments made by Representative Ted Yoho also went viral. In response to the â€œRepublican-sonaâ€� trend, some rightwing TikTok users created an alternative â€œliberal-sonaâ€� trend, which usually involves looking like an e-girl, having colorful hair and contouring the tip of your nose.
With many of the makeovers done by people not old enough to vote yet, the comment sections can get heated. â€œYâ€™all wanna take our rights away but are crying over a TikTok trend,â€� wrote one user, directed at conservatives on the app. â€œI havenâ€™t seen one Republican do good makeup,â€� wrote another. Considering the app has a large issue with transphobia and harassment, the trend is by no means bullying. It is, however, diluting the actual political message, says one user. In a video explaining why she isnâ€™t interacting with the trend, she said: â€œI think the problem that I have is that it feels a lot more like taking the mick out of these girls for what they look like as opposed to their political views.â€� This, says the user, is â€œrebranding internalized misogyny as activismâ€� and becomes more problematic when white creators create a stereotype of bigotry in order to distance themselves from it. Ioana Literat, assistant professor of communication, media and learning technologies at Columbia University, studies how TikTok is shaping the political conversation. Literat began her research on the app with the hope that pop culture could bring people with opposing viewpoints together, but says her findings are less encouraging. â€œEven though thereâ€™s a lot of potential, in practice itâ€™s still very polarized,â€� she says. â€œAlthough this trend is tongue-in-cheek and sarcastic, which is in line with the spirit of the platform, it does show just how divided our society is and also how obvious these divisions are in the eyes of Gen Z. This polarization is seemingly insurmountable.â€� Literat says that social media are becoming more explicitly political across platforms but this isnâ€™t translating to more engaged or nuanced conversations across political lines. However, the opportunity for young people to talk about politics, find community or express themselves politically in creative ways, she says is encouraging. â€œPolitics used to be off the table but, for Gen Z, activism is part of who they are and so weâ€™re seeing their political stances unapologetically front and center.â€� Turns out the next time youâ€™re using blush or choosing your shade of foundation, youâ€™re also partaking in the concerning political divide."
2021-03-01T17:55:21Z,technology,Technology,Biden gives tentative support to Amazon workers in union push,"Joe Biden has offered tentative support to Amazon warehouse workers in the middle of a closely fought vote to unionize. If successful, the union would be the first for US warehouse workers of the online shopping behemoth. While Biden did not reference Amazon by name, in a video message released late Sunday he sent his support to “workers in Alabama”, where 5,800 employees at an Amazon fulfillment center in Bessemer have until 29 March to vote on whether to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). “Unions put power in the hands of workers. They level the playing field. They give you a stronger voice, for your health, your safety, higher wages, protections from racial discrimination and sexual harassment,” Biden said. He added there “should be no intimidation, no coercion, no threats, no anti-union propaganda” from employers.
Employees at warehouses across the country have reported working long hours and being expected to meet intense quotas. In recent years, the company has responded to criticism of its labor practices by offering a minimum wage of $15 and benefits like healthcare and retirement plans to employees. But workers still report a stressful and sometimes dangerous workplace. The union vote, which kicked off on 8 February and is taking place by mail, is the first major union vote for Amazon warehouse workers in the US, and comes after the company has waged a vigorous campaign to discourage workers from organizing. Workers have reported receiving anti-union texts, being forced to attend “information” meetings where managers disparage unions and anti-union posters in employee restrooms. Amazon has told workers that unionizing means “giving up the right to speak for yourself” and that unions would be taking their money “for nothing”. That union supporters managed to successfully get about a third of the Bessemer warehouse workers to sign cards calling for the election to take place – and that the vote is taking place by mail even though Amazon pushed to have it held in-person – has teed up the vote as one of the most important labor fights in recent US history. Warehouse workers across the country have tried to unionize for years, but this vote is the closest any warehouse has come to unionizing. Labor experts say that if the Bessemer warehouse workers successfully unionize, it could encourage unions at other fulfilment centers, of which Amazon has 110 in the US, especially in more pro-union states like California and New York. In a statement, Stuart Appelbaum, the president of RWDSU, thanked Biden “for sending a clear message of support” to the workers. “As President Biden points out, the best way for working people to protect themselves and their families is by organizing into unions. And that is why so many working women and men are fighting for a union at the Amazon facility in Bessemer,” reads the statement. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
2021-03-01T13:01:30Z,technology,Technology,Deep Nostalgia: 'creepy' new service uses AI to animate old family photos,"Deep Nostalgia, a new service from the genealogy site MyHeritage that animates old family photos, has gone viral on social media, in another example of how AI-based image manipulation is becoming increasingly mainstream. Launched in late February, the service uses an AI technique called deep learning to automatically animate faces in photos uploaded to the system. Because of its ease of use, and free trial, it soon took off on Twitter, where users uploading animated versions of old family photos, celebrity pictures, and even drawings and illustrations.
Like most â€œdeepfakesâ€� â€“ the name for the popular use of this technology to map one personâ€™s face on to footage of another â€“ the service is exceptionally good at smoothly animating features and expressions. But it can also struggle to generate data to fill in the â€œgapsâ€� in what it can see from the source photos, causing a sense of the uncanny.
â€œSome people love the Deep Nostalgia feature and consider it magical, while others find it creepy and dislike it,â€� MyHeritage says about its technology. â€œIndeed, the results can be controversial and itâ€™s hard to stay indifferent to this technology. This feature is intended for nostalgic use, that is, to bring beloved ancestors back to life. Our driver videos donâ€™t include speech in order to prevent abuse of this, such as the creation of â€˜deep fakeâ€™ videos of living people.â€� Not every video created with the service is elegantly animated, or even good enough to be unsettling, of course. An animated version of the infamous bust of Ronaldo, for instance, is exactly as distressing as the static version:
Three years ago, artificially producing a 15-second face-swap of Theresa May and Margaret Thatcher took the Guardian several hours on a powerful desktop computer. Now, the same effect can be done for free with a mobile phone and apps such as Snapchat, or be given away for free as a promotion for a genealogy website. And while the automatically produced videos of Deep Nostalgia are not likely to fool anyone into thinking they are real footage, more careful application of the same technology can be very hard to distinguish from reality. Tom Cruise seems to be a particular subject of choice: in 2019, a video clip went viral of the comedian Bill Hader being morphed into the Hollywood star as he performed an impression on David Lettermanâ€™s show. Last month, a new TikTok account named deeptomcruise racked up millions of views with a series of videos that are, it claims, deepfake versions of the actor talking to camera. The Cruise fakes are so accurate that many programmes designed to recognise manipulated media are unable to spot them."
2021-03-01T10:00:20Z,technology,Technology,Optimizing for outrage: ex-Obama digital chief urges curbs on big tech,"A former digital strategist for Barack Obama has demanded an end to big tech’s profit-driven optimization of outrage and called for regulators to curb online disinformation and division. Michael Slaby – author of a new book, For All the People: Redeeming the Broken Promises of Modern Media and Reclaiming Our Civic Life – described tech giants Facebook and Google as “two gorillas” crushing the very creativity needed to combat conspiracy theories spread by former US president Donald Trump and others. “The systems are not broken,” Slaby, 43, told the Guardian by phone from his home in Rhinebeck, New York. “They are working exactly as they were designed for the benefit of their designers. They can be designed differently. We can express and encourage a different set of public values about the public goods that we need from our public sphere.” Facebook has almost 2.8 billion global monthly active users with a total of 3.3 billion using any of the company’s core products – Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger – on a monthly basis. Its revenue in the fourth quarter of last year was $28bn, up 33% from a year earlier, and profits climbed 53% to $11.2bn.
But the social network founded by Mark Zuckerberg stands accused of poisoning the information well. Critics say it polarises users and allows hate speech and conspiracy theories to thrive, and that people who join extremist groups are often directed by the platform’s algorithm. The use of Facebook by Trump supporters involved in the 6 January insurrection at the US Capitol has drawn much scrutiny. Slaby believes Facebook and Twitter were too slow to remove Trump from their platforms. “This is where I think they hide behind arguments like the first amendment,” he said. “The first amendment is about government suppression of speech; it doesn’t have anything to do with your access to Facebook.
“They don’t want to constrain free expression for economic reasons and so there’s a very cynical view: yeah, sure, they kicked President Trump off right before President Biden’s inauguration after they’d made all the money they possibly could on it and he was going to be less influential. “He had been lying and promoting misinformation for a long time before that, knowingly. Could they have made that choice earlier? Yes. Was that choice very hard because he was an elected leader of the most powerful democracy in the world? Yes, that’s a really hard choice, like a crazy Faustian bargain.
“But this is a place where the fact that they were alone as private entities, having to think about how to make this choice with no public moral leadership or regulatory framework to help them, is actually a big problem. This is a purely private decision over a very public sphere. That’s a problem – but something we can fix.” Slaby calls for a combination of moral leadership, public advocacy, engagement by politicians, new regulatory frameworks and collective action by users to rein in a few private companies that currently wield massive influence over the public sphere. Slaby was the Obama election campaign’s chief technology officer in 2008 and chief integration and innovation officer in 2012. Their revolutionary approach to online organizing helped secure two presidential election victories. It was an optimistic era when Democrats enjoyed a warm relationship with Facebook and Google and social media seemed to promise community, democratization and a diversity of voices. Slaby, whose book examines how the tech revolution instead undermined civic life, commented: “My experience of leaders inside Facebook is that many of them are smart, well-intentioned people that recognize the systems aren’t perfect and they need to change. They are inside an economic system that is not incentivized for them to get healthier and that’s tricky. They’re not a B-Corp [a firm certified for its social and environmental performance]. They are a for-profit company with shareholders that demand they are optimized for profit.
“It is not always easy for even the best actors inside Facebook to make good choices. Now, that said, they make a lot of choices that look good publicly but don’t really move the needle in terms of the basic mechanisms of attention and outrage inside the system. What is really needed are some fundamental redesigns about how we engage with each other and what these systems are optimized for if we’re really going to reclaim a healthy civic discourse.” Facebook’s defenders are sure to object to heavy-handed government intervention. But regulation now seems unavoidable.
Slaby contends: “We can’t do nothing. What we are doing is not working for us. There is a valid concern around government censorship becoming the dictator of what is valid – the tyranny of the majority – but that has also been used as a justification for perpetuating racism in America since the first fucking day of this country. So we also have to be attuned to what are we protecting. “The answer ultimately is about transparency, visibility into how we are making choices, the ability to unmake choices, especially like algorithmic decisions, and having a meaningful public dialogue that helps to express a values-based moral framework for considering how we want civic discourse to function. It is about a public declaration that is then enforced and codified in regulation – but isn’t just about President Biden telling me what to believe because I don’t want that either.” Earlier this month Senator Amy Klobuchar unveiled legislation to update antitrust laws, empower regulatory bodies and allow greater competition to big tech. The need to confront and check the power of companies such as Facebook and Google is a rare area of bipartisan agreement. Slaby believes that it is essential. “It’s not just about power and control, it’s also about innovation,” he said. “We live in a world where creativity and innovation is dramatically lessened because of the weight and power of these two gorillas.”
Conspiracy theories are not new but they have been supercharged by social media with the antisemitic QAnon movement, identified by the FBI as potential domestic terror threat, among the most notorious examples. QAnon’s acolytes were visible at Trump campaign rallies and the US Capitol riot. But Slaby warns against any sweeping demonization. “I don’t think we can paint like the entire movement and anybody who’s ever been ‘QAnon curious’ with the same brush. Those people are looking for something and we need to be honest about what is it they’re looking for. “And by the way, what are they not getting from other leadership or other political institutions or other cultural or civic or social institutions that they’re getting there? How are we failing to provide people with a sense of belonging and safety that leaves them searching and susceptible to being exploited and misled?”
One of Biden’s biggest challenges is how to bridge the divide and reach the millions who bought into Trump’s election lies or QAnon or other conspiracy theories. Slaby, now chief strategist of the not-for-profit Harmony Labs, suggested: “It starts by not calling them all stupid. You can’t start with, ‘You’re crazy and stupid,’ and then say. ‘But we want to be friends.’ That’s just not going to work. “I agree with the reality that you hear on the left of, ‘We don’t want to unify with white supremacy’. That’s why I say we need to call out genuine extremism, but call in the people who are getting caught up in something that they didn’t understand or didn’t mean to be part of. “That distinction is tough but ultimately for the Biden administration and the left more broadly that’s about not getting into an argument about QAnon but articulating a vision for the future that gives people this sense of belonging and safety and solves this problem of futurelessness, that gives people a reason to be part of something else.”"
2021-03-01T07:00:18Z,technology,Technology,Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold review: a glimpse at the future of folding PCs,"Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Fold is an entirely new form – a tablet PC that closes like a book with a foldable screen. It may just be the future of the computer. The £2,500-plus X1 Fold joins a rarefied group of cutting edge folding-screen devices that include the reinvention of the flip phone and a mobile tablet that folds in half to fit in your pocket. Other than hefty price tags, they all have one thing in common: big screens that fold into more compact shapes. The leather-bound X1 Fold is about the size of a large paperback book when closed, but opens fully to reveal a gorgeous 13.3in OLED screen about the same as a laptop.
The way it opens and closes is pure sci-fi. But fully unfolded it is remarkable how mundane the X1 Fold appears to be: it looks and works like any other flat Windows tablet such as Microsoft’s Surface Pro with a kickstand out the back to prop it up. Just getting to that level of normality for something quite so exotic as this is an impressive achievement. You can’t see a crease down the middle at all with the screen on, and only if you position a bright light at just the right angle can you see it with the screen off. You have to push pretty hard on the centre with your finger to feel it too. It’s much less obvious than other folding-screen devices. The screen is crisp, good-looking and great for indoor working, but it isn’t quite bright enough to see in direct sunlight.
Tablet mode works great at a desk with an ample screen for getting work done. But when you want to move to kitchen table or the sofa, just fold the screen into a laptop configuration and the hinge will hold it there. The top half acts as the screen and the bottom can either display a second screen, such as Zoom up top with notes on the bottom, or a virtual keyboard. You can also use Lenovo’s optional mini Bluetooth keyboard, which snaps into place via magnets covering half the screen. With the keyboard in place the X1 Fold behaves like a very small but surprisingly capable laptop. The top screen may only be 9.5in on the diagonal, but its 1,536 x 1,204 resolution is not dissimilar to many mid-range laptops, which means apps and sites work as normal. The super-compact nature would make it ideal for use on a plane or train on cramped seat trays.
When work is done you can ditch the keyboard and use it like a book. A pdf or Word document or Kindle book via Amazon’s Cloud Reader set to show two pages on screen in landscape is a pretty good fit for the two halves of the screen. And of course it functions as a handheld tablet just fine for watching Netflix or Amazon Prime. Finally, you can use Lenovo’s Mod Pen for sketching or signing documents, which works just as well as other top PC styluses. There are many multi-talented devices available, but none of them operate quite like the X1 Fold. The outside sliding leather cover, the sturdy magnesium body and great screen make the Lenovo feel like it is worth its hefty sum. Specifications Screen: 13.3in flexible OLED 2,048 x 1,536 (192PPI) Processor: Intel Core i5-L16G7 RAM: 8GB Storage: 256, 512GB or 1TB SSD Graphics: Intel UHD Operating system: Windows 10 Home or Pro Camera: 5MP front-facing Connectivity: wifi 6 (ax), Bluetooth 5.1, optional 5G, 2xUSB-C (Gen 2), Dimensions unfolded: 299.4 x 236.0 x 11.5mm Dimensions folded: 158.2 x 236.0 x 27.8mm Weight: 999g Solid performance and 5.5-hour battery life
The X1 Fold has Intel’s Core i5 hybrid processor, which is a lower-power chip than the regular Core i5 found in most laptops. It was first used in the Samsung Galaxy Book S, which had a slightly disappointing performance. The X1 Fold handles surprisingly well, however. It won’t win any raw performance awards, but it was generally snappy and perfectly capable of doing everything I asked of it, from fairly complex edits in Affinity Photo to wrangling 30 tabs in Chrome. It has fans but I heard them only when the machine was doing updates. The battery lasts about 5.5 hours of work in laptop or desktop mode, or closer to 6.5 hours just used for browsing as a tablet, which is a little shorter than the eight-plus hours expected of a regular Windows tablet. The compromises
As remarkably well as the X1 Fold works, there are some compromises that have had to be made to get it to market, beyond the very high price. The tablet was intended to run Microsoft’s new Windows 10X software, which is designed for folding and dual-screen devices but is delayed by a year or so and therefore not available yet. Instead Lenovo had to ship the X1 Fold with regular Windows 10 and a small utility to help split the screen in two when it folds, which works well enough but couldn’t be described as a smooth and polished experience. Transitioning between tablet and laptop modes makes the screen flash and everything takes a moment to resize. There are two USB-C ports, but one of them is on the bottom edge and therefore blocked when stood up with the kickstand. There is no headphone socket, either. The machine has an infrared camera for biometric login with Windows Hello, but it isn’t supported yet with an update promised for Windows this year rendering it redundant until that point.
The deal-breaker for me is the keyboard. The mini keyboard is a marvel and infuriating in equal measure. It wirelessly charges when attached to the X1 Fold and fits the screen perfectly with good-feeling, almost regular-sized keys. But to make it fit Lenovo had to cut out two rows of keys from the right side of the standard UK keyboard, including the square brackets, question mark and apostrophe keys, placing those symbols behind combinations of modifiers such as Fn+Shift+L for the @ symbol. Most of altered keys I can live with, except for apostrophe, which is Fn+L on this keyboard. I didn’t realise how much I use the apostrophe until I started hitting return by accident when trying to write “I’m” or “it’s” in chats. Even after two weeks I still couldn’t get used to it. The design of the US version of the mini keyboard looks better, as it has fewer of the main punctuation marks hidden behind modifier keys. Note, too, that the durability of foldable screens is still a worry compared with flat, glass-covered versions, despite other types having survived daily life well. Sustainability
The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold is generally repairable by authorised service centres and the battery is replaceable. The battery has a life expectancy of at least 1,000 full charge cycles while maintaining at least 70% of its original capacity. The screen is rated for thousands of folds. Lenovo does not operate trade-in or recycling schemes in the UK, but does publish environmental impact and carbon footprint assessments for its products. The X1 Fold contains 5.5% post-consumer recycled plastic. Observations
The X1 Fold has undergone the same MIL-STD-810H durability testing as other Lenovo machines. The bezels around the screen are soft-touch rubber, which are magnets for dust. The speakers are loud but a bit tinny compared with the best in a tablet. The screen doesn’t feel any different but you have to be a little bit more careful to not press too hard with a (optional) stylus as it is not quite as tough as a regular glass display. Price The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold starts at an RRP of £2,551.43 with 256GB of storage or £3,089.99 with the keyboard and pen. The model with 512GB of storage costs £3,209.99 or £3,239.99 with 5G also. The Mod Pen costs £90 and the Mini Keyboard costs £200 separately. For comparison, a Microsoft Surface Pro 7 starts at £799 while Lenovo’s X1 Tablet costs £1,679.99. Verdict The Lenovo X1 Fold is an amazing piece of technology that works far better than a proof of concept should. It’s not perfect in any way, but it is remarkable just how well it works given that the software it was designed for – Windows 10X – isn’t available yet. It is far too expensive and there are a few too many compromises for me to actually recommend anyone buy one, but it stands as proof that folding screens can be useful at any size and the ultra-compact PCs of the near future are going to be fantastic. But if you’re the kind of well-heeled person who wears couture clothing to meetings and wants to be the envy of everyone pulling out a PC screen that folds in half, the Lenovo X1 Fold is for you. There’s nothing else quite like it. Pros: fantastic folding screen, attractive book-like design, USB-C, reasonable performance, multiple modes, smart keyboard design, compatible with stylus. Cons: expensive, software experience needs work, battery life a little short, durability of folding screen unproven, no headphone socket, awkward second USB-C port position, no Thunderbolt 3/4 support, IR camera not yet supported by Windows Hello.

2021-03-01T00:01:08Z,technology,Technology,Uber accused of using 'loaded questions' in survey of drivers,"Uber has been accused of using “loaded questions” in a consultation with drivers, after a landmark court ruling handed workers rights to improved conditions. The firm may have to pay out over £100m in compensation to 10,000 drivers, after the UK supreme court ruled last week they are entitled to holiday pay, a company pension and the national minimum wage. Uber has previously argued that its 60,000 UK drivers are self-employed independent contractors with limited employment rights. A questionnaire, sent out via the Uber drivers’ app following the ruling, offers a limited choice of answers on questions about benefits and flexible working without mentioning holiday pay or the national minimum wage – both of which the court found Uber drivers were entitled to. Steve Garelick, a regional organiser for the GMB union, said: “These are loaded questions to get the answer they need.”
He said the way the questions were posed suggested that Uber could be hoping to lobby government for a change in the rules to suit their existing working practices rather than changing their practices to fit the rules. James Farrar, one of the lead claimants in the supreme court case and general secretary of the App Drivers & Couriers Union, said: “The driver survey is a crude attempt by Uber to divert attention away from their obligation to abide by the supreme court ruling and immediately implement the statutory protections of worker status for all their drivers. “Instead, Uber is setting up the cruelly manipulative false choice between fairness and flexibility by loading the survey with bias and leading questions. “Uber should focus on how it can best quickly implement the ruling rather than set up an alternative set of improvements based on a set of assumptions derived from a biased survey.” One questions asks, for example: “When deciding to whether to earn on the Uber app which best describes you? It offers only three possible answers: “I value the ability to work flexibly and determine when and where I drive”, “I would value being able to access new benefits and protections such as pension contributions, knowing that this could mean I lose control of when and where I drive” or “neither/don’t know”. Nigel Mackay, a partner at law firm Leigh Day, is representing more than 1,000 drivers seeking compensation for missed holiday pay in the wake of the supreme court ruling.
He said that the question on flexibility was presented “as there being a binary choice between flexibility or benefits (again, without even mentioning some of the most important benefits), whereas in reality it is not a choice between the two. They could maintain flexibility for drivers and provide the benefits.” An Uber spokesperson said: “We are currently studying the details of the judgment and listening to all active drivers to help us shape the future of flexible work. We will share the conclusions of this process in the coming weeks.” A source close to the company said it would respect the supreme court verdict and had discussed issues such as holiday pay at roundtable discussions with small groups of drivers this week. But Mick Rix, national officer of the GMB, said: “They’re leading drivers up the garden path. “Worker status does not mean drivers losing flexibility, it means they will get the legal rights the courts have ruled they are entitled to.” Mackay said individuals’ opinions on benefits were irrelevant as the rules were enshrined in law and the research appeared to be set out for PR purposes. “For example, where they ask drivers what they would like to see more of, they don’t refer to paid holiday/minimum wage. It seems that this is so that, down the line, they can say that drivers are not interested in holiday pay or the minimum wage because they carried out research and the most popular benefits were other things,” Mackay said."
2021-02-27T14:12:02Z,technology,Technology,How to avoid 'Zoom fatigue' during the Covid pandemic,"Imagine you are walking around your workplace followed incessantly by colleagues holding a mirror that causes you to stare at yourself for large parts of the day. The bizarre scenario is in effect becoming the norm in the era of physically distanced video conference meetings and this “nonverbal overload” is leading to “Zoom fatigue”, according to a study by Jeremy Bailenson, professor of communication at Stanford University. The new peer-reviewed research, published in the journal Technology, Mind and Behaviour, listed the consequences of likely unprecedentedly excessive amounts of close-up eye contact with others and reflections of oneself during prolonged video chats.
“Decades of psychology research shows that when you’re looking at yourself we scrutinise ourselves, we evaluate ourselves, and this over time causes stress and negative emotions,” Bailenson told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “When we’re forced to look at ourselves in a realtime video or mirror, we do behave as an idealised version of ourselves, in other words we try to be the best person we can be. But that comes at a cost.” When another person’s face is extremely physically close to ours, our brains are led to believe mating or conflict is close on the horizon, according to Bailenson. “What’s happening, in effect, when you’re using Zoom for many, many hours is you’re in this hyper-aroused state.” But there are easy ways to avoid the intensity and minimise the inevitable lethargy, he says. These include reducing the size of the video chat window and not using full screen, and using an external keyboard to create greater distance between oneself and the grid of prying faces. Crucially, Zoom users can also diverge from the default settings and use the hide self-view button, or even periodically turn their camera off altogether if feasible, “to give oneself a brief nonverbal rest”, Bailenson writes. “This is not simply you turning off your camera to take a break from having to be nonverbally active, but also turning your body away from the screen, so that for a few minutes you are not smothered with gestures that are perceptually realistic but socially meaningless,” he says. In person, people can derive social cues, hints and suggestions much more easily than over video, but with mass homeworking because of Covid the frequency of video conference meetings steeply increased and Zoom became the most popular software for this purpose because it was free, effective and easy to use. Though the platform has become increasingly ubiquitous, as its stock value almost quadrupled, there has been little appreciation of the downsides, Bailenson suggests, as companies have sought to keep business ticking over amid vast disruption. The video conference epoch, in which many people remain more sedentary than if they were in the office, may also be leading to more permanent consequences. Virtual consultations for cosmetic procedures have risen 64% in the US since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. “We have absolutely seen an increase in the number of surgical cosmetic procedures that people have been seeking directly related to Zoom,” said Dr Michael Somenek, who has seen a 50% to 60% increase at his Washington surgery. “The number-one procedure that people have been coming in for is either their upper eyelids or their neck. Because they see [their neck] either hanging on the camera or looking like a double chin.”"
2021-02-27T11:00:23Z,technology,Technology,What Facebook's Australia news ban could mean for its future in the US,"Facebook’s dramatic decision last week to block news from being shared to its users in Australia is already seeing global legislative aftershocks and may present new challenges for the company in the US. Facebook in mid-February banned Australian news organizations from posting content on the platform and barred users based in Australia from linking to news articles from Australian and international outlets. The move came in response to proposed legislation in the country that would require platforms to pay publishers if news content was posted on their sites. Facebook has since struck a deal with the Australian government for more flexibility. But the tech giant’s show of force has added fuel to the growing demands to rein in its vast influence in the US, and has left clues as to what legislation similar to the Australian proposal could look like in the United States. “With a desire among politicians on both sides of the aisle to think more seriously about regulating social media companies, it is clear that changes are in the cards for Facebook,” said Josh Pasek, an associate professor of communications and political science at the University of Michigan. Facebook already faced unprecedented scrutiny in 2020. Company representatives, including Mark Zuckerberg, were called to testify in front of Congress several times over antitrust concerns, including over its acquisition of Instagram, its dominance in the social media space, and its influence in advertising. Investigations examining the impact of Facebook and Google’s advertising dominance continue at state and federal levels.
When it comes to legislation addressing the unchecked power of big tech, the question is not if but when it will come, said Bruce Wolpe, a fellow at the University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre. Facebook’s forceful approach in Australia would only raise the pressure for action, he said. “Thanks to its extreme heavy-handedness in Australia, all eyes are now on Facebook,” Wolpe said. “It really made an extreme tactical mistake in shutting down something of such fundamental importance to the public interest.” The incident has already made its way to the US Congress. In antitrust discussions on Thursday, it was cited by Representative David Cicilline as a reflection of Facebook’s outsized power over publishers, underscoring heightened interest in the issue and potential legislation on the horizon. New legislation on news publisher rights on Facebook would probably mirror a bill previously introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, according to the news site Axios. The measure, co-sponsored by the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, would allow newspapers to collectively bargain with dominant online platforms. Facebook may have thought it could afford a policy gamble in Australia, a country that represents one of the company’s smaller markets, Wolpe said. But the company has 223m users in the US, and the country is home to much of its workforce, making it unlikely the company would attempt similarly drastic tactics against US legislators. With this in mind, Pasek said Facebook would probably enact its own policies on payment for content in an attempt to stave off legislative action. The company has been paying some publishers millions of dollars for content since 2019 and expanded the partnership program to the UK in January of 2021. As this policy expands, so will debates about which firms should be paid for content. The code in Australia that sparked the decision to remove news declares that publishers making $150,000 per year or more can sign up to be paid for content. This would encompass many small newspapers and online publishers but stands to most benefit large companies like Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. In the US, the media market is much more varied and complex. “It is likely Facebook will try to get ahead of this kind of legislation so it is not caught off guard,” Pasek said. “This is going to get messier as time goes on.”"
2021-02-27T08:00:22Z,technology,Technology,Electricity needed to mine bitcoin is more than used by 'entire countries',"It’s not just the value of bitcoin that has soared in the last year – so has the huge amount of energy it consumes. The cryptocurrency’s value has dipped recently after passing a high of $50,000 but the energy used to create it has continued to soar during its epic rise, climbing to the equivalent to the annual carbon footprint of Argentina, according to Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, a tool from researchers at Cambridge University that measures the currency’s energy use. Recent interest from major Wall Street institutions like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs probably culminated in the currency’s rise in value and an endorsement by Tesla’s Elon Musk helped drive its recent high as investors bet the cryptocurrency will become more widely embraced in the near future.
While the recent fall has dented Musk’s fortune, bitcoin also poses a threat to the company’s mission toward a “zero-emission future” and poses serious questions for governments and corporations looking to curb their own carbon footprints. Bitcoin mining – the process in which a bitcoin is awarded to a computer that solves a complex series of algorithms – is a deeply energy-intensive process. “Mining” bitcoin involves solving complex math problems in order to create new bitcoins. Miners are rewarded in bitcoin. Earlier in bitcoin’s relatively short history – the currency was created in 2009 – one could mine bitcoin on an average computer. But the way bitcoin mining has been set up by its creator (or creators – no one really knows for sure who created it) is that there is a finite number of bitcoins that can be mined: 21m. The more bitcoin that is mined, the harder the algorithms that must be solved to get a bitcoin become. Now that over 18.5m bitcoin have been mined, the average computer can no longer mine bitcoins. Instead, mining now requires special computer equipment that can handle the intense processing power needed to get bitcoin today. And, of course, these special computers need a lot of electricity to run. The amount of electricity used to mine bitcoin “has historically been more than [electricity used by] entire countries, like Ireland”, said Benjamin Jones, a professor of economics at the University of New Mexico who has researched bitcoin’s environmental impact. “We’re talking about multiple terawatts, dozens of terawatts a year of electricity being used just for bitcoin … That’s a lot of electricity.” Proponents of bitcoin say that mining is increasingly being done with electricity from renewable sources as that type of energy becomes cheaper, and the energy used is far lower than that of other, more wasteful, uses of power. The energy wasted by plugged-in but inactive home devices in the US alone could power bitcoin mining for 1.8 years, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. But environmentalists say that mining is still a cause for concern particularly because miners will go wherever electricity is cheapest and that may mean places that use coal. According to Cambridge, China has the most bitcoin mining of any country by far. While the country has been slowly moving toward renewable energy, about two-thirds of its electricity comes from coal. Since there is no government body or organization that officially tracks where bitcoin is being mined and what type of electricity miners are using, there is no way of knowing whether miners are using electricity that is fueled by renewable energy or fossil fuels. Mining rigs can move from place to place depending on where energy is cheapest, which makes mining particularly hard to track. “The places where you mine [bitcoin] can be moved around and, in some cases, you don’t even know where they are,” said Camilo Mora, a professor of geography and environment at the University of Hawaii. Cambridge’s Centre for Alternative Finances estimates that bitcoin’s annualised electricity consumption hovers just above 115 terawatt-hours (TWh) while Digiconomist’s closely tracked index puts it closer to 80 TWh. A single transaction of bitcoin has the same carbon footprint as 680,000 Visa transactions or 51,210 hours of watching YouTube, according to the site. A paper from 2018 from the Oak Ridge Institute in Ohio found that one dollar’s worth of bitcoin took 17 megajoules of energy, more than double the amount of energy it took to mine one dollar’s worth of copper, gold and platinum. Another study from the UK published last year said that computer power required to mine Bitcoin quadrupled in 2019 compared with the year before, and that mining has had an influence in prices in some power and utility markets. Bitcoin’s advocates have made it clear that they believe any environmental costs that come with mining bitcoin are worth the broader impacts it could have on society.
“Bitcoin would not be able to fulfill its role as a secure, global value transfer and storage system without being costly to maintain,” reads a defense against bitcoin criticism from Ria Bhutoria, director of research at Fidelity Digital Assets. “Computers and smartphones have much larger carbon footprints than typewriters and telegraphs. Sometimes a technology is so revolutionary and important for humanity that society accepts the tradeoffs,” wrote investor Tyler Winklevoss on Twitter. Some have pointed out that there does not have to be a tradeoff between cryptocurrency and the environment. The creators of ethereum, considered the second most popular type of cryptocurrency after bitcoin, have promised to change the currency’s algorithm to make its mining more environmentally friendly. Vitalik Buterin, the computer scientist who invited ethereum, told IEEE Spectrum that mining cryptocurrency can be “a huge waste of resources, even if you don’t believe that pollution and carbon dioxide are an issue”, Buterin said. “There are real consumers – real people – whose need for electricity is being displaced by this stuff.” Currently, ethereum’s mining works similarly to bitcoin where the most powerful computers have an edge in getting the most bitcoin as computers compete to complete a transaction first. Ethereum’s developers are working on changing that system so that miners enter a pool and are randomly selected to complete the transaction and receive an ether in return. This method, called “proof-of-stake”, guarantees that less electricity will be used to mine the currency. But with bitcoin still reigning as the top cryptocurrency and, with endorsements from established companies and investment banks, the currency’s environmental impact is only likely to grow. When it comes to electricity, “the computer doesn’t care. The computer is just getting the electricity to run, but where its electricity comes from makes a huge difference [for the environment],” said Mora."
2021-02-26T18:53:38Z,technology,Technology,UK culture secretary warns Facebook after news ban in Australia,"The UK culture secretary has said Facebook’s recent decision to ban Australian users from accessing news on its platform was concerning, and said the firm was “putting its bottom line above the public interest”. Oliver Dowden suggested he was minded to pursue tougher regulation after a meeting on Thursday night with Nick Clegg, the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister who is now Facebook’s vice-president for communications. “We must avoid such nuclear options being taken again,” Dowden said in a strongly worded statement on Friday. “Tech titans have become the gatekeepers of online knowledge and the custodians of virtual public squares, and the government won’t shy away from intervening to protect the interests of the public when it needs to.” He said Facebook’s move strengthened his view that “we do not have properly functioning digital markets”, and he added: “The UK will be at the forefront of global efforts to address this.” The government was pressing to level the playing field to “enable proper commercial relationships to be formed”, he said, adding that closer work with other countries to secure international agreement would get under way at the next G7 summit in Cornwall in June. Dowden’s comments marked a significant intervention by the government, days after Clegg admitted that Facebook had “erred on the side of over-enforcement” by instituting a short-lived ban on content designated as news in Australia. He said “some content was blocked inadvertently”, after information from government, health and emergency services pages was blocked.
But Clegg insisted Facebook had been “forced into this position” after the Australian government refused to back down over plans to require it to negotiate with news publishers for payment for content. Tensions had been escalating for some time over legislation to force tech giants to negotiate a fair payment with news publishers for using their content. A Facebook spokesperson described the call between Dowden and Clegg as “constructive”, claiming the Australian government’s original proposals were “unworkable and ignored the value publishers get from posting their content on Facebook”. The spokesperson added Clegg agreed with Dowden’s preference for “companies to enter freely into proper commercial relationships with each other” and that in the UK, the social media firm is “paying tens of millions of pounds to national and local outlets to be part of our dedicated tab for news”. The Australian government said an 11th-hour deal was reached between Facebook and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and the platform agreed to restore news to around 18 million users days before the bill passed through parliament. It led to questions about whether stronger regulation was needed in the UK, with the head of the News Media Association, Henry Faure Walker, saying Facebook had acted like a “schoolyard bully”. Faure Walker said last week: “We need jurisdictions across the globe, including the UK, to coordinate to deliver robust regulation to create a truly level playing between the tech giants and news publishers.”"
2021-02-26T07:00:09Z,technology,Technology,"Art, amulets and cryptokitties: the new frontier of cryptocurrencies","Pudding Daintytot is a pink cat, with hearts sprinkled over its chest, a rainbow cresting behind it, draconic horns, wings and a tail. “Born” in January 2019, Pudding is a “cryptokitty”: an example of what is known as a “non-fungible token”, the latest cryptocurrency craze – unique images, film clips, animations and even poems, which are bought and sold online for increasingly large sums. Each cryptokitty is registered to a bitcoin-style database, and can be traded – and bred – according to algorithmic rules set down when the CryptoKitties service was set up back in 2017 by the Canadian startup Dapper Labs. The end result is a game, or art piece, that is somewhere between a real-world game of Pokémon, an automated replacement for the authenticity department at Sotheby’s and digital trading cards. And if you want to join in, Pudding Daintytot is on sale for $1m (£710,000). As with so much in the cryptocurrency industry – the name for the field that has grown up around bitcoin and its core “blockchain” technology – the most eye-catching thing about cryptokitties and their ilk, beyond even the lurid colour schemes, are the sums attached to them. Cryptokitties were just the first enormous boom of the craze for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. The name comes from the main difference between these projects and mainstream cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or its hipper offspring Ethereum. Those currencies, just like real money, are “fungible”: that is, one bitcoin is functionally identical to another. The insight behind NFTs is that that need not be the case: each individual token could represent anything its makers want. While they could still be traded and held in the same way as bitcoin – stored on a decentralised database, without any ruling authority in charge and outside the reach of much government oversight – they could represent, not just simple cash-like balances, but ownership of artworks, songs, videos or poems. The leaders of the latest boom occupy various points on that spectrum. At the commercial end is NBA Top Shot, a spin on trading cards, officially licensed by the National Basketball Association, made by CryptoKitties developer Dapper Labs. Collectors can buy booster packs containing a random collection of short clips of basketball games in action – and they can then trade and sell those clips on a digital market. In the six months since it went live, more than $200m has been traded on the market, including a single clip of LeBron James dunking, which went for $208,000. At the other end of the spectrum are artist-focused systems such as Zora, Foundation and SuperRare, each more open-ended offerings that allow artists to create their own digital markets for their works. In 2020, the digital artist Beeple, who makes grotesque hyper-real political cartoons, sold more than $3.5m of artworks through one such system, selling multiple editions for $969 and auctioning 21 unique pieces for six-figures. The money is enticing, but the field raises questions. Chiefly, for many: why? What is the actual point? “I don’t find NFTs enticing as a platform for releasing art on,” says v buckenham, a London-based digital artist who ought to be the target market for the systems. “The point of owning a piece of art is to look at it and enjoy it – and buying an NFT doesn’t do anything to help you do that. An NFT is just an entry in a fancy database somewhere asserting that you ‘own’ the artwork. The only thing it’s good for is allowing you to sell on that database entry to someone else later on. “I have sympathy for digital artists who are releasing work as NFTs,” they add. “It’s hard to make money as a digital artist, and hard to turn down a new revenue stream. But NFTs don’t really have anything to do with the artwork themselves. If you look at an NFT entry, it’s just a hash, a string of numbers and letters, and doesn’t let you view the art itself. It takes the worst of the high-end art market – works sitting around in air-conditioned warehouses in ports, being speculated on but never actually being looked at – and makes it a thousand times less ecologically friendly.” Just like bitcoin itself, the energy cost of the NFT field is astronomical, if hard to quantify. The databases work by burning untold gigajoules of power (bitcoin’s energy usage is more than twice that of Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook combined), and the novelist and digital artist Robin Sloan estimated that by idly experimenting with the field one afternoon he created almost half a tonne of carbon emissions. But Sloan thinks the projects could be more than simply speculation. His own NFT turns the field in on itself: he creates “amulets”, short poems with mathematical properties that happen to create a pleasing coincidence in the very plumbing of the network itself, with strings of eights in their code. And Sloan, as the creator of his own protocol, can add one further requirement: “A carbon offset [1 metric tonne or more] is purchased to compensate for the CO2 produced by the poem’s life on the blockchain, with proof of that purchase included in the poem’s metadata.” So far, just six amulets have been discovered, and one of the first is pleasing in its simplicity. It reads, in full: “DON’T WORRY.” • This article was amended on 26 February 2021. An earlier version said cryptokitties were the “oldest major example” of NFTs. This has been amended. While cryptokitties were the first NFTs to enjoy a major boom there were older forms of NFT, some of which later boomed."
2021-02-25T21:23:58Z,technology,Technology,Facebook returns news to Australian feeds as company seals further deals with media outlets ,"Facebook has returned news to Australian users after an eight day blackout and standoff with the federal government. Last week, the social media giant stripped all news from its platform for more than 13 million users and inadvertently blocked information and government pages, including health and emergency services. The historic banning of news came during escalating tensions over legislation that would force the tech giants to negotiate a fair payment with news publishers for using their content. The government said an 11th-hour deal was reached between Facebook and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, and the platform agreed to restore news to Australian users just days before the bill passed through parliament.
Australian and international news content reappeared on Facebook around 1am AEDT Friday morning, and Australian news content was once again visible to international users. The changes mean the government may not apply the code to Facebook if the company can demonstrate it has signed enough deals with media outlets to pay them for content. The government has also agreed that Facebook and other platforms, which would be subject to the code, would be given a month’s notice to comply. Frydenberg told Sydney radio station 2GB this was a victory. “It’s fair to say Google and Facebook didn’t want this code to come into existence, but today it has and, as a result, Australian news media businesses will get paid for content and journalism will be sustained in this country,” he said. A deal between Facebook and Schwartz Media, the publishers of the Saturday Paper and the Monthly magazine, was announced on Friday as news returned to users’ feeds. Solstice Media, which publishes the New Daily and City Mag, and Crikey publisher Private Media, have signed similar deals with the tech giant. “These agreements will bring a new slate of premium journalism, including some previously paywalled content, to Facebook,” a spokesperson for Facebook said. Rebecca Costello, CEO of Schwartz Media, said the deal would help promote a plurality of voices in Australian media.
“We have collaborated with Facebook in the past and we look forward to the ways in which this deal will help us to continue producing Australia’s leading independent journalism,” she said. On Tuesday evening, Seven West Media, which owns the West Australian newspaper and the Seven TV network, became the first Australian media company to sign a letter of intent to provide news content to Facebook. Details and the value of the deal were not disclosed in the announcement. It’s expected that more media companies will strike deals with Facebook in the coming weeks after a slate of similar agreements were reached with Google earlier in the month. Frydenberg said Australia had been a “proxy battle” for the rest of the world on the regulation of Google and Facebook. “I have no doubt that so many other countries are looking at what is happening here in Australia, because of this innovative code the Morrison government is now pursuing, so Facebook and Google have not hidden the fact that they know that the eyes of the world are on Australia, and that is why they have sought to get a code here that is workable,” he said. Since Thursday last week, Australian news organisation Facebook pages have been wiped, with their feeds containing only a message saying there are “no posts yet”, and users that tried to post a news link receive a message saying their post could not go through. This wall has now come down and it appears that the entire posting history of news pages has been restored."
2021-02-24T22:30:09Z,technology,Technology,"AI could have profound effect on way GCHQ works, says director","GCHQ’s director has said artificial intelligence software could have a profound impact on the way it operates, from spotting otherwise missed clues to thwart terror plots to better identifying the sources of fake news and computer viruses. Jeremy Fleming’s remarks came as the spy agency prepared to publish a rare paper on Thursday defending its use of machine-learning technology to placate critics concerned about its bulk surveillance activities. “AI, like so many technologies, offers great promise for society, prosperity and security. Its impact on GCHQ is equally profound,” he said. “While this unprecedented technological evolution comes with great opportunity, it also poses significant ethical challenges for all of society, including GCHQ.” AI is considered controversial because it relies on computer algorithms to make decisions based on patterns found in data. It is used alongside human analysts in investigations. GCHQ will not formally say exactly how it uses AI software or which data it analyses, but it relies in part on monitoring people’s phone and messaging data and watching social media profiles. But the agency, which is based in Cheltenham, recognises that it needs to engage better with the public after the Snowden disclosures highlighted the scale of its mass surveillance nearly a decade ago. Key figures at GCHQ believe AI is able to point MI5 and counter-terrorism police to missed clues in identifying potentially deadly threats as part of what insiders said would amount to a “step change” in its operation. The agency also indicated that AI could, in theory, help to better identify sources of fake news or spot deep fake images, which come typically from Russia, and more quickly spot and trace malicious virus software that often emerges from China or North Korea. It could also support the National Crime Agency analyse billions of child abuse images, searching for hidden evidence of digital image manipulation and so minimising the amount of time human investigators have to spend examining shocking content. Using algorithms to investigate and monitor individuals has generated controversy in some areas of law enforcement. There are concerns, for example, that tools such as facial recognition software have exhibited a race bias when previously tested. It also emerged earlier this month that German police want to be able to create fake computer-generated images in sting operations against paedophiles. Daragh Murray, a senior lecturer at the human rights centre and school of law at the University of Essex, said the problem for intelligence agencies such as GCHQ was that it was unclear what was ruled in and ruled out. “The difficulty with ethical frameworks, and we have seen this consistently across the tech sector, is that they are notoriously imprecise. They do not establish concrete obligations,” he said. One expert who has worked closely with GCHQ said AI was better suited to “augmenting the analytic process” by analysing large datasets and passing on the results to human investigators. Alexander Babuta, a research fellow with the Royal United Services Institute, said GCHQ’s problem was making sense of the vast volumes of data that it collects. “The challenge is filtering it and triaging it to a manageable level so human analysts can make sense of it. That is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, but it could also be less intrusive because the data is being handled by machines, not people,” he said. But there are limitations to the power of the technology. GCHQ does not believe it is yet possible to predict when someone has been radicalised to the point where they might commit a terrorism offence, a technology that carries echoes of the film Minority Report, in which people are arrested “pre-crime”."
2021-02-24T13:40:09Z,technology,Technology,"Facebook over-enforced Australia news ban, admits Nick Clegg","Facebook “erred on the side of over-enforcement” in removing links to hundreds of non-media organisations in Australia, Nick Clegg has admitted, in a blogpost defending the social media company’s short-lived news ban there. The former UK deputy prime minister, now Facebook’s vice-president of global affairs and communications, said the tech firm had been “forced into [the] position” of blocking content designated as news after the Australian government refused to back down over plans to require it to negotiate with news publishers for payment for content. But in his first significant public intervention on the controversy, Clegg acknowledged that public service content including health department and emergency services sites, family violence support information, and community news hubs should not have been caught up in the ban. While some pages were quickly restored, others had been expected to take up to a week to even be reviewed, before the ban was rescinded on Tuesday. “It wasn’t a decision taken lightly,” he wrote in a post headlined The Real Story of What Happened With News on Facebook in Australia. “But when it came, we had to take action quickly because it was legally necessary to do so before the new law came into force, and so we erred on the side of over-enforcement. In doing so, some content was blocked inadvertently. Much of this was, thankfully, reversed quickly.” Facebook reversed the ban on Tuesday after the government agreed to make minor changes to its news media code, allowing the company more time to negotiate payments and giving it a possible exemption from the law if it made a big enough contribution to the Australian media voluntarily. While critics have viewed Facebook’s action as an anti-democratic step designed to warn other jurisdictions off similar actions designed to protect journalism, others have argued that the Australian proposals were unworkable and overly influenced by News Corp, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch. While Clegg did not refer to News Corp by name, he wrote: “It is ironic that some of the biggest publishers that have long advocated for free markets and voluntary commercial undertakings now appear to be in favour of state-sponsored price setting.” He added: “Of course, the internet has been disruptive for the news industry. But he argued that under the proposals, “Facebook would have been forced to pay potentially unlimited amounts of money to multinational media conglomerates … without even so much as a guarantee that it is used to pay for journalism.” Clegg’s stance presents an awkward association for members of his old party in the UK, the Liberal Democrats, who came out strongly against the plans and sought to distance themselves from their former leader. Jamie Stone, the party’s culture and media spokesperson, said: “What is in effect a move to muzzle the voice of a democratically elected government [by an] international corporation is entirely wrong. “It is ultimately up to Nick Clegg to be accountable to what he does and believes.” Clegg acknowledged in his post that “there are legitimate concerns to be addressed about the size and power of tech companies, just as there are serious issues about the disruption the internet has caused to the news industry.” But he claimed there was no truth to the idea that Facebook was stealing or taking original journalism for its own benefit and claimed that “many users say they would like to see even less news and political content”. He said making Facebook pay for news content was “like forcing carmakers to fund radio stations because people might listen to them in the car – and letting the stations set the price.” He also drew attention to what he claimed was evidence of its recognition that “quality journalism is at the heart of how open societies function” in its deals to pay for content with media outlets including the Guardian, the Financial Times and the Daily Mail in the UK as well as local publishers."
2021-02-24T00:39:33Z,technology,Technology,"SolarWinds hack was work of 'at least 1,000 engineers', tech executives tell Senate","Tech executives revealed that a historic cybersecurity breach that affected about 100 US companies and nine federal agencies was larger and more sophisticated than previously known. The revelations came during a hearing of the US Senate’s select committee on intelligence on Tuesday on last year’s hack of SolarWinds, a Texas-based software company. Using SolarWinds and Microsoft programs, hackers believed to be working for Russia were able to infiltrate the companies and government agencies. Servers run by Amazon were also used in the cyber-attack, but that company declined to send representatives to the hearing. Representatives from the impacted firms, including SolarWinds, Microsoft, and the cybersecurity firms FireEye Inc and CrowdStrike Holdings, told senators that the true scope of the intrusions is still unknown, because most victims are not legally required to disclose attacks unless they involve sensitive information about individuals. But they described an operation of stunning size.
Brad Smith, the Microsoft president, said its researchers believed “at least 1,000 very skilled, very capable engineers” worked on the SolarWinds hack. “This is the largest and most sophisticated sort of operation that we have seen,” Smith told senators. Smith said the hacking operation’s success was due to its ability to penetrate systems through routine processes. SolarWinds functions as a network monitoring software, working deep in the infrastructure of information technology systems to identify and patch problems, and provides an essential service for companies around the world. “The world relies on the patching and updating of software for everything,” Smith said. “To disrupt or tamper with that kind of software is to in effect tamper with the digital equivalent of our public health service. It puts the entire world at greater risk.” “It’s a little bit like a burglar who wants to break into a single apartment but manages to turn off the alarm system for every home and every building in the entire city,” he added. “Everybody’s safety is put at risk. That is what we’re grappling with here.” Smith said many techniques used by the hackers have not come to light and that the attacker might have used up to a dozen different means of getting into victim networks during the past year.
Microsoft disclosed last week that the hackers had been able to read the company’s closely guarded source code for how its programs authenticate users. At many of the victims, the hackers manipulated those programs to access new areas inside their targets. Smith stressed that such movement was not due to programming errors on Microsoft’s part but on poor configurations and other controls on the customer’s part, including cases “where the keys to the safe and the car were left out in the open”. George Kurtz, the CrowdStrike chief executive, explained that in the case of his company, hackers used a third-party vendor of Microsoft software, which had access to CrowdStrike systems, and tried but failed to get into the company’s email. Kurtz turned the blame on Microsoft for its complicated architecture, which he called “antiquated”. “The threat actor took advantage of systemic weaknesses in the Windows authentication architecture, allowing it to move laterally within the network” and reach the cloud environment while bypassing multifactor authentication, Kurtz said. Where Smith appealed for government help in providing remedial instruction for cloud users, Kurtz said Microsoft should look to its own house and fix problems with its widely used Active Directory and Azure.
“Should Microsoft address the authentication architecture limitations around Active Directory and Azure Active Directory, or shift to a different methodology entirely, a considerable threat vector would be completely eliminated from one of the world*s most widely used authentication platforms,” Kurtz said. The executives argued for greater transparency and information-sharing about breaches, with liability protections and a system that does not punish those who come forward, similar to airline disaster investigations. “It’s imperative for the nation that we encourage and sometimes even require better information-sharing about cyber-attacks,” Smith said. Lawmakers spoke with the executives about how threat intelligence can be more easily and confidentially shared among competitors and lawmakers to prevent large hacks like this in the future. They also discussed what kinds of repercussion nation-state sponsored hacks warrant. The Biden administration is rumored to be considering sanctions against Russia over the hack, according to a Washington Post report. “This could have been exponentially worse and we need to recognize the seriousness of that,” said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia. “We can’t default to security fatalism. We’ve got to at least raise the cost for our adversaries.” Lawmakers berated Amazon for not appearing at the hearing, threatening to compel the company to testify at subsequent panels. “I think [Amazon has] an obligation to cooperate with this inquiry, and I hope they will voluntarily do so,” said Senator Susan Collins, a Republican. “If they don’t, I think we should look at next steps.” Reuters contributed to this report."
2021-02-23T12:47:53Z,technology,Technology,Elon Musk no longer world’s richest person as Tesla shares fall,"Elon Musk, the maverick boss of Tesla, is no longer the world’s richest person after shares in the electric car company dropped 8.6% on Monday, wiping $15.2bn (£10.8bn) off his fortune. Musk, who last month leapfrogged Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to take the title of the world’s wealthiest person, dropped back into second place with a $183bn estimated fortune behind Bezos’ $186.3bn. The 8.5% drop in Tesla’s share price on Monday – the sharpest one-day fall since September – was partly fuelled by Musk tweeting that the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies “do seem high”. Tesla’s shares were down a further 6% in pre-market trading on Tuesday.
His comments came just two weeks after Tesla bought $1.5bn of bitcoin, which sent the price of the cryptocurrency to fresh highs. Bitcoin, which reached a high of $58,000 on Sunday, has since fallen to $47,500 on Tuesday morning. The price is still up more than 500% over the past year. Replying on Twitter to Peter Schiff, a stockbroker and gold investor, Musk said: “Money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter. That data, like all data, is subject to latency and error. The system will evolve to that which minimises both. That said, bitcoin and ethereum [another cryptocurrency] do seem high.” Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, which is managed by Tesla shareholder Baillie Gifford, was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 on Tuesday, down 11%. Baillie Gifford was the biggest faller on the FTSE 250, down 8%. Musk had last week said Tesla’s decision to buy $1.5bn in bitcoin was a company decision not driven by him. “Tesla’s action is not directly reflective of my opinion,” Musk said, again on Twitter. “Having some bitcoin, which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash, is adventurous enough for an S&P 500 company ... When fiat [government-issued] currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn’t look elsewhere. Bitcoin is almost as bs [bullshit] as fiat money. The key word is ‘almost’.” Tesla disclosed the bitcoin holding in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission last month. The company said it had “updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximise returns” to allow it to invest cash reserve in “alternative reserve assets including digital assets”. It said that since the decision was approved by its audit committee it had “invested an aggregate $1.5bn in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long term”. Musk has previously helped to drive the popularity of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and dogecoin, by regularly tweeting that he is a “supporter” of the cryptocurrencies. He has also joked that bitcoin is his “safeword”.
Last month, the price of bitcoin soared after Musk said he was a supporter of the cryptocurrency in an interview carried on Clubhouse, a new social media app designed for wealthy people. “I do think at this point bitcoin is a good thing,” he said. “And, so, I am a supporter of bitcoin. Like I said, I was late to the party, but I am a supporter of bitcoin. And I think, bitcoin is really on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional finance people.” He has previously changed his Twitter biography to “#bitcoin”. Musk also tweeted on Monday that Tesla’s Model Y Standard Range SUV would still be available “off the menu”, following reports from electric vehicle newsite Electrek that the model had been removed as an option online."
2021-02-23T11:55:27Z,technology,Technology,Clubhouse chatroom app closes down site rebroadcasting content,"Clubhouse, the audio-chatroom app that has emerged as the latest craze to consume Silicon Valley, has shut down a site that was rebroadcasting the platform’s content, renewing concerns over the service’s ability to provide security and privacy for its users. The app, currently available only on iPhones, allows users to quickly and easily set up and discover panel-style discussions, with a small group of speakers and potentially thousands of listeners in each room. It has been strictly limited since its launch in April, with users requiring an invitation before they can create an account. It initially gained popularity in the tech and venture capitalist community of the San Francisco Bay area. Its exclusivity has also encouraged some users to breach the company’s security. On Tuesday, Clubhouse announced it had permanently banned one such user, who had set up a relay that streamed the audio from multiple rooms to a website called OpenClubhouse. That would have helped users without an iPhone or without an invitation to the service to listen in on some of the platform’s elite conversations: tech figures including Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen have all appeared in Clubhouse chats. Even users who do have Clubhouse accounts cannot be guaranteed of access to those rooms, since the service caps attendance at 5,000 people, often leading to the creation of in-app “overflow rooms”. Clubhouse says it has set up safeguards to prevent a repeat of such an incident. While few users will be too concerned about the security lapse, which simply made already-public discussions more accessible, it has drawn further scrutiny of the platform’s previous failures. Much of Clubhouse’s tech is built on a Chinese startup called Agora, which provides the audio services on which the platform runs. That has raised alarms about the ability of the Chinese state to monitor or censor the service, which flourished briefly in the state before a crackdown this month blocked access. “At this time, I can’t recommend that individuals who might find themselves adverse to the security services of the PRC to use Clubhouse for sensitive conversations,” said Alex Stamos, a former Facebook security chief who researches trustworthy technology at Stanford University. The company has also faced criticism over its privacy practices. In order to invite friends and colleagues to the platform, users must upload their address book to the service, ostensibly to help them find friends who already have accounts. That means even people who do not want to join the service may have their personal data held by the app, if their friends have uploaded their details. It has also led to some alarming quirks: according to Stamos, for example, “FBI San Francisco” has 87 friends on Clubhouse, apparently because that many people have the bureau’s field office in their address book. Others have reported drug dealers and therapists showing up in their suggested friends list."
2021-02-23T10:00:26Z,technology,Technology,'We deserve more': an Amazon warehouse’s high-stakes union drive,"Darryl Richardson was delighted when he landed a job as a “picker” at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama. “I thought, ‘Wow, I’m going to work for Amazon, work for the richest man around,” he said. “I thought it would be a nice facility that would treat you right.”
Richardson, a sturdily built 51-year-old with a short, charcoal beard, took a job at the gargantuan warehouse after the auto parts plant where he worked for nine years closed. Now he is strongly supporting the ambitious effort to unionize its 5,800 workers because, he says, the job is so demanding and working for Amazon has fallen far below his expectations. Last August, five months after the warehouse opened, Richardson began pushing for a union in what is not only the first effort to organize an entire Amazon warehouse in the United States, but also the biggest private-sector union drive in the south in years. “I thought the opportunities for moving up would be better. I thought safety at the plant would be better,” Richardson said. “And when it comes to letting people go for no reason – job security – I thought it would be different.” He complained about the fast, unrelenting pace of work and about seeing co-workers terminated for falling behind Amazon’s production quotas. As a picker, Richardson takes merchandise out of large metal bins that robots carry to his workstation, and he then hurries to put the items in various totes that a conveyor belt takes to packing. Nearby video monitors tell him what to do minute after minute. His quota is to pick 315 items an hour, five items a minute: toilet paper and toys, baby food and books destined for Amazon customers. “You’re running at a consistent, fast pace,” Richardson said. “You ain’t got time to look around. You get treated like a number. You don’t get treated like a person. They work you like a robot.”
Working from 7.15am to 545pm four days a week, he complains that he often doesn’t get a break until 11.45, four and a half hours after he begins. While Amazon boasts about its pay levels, Richardson isn’t thrilled that the $15.55 he earns an hour is well below the $23.15 he received at the auto parts plant. Because of such frustrations, Richardson and other union supporters had little problem getting 30% of the warehouse’s workers to sign cards calling for a unionization election – the threshold needed to request an election. Richardson voices confidence that a majority of the Bessemer workers will vote to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) – that would be a landmark victory for labor and a stinging defeat for anti-union Amazon. If the union triumphs in conservative Alabama, labor experts say, that could pave the way to organizing Amazon fulfillment centers in more pro-union states, like California, Minnesota and New York. What’s more, a union win against Amazon would be a huge symbolic victory for the labor movement, which has seen its bargaining and political clout decline as the percentage of American workers in unions has dropped from 35% in the 1950s to less than 11% today.
Amazon has mounted a fierce campaign against the RWDSU. It texts several anti-union messages each day to workers. It has forced workers to attend “information” meetings where managers belittle unions. It even put anti-union posters in the bathroom stalls. “You go to the bathroom for privacy, but then you have a flyer right in your face,” Richardson said. “That feels like a type of harassment. That’s extreme to me.” The National Labor Relations Board mailed out ballots on 8 February, and the 5,800 workers are to mail back their ballots by 29 March. The labor board will then count the ballots, and if a majority of workers vote to unionize, Amazon will be required by federal law to recognize and bargain with the RWDSU.
This high-stakes union drive – in an area once known for steel mills and coalmines – has attracted attention across the US and even overseas. The NFL Players Association has endorsed the effort, and so has Bernie Sanders. Fifty House members wrote to Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s CEO, demanding that the company stop its “strong-arm tactics” and “allow your employees freely to exercise their right to organize”. Joseph McCartin, a professor of labor history at Georgetown, said Amazon was a good target for labor. “There’s a growing anti-Amazon appetite in the country,” he said. “There’s a growing sentiment that companies like Amazon have grown too powerful. They’ve reached a point where they have to be checked.” McCartin said winning a unionization campaign in the south can be tough; he pointed to labor’s high-profile losses at Nissan in Mississippi, Boeing in South Carolina and Volkswagen in Tennessee. He said that Amazon – with sales soaring to $125bn in its most recent quarter – was a “better target” for unions because “it has become enormously wealthy on jobs that are poorly paid and exploitative. It’s a bigger and more vulnerable target.” As for overseas attention, Uni Global Union, a Swiss-based federation of unions from 150 countries, helped persuade more than 70 investment firms and institutional investors with combined assets of over $6tn to demand that Amazon cease “all anti-union communications, including public statements, captive audience meetings, texts, websites, on-site billboards”. “An election of this size in Alabama with such an anti-union company is incredibly important,” said Christy Hoffman, Uni Global’s general secretary. “We want Amazon to realize that all eyes are on them. The captive audience meetings, the relentless text messages, the signs in the bathrooms, that kind of stuff is considered barbaric in Europe. It’s hard to imagine that a large multinational like Amazon would dare do that in Europe.” In an emailed statement, Rachael Lighty, an Amazon spokesperson, said: “We don’t believe the RWDSU represents the majority of our employees’ views. Our employees choose to work at Amazon because we offer some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire.” Lighty said the Bessemer facility offers starting pay of $15.30 an hour, more than twice the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage, as well as health coverage, dental and vision benefits, and a 50% 401(k) retirement savings match. “The fact is that Amazon already offers what unions are requesting for employees,” she said. To Stuart Appelbaum, the RWDSU’s president, it’s crucial to begin unionizing Amazon in the US because it is such a powerful, trend-setting company. (In Europe, many Amazon warehouses have unions.) With 800,000 workers nationwide, Amazon is the country’s second largest private-sector employer after Walmart, and with orders soaring during the pandemic, Amazon has added 400,000 workers worldwide over the past year.
“I feel we had no choice, that we had to go after Amazon,” Appelbaum said. “Amazon is transforming industry after industry. It’s going to determine the future of work. We cannot afford to have Amazon create a work environment that is dehumanizing and that prevents workers from asserting their right to have a safe workplace.” For Appelbaum, unions badly need to gain a foothold inside Amazon because it is playing a major role shaping the robot-filled workplace of the future. He wants to ensure that workers have a voice in building that workplace and making it more humane. “The pandemic has made more workers see the importance of having a union,” Appelbaum said. “It’s opened people’s eyes. There have been a lot of problems, and people understand they just can’t accept what their employer is saying about safety in the workplace.” Amazon workers complained that the company was slow to provide PPE and ensure adequate distancing, and that nearly 20,000 Amazon employees have caught Covid, although Amazon says its employees’ infection rate is lower than for the general population. Amazon says it has invested over $11.5bn on Covid-related efforts to keep its workers safe. Union leaders estimate that 85% of Amazon’s workforce in Bessemer, a suburb of Birmingham, is African American, and that, labor experts say, could be a big plus for the union campaign. Black workers are generally more pro-union than white workers. “We see this campaign as much as a civil rights struggle as a labor struggle,” Appelbaum said, adding that the Bessemer fight resembles the struggles for worker dignity that Martin Luther King Jr used to support. The RWDSU is quick to note that it was the first union to negotiate a contract guaranteeing King’s birthday as a paid holiday. Darryl Richardson also sees the union drive as a fight for dignity. “You don’t have time to leave your workstation to get water,” he said. “You don’t have time to go to the bathroom.” Those few minutes away (which Amazon tracks closely) can cause workers to fall behind on their production quotas, and too many minutes away can lead to termination. “I don’t like to see nobody, Black, white or green, get treated the way Amazon treats people,” he said. Richardson, who was active in the United Auto Workers union at his old factory, has high hopes that unionizing will improve jobs at Amazon. “The union will make it better when it comes to safety, job security, employees getting treated fair, better wages, making sure everybody gets respect, gets treated like they deserve to be treated, not just a robot, not just a number.” He notes that Amazon’s $15.30 starting pay is below what some nearby warehouses pay – he mentioned one that pays $18 an hour. “Amazon says they’re giving you great stuff that nobody else gives you, yet Amazon has big turnover,” he said. “You have employees leaving for somewhere else, where they don’t have to work as hard and you get the same pay and they treat you better. “We’re working for Amazon and one of the richest men in the world,” Richardson continued, referring to Bezos who is worth around $190bn. “I feel like we deserve more than what we’re getting.” ••• At 4:30 am, Mike Foster and other organizers begin standing on a road just outside the warehouse, distributing flyers and trying to talk to Amazon employees once they leave work. Dressed in a bright orange vest, Foster – a poultry worker whose plant was unionized by the RWDSU – hopes the Amazon workers will stop and talk for a minute and not speed by. Known as Big Mike, Foster exudes confidence, saying, “I’m being David, and I’m fighting Goliath, and we all know how this story ended.” The pandemic has prevented the RWDSU from using many tried-and-true tactics. No more house calls, where organizers sit down to explain the advantages of unionizing. No more large meetings and rallies that build momentum and solidarity. Instead, there are websites, videos and lots and lots of phone calls that talk up the benefits of unions. Sadatu Mamah-Trawill, a longtime organizer, often makes 60 calls a day to Bessemer employees, answering their questions about unions and responding to Amazon’s anti-union attacks. “People are told to be afraid of the union coming,” she said. “Every day they go into these meetings where Amazon tells them to vote no and gives them excuses why they should vote no. They’re going to lose wages. They’re going to lose benefits. All those lies.”
Mamah-Trawill explains that it is extremely unlikely that they will lose wages or benefits with a union, adding that if that happens, it will be Amazon’s fault. “My main message is what is going to happen after we win,” she said. “They will elect their co-workers to represent them on a negotiating committee. I let them know that we [outsiders] don’t make the decisions. We let them know that they are the union, that they make the decisions.” Some Amazon employees see no need for a union. Ora Mcclendon, a “packer”, said working at the warehouse is “great.” “The pay is great. The benefits are awesome,” she said. “You get your benefits from day one, but at many other companies, you have to wait 60, 90 days.” Mcclendon, 62, who had worked at a plastics factory, denied that the pace of work was too rapid or stressful. “I come from another packing plant,” she said. “I’m used to the culture. I don’t think it’s too fast. It’s fair, and it’s workable.” She praised the fulfillment center’s managers, saying they “stress teamwork”. At the same time, she voiced skepticism about the union: “I don’t know what they’re offering us. I talked to one of their leaders on the telephone, and I asked what they could bring to the table that we don’t already have, and he couldn’t give me anything. I don’t see why they want to be here.” Amazon has an anti-union website called doitwithoutdues.com that says, “Why pay almost $500 in dues? We’ve got you covered with high wages, health care, vision, and dental benefits.” At the mandatory meetings, Amazon’s managers often tell workers that they might lose more with a union than they would gain (although federal data show that unionized warehouse and transportation jobs pay 34% more on average than non-union ones). Managers also tell the workers that unions are a business that relies on dues. Jennifer Bates, a pro-union worker who helps train the warehouse’s employees, said, “They tell us different reasons why we shouldn’t get the union. They’re going to get your money. They’re poor people who are trying to get rich. They’re trying to get your money to go on vacation and get nice cars. You’ll be out $500. Why pay them your dollars?” At one meeting, Bates – knowing that Alabama is a “right-to-work” state – asked a manager, “Is it mandatory we pay dues?” “He answered, ‘It’s not mandatory’,” said Bates. At times, Amazon’s message has been that paying union dues is mandatory even though that statement is false – in right-to-work Alabama, workers at unionized companies can opt out of paying dues. After that anti-union meeting, Bates said, an Amazon official asked to photograph her badge. She called that intimidation: “I think it’s to show you’ll get in trouble for bringing up these types of questions.” Lighty, the Amazon spokesperson, said the company hosts information sessions for all employees and gives workers an opportunity to ask questions. “We are following all NLRB rules and guidelines as it relates to union campaigns,” she said. “We believe it is important for all employees to understand all sides of the vote and the election process.” Like Richardson, Bates, 48, complains about the relentless pace and the paucity of rest breaks. “A robot can work longer than we can,” she said. “We’re human. Our bodies get tired. I think Amazon understands that, but they don’t care.” Bates said that some co-workers are scared to support a union. “They’re afraid of losing their jobs,” she said. “One guy said he used to make $7 an hour and worked three times as hard and was glad to be making $15 now. He doesn’t ever want to go back to $7.” Union organizers said several managers had warned that the warehouse might close if the RWDSU wins. Amazon’s anti-union tactics are in many ways typical for corporate America. In a study of unionization drives, Kate Bronfenbrenner, a researcher at Cornell University, found that 89% of employers held mandatory anti-union meetings, 57% threatened to close operations if workers unionized, 47% threatened to cut wages or benefits, and 34% fired union supporters. (Under current law, there is no penalty for illegally firing workers for supporting a union.) John Logan, a professor of labor studies at San Francisco State, said that in the Amazon-RWDSU face-off, “there’s absolutely not a level playing field. The union is competing with a company that has unlimited access and all different ways of reaching employees.” But under federal law, corporations can even prohibit union organizers from setting foot on company property. Last February, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed the Protecting the Right to Organize Act (Pro Act), which includes many provisions that make it easier to unionize, including a ban on mandatory anti-union meetings and imposing fines on companies that fire workers for backing unions. Then the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, blocked a vote on it, although Democrats recently introduced the measure in the new Congress. “I don’t think there’s any amount of money Amazon won’t be prepared to spend to win,” Logan said. “If the RWDSU lost, it would be a tremendous disappointment. If Amazon loses, it’s a disaster, it’s a catastrophe for them.”
Most labor leaders hate it when anti-union companies call unions “businesses”, as Amazon often does. But Bren Riley, a former Goodyear factory worker and now president of the Alabama’s branch of AFL-CIO, the largest federation of unions in the US, had a surprising response, saying that unions are in ways a business. “We’re in the business of taking care of our members,” he said. “Our business is to keep you from going broke or getting broken. Remember, the old saying: ‘United we bargain. Divided we beg.’” Riley added that “our business” is also to keep workers from getting fired improperly. “If you’re fired because your breath stinks, hell, we’ll pay $8,000 to arbitrate your case to save your job. Yes, unions need money.” Despite Amazon’s anti-union attacks, Riley doesn’t talk of Amazon as an enemy. “We want to partner with Amazon once we get a first contract,” he said, although labor experts say Amazon might drag its feet on reaching a contract. “We want Amazon to succeed. We want Jeff Bezos to make another $10bn,” Riley said. “And we want employees to have a safe job. We want employees to be very productive. It don’t matter if it’s Jeff Bezos or Goodyear, we want them to make a bunch of money so when our three-year agreement is up, we can get a piece of it.” ••• Stewart Acuff, a native of Tennessee, used to be the AFL-CIO’s organizing director and has led dozens of union campaigns in the south, winning many of them, but losing a lot, too. Acuff says the union drive at Amazon “is a big uphill battle”. “I’ve been inside gigantic campaigns like this in the south,” he said. “I don’t have to tell you how hard they are in the private sector. A big thing the workers face is probably every institution in their community is lined up against them, except for the more courageous of the Black churches. In a place like Alabama, people have grown up learning to be hostile to unions. It’s not like Pittsburgh.” But some experts on the south say not so fast. They note that the Bessemer-Birmingham area is different from the rest of Alabama. It was the industrial hub, while the rest of the state focused on cotton and other agriculture. It was rich with iron ore, coal and limestone, raw materials that once made Bessemer and Birmingham booming steelmaking communities. Bessemer also had a Pullman railcar factory as well as strong labor unions. Some Amazon workers said their parents or grandparents were retired union members who urged them to sign union cards and vote union. “Birmingham and Bessemer produced a lot of labor militancy and solidarity over the years,” Georgetown’s McCartin said. That legacy, he said, could go far to deliver an RWDSU victory, even in conservative Alabama.
The union movement has faced some bitter defeats in the south in recent years. Labor experts said a major reason the UAW lost its organizing drives at Volkswagen in Chattanooga and Nissan in Mississippi was that it was seen as an outside interloper, as a carpetbagger. But with its long history in Alabama, the RWDSU, having unionized poultry plants and fought for civil rights, tells the Bessemer workers, we’re your neighbors, we’re part of Alabama, too. Appelbaum notes that his union has won major battles against other formidable companies in Alabama – unionizing 1,200 workers at the Pilgrim’s Pride poultry plant in Russellville in 2012. Some of those poultry workers are working as organizers in the Amazon campaign. Another big factor that could help the union win is racial solidarity. Bessemer’s population is 72% Black, and that helps explain the RWDSU’s notion that this is both a labor fight and a civil rights fight. “Viewing it through the lens of civil rights is going to make this take on a higher meaning, a more spiritual meaning,” said Keri Leigh Merritt, a historian who has written extensively on slavery and southern labor. “People are going to rise above their worries and unite over this higher calling. This is really something they can get behind.” The RWDSU reminds workers of its civil rights bona fides. It provided tents to the Selma civil rights marchers in 1965. It highlights Black RWDSU leaders who fought for civil rights. It reminds Amazon workers that the KKK used to threaten and shoot at RWDSU organizers. “One of the reasons this really might work is it’s a tie-in to civil rights and human rights,” said Michael Innis-Jiménez, a professor of American Studies at the University of Alabama. “It’s about much more than bread and butter.” This story was produced in partnership with the Century Foundation"
2021-02-22T17:51:17Z,technology,Technology,Uber accused of trying to deter drivers from seeking compensation,"Uber has been accused of trying to deter drivers from seeking compensation for missed holiday and minimum wage payments after a landmark court ruling. The taxi-hailing app may have to pay out more than £100m to more than 10,000 drivers involved in cases linked to a UK supreme court ruling on Friday that they must be classified as workers. Uber has previously argued that its 60,000 UK drivers are self-employed independent contractors with no right to holiday pay, a company pension or the national minimum wage. The case began when two drivers, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, took Uber to court on behalf of a group of about 23 others.
In a message to drivers after the ruling, Uber’s general manager for northern and eastern Europe, Jamie Heywood, said that as a result of the court’s decision “a small number of drivers from 2016 can be classified as workers, but this judgment does not apply to drivers who earn on the app today.” He said Uber had made significant changes to its business in recent years, including giving drivers more control over their earnings and bringing in new protections including free insurance in case of sickness or injury. One driver who received the message said: “After hearing about the court decision I was feeling slightly elated and thought at last things may change, but when I received the message from Uber it felt like a kick in the teeth saying it only applies to a few drivers.” Lawyers acting for the claimants argue that Heywood’s statement was misleading.
Nigel Mackay, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, which is acting for more than 2,200 drivers, said: “There is no way they can say ‘this doesn’t apply’ with confidence. To suggest that the changes they talk about have any impact on the supreme court findings, the effect of that is very misleading. Uber is trying to deter people from the claim with this message.” The firm believes the drivers are due about £12,000 in compensation each, which would cost Uber more than £26m. If Uber does not accept that the court’s ruling on Farrar and Aslam applies to all of its drivers, the linked cases will restart at the employment tribunal after being paused while the supreme court’s decision was awaited. Lawyers said hundreds more drivers had applied to join the claims since the ruling.
Mackay said the judgment was clear about specific factors which indicated Uber’s control of the drivers by, for example, setting the cost of a journey and handing out penalties related to users’ ratings. He said it was difficult to see that any of the changes to conditions Uber had talked about had changed that level of control. Andrew Nugent Smith, the managing director of the law firm Keller Lenkner, which is representing more than 8,000 drivers, was contacted by about 1,000 more over the weekend. It believes those already on its books could claim an average of £10,000 each in compensation, which would cost Uber about £80m. “To suggest that there is no impact at all on the wider driver community, and current conditions and working practices, is misleading,” he said. While the supreme court decision “did relate to historic terms and practices, that Uber has since changed, we are confident that drivers must still be treated as workers”. An Uber source denied the claim that Heywood’s message had misled drivers or was intended to deter them from seeking compensation. The source said the company was consulting about changes it could make to its working practices. It is expected to announce a response to the consultation within weeks and wants the government to consider how to ensure there is a level playing field with a response to the ruling across the whole ride-hailing industry."
2021-02-22T14:29:36Z,technology,Technology,WhatsApp to try again to change privacy policy in mid-May,"After an abortive attempt to change its privacy policy led to millions of users signing up for competing services, WhatsApp has said it will try for a second time to roll out the update in mid-May. In an effort to smooth the transition, WhatsApp will for the first time allow limited access to its services for users who do not agree to the new terms of service. From 15 May, those users will no longer be able to send or read messages but will continue to be able to receive calls and notifications for a “short time”. Eventually, those users will be cut off unless they accept the new terms. In the first three weeks of this year when WhatsApp initially attempted to change its terms, its competitors Signal and Telegram gained more than 30 million users between them. In January, viral posts – ironically, widely spread on WhatsApp – claimed the privacy policy gave the service the right to read users’ messages and hand the information over to its parent company, Facebook. “We’ve spent the last several weeks reviewing feedback from users and we spent time (virtually) with people from many countries,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said. “This was a great opportunity for us to hear about people’s concerns and learn what we could have done better. “People want to know that WhatsApp and Facebook cannot read or listen to personal conversations as they’re end-to-end encrypted. After that, people want to know that WhatsApp does not keep logs of who everyone is messaging and that we do not share contact lists with Facebook. This is our global approach to protecting people’s most private information and that’s not changing.” The company’s new terms of service are no different from those it attempted to introduce in January, but it hopes that a more verbose information screen, as well as more time to review the proposed changes, will allay users’ fears. If not, it hopes the short period of time when users will still be able to receive calls and notifications could tempt them back. According to TechCrunch, which first reported on the plans, users will be able to receive some contacts for a few weeks after the 15 May deadline. The knowledge that there are unanswered messages may be enough for many to take the leap and accept the new terms of service after all. The new terms of service are mainly focused on a set of features that allow businesses to connect shops on WhatsApp with similar services on the main Facebook app. That entails an unprecedented level of connection between the two services, which sparked the concern among some users."
2021-02-22T13:34:11Z,technology,Technology,No 10 'concerned' about Facebook news shutdown in Australia,"The UK government is “obviously concerned” at the repercussions of Facebook’s shutdown of large numbers of news and public information resources in Australia, Downing Street has said, confirming that the culture secretary will meet the US company this week. Oliver Dowden is “expecting to meet Facebook this week”, Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said, adding that the date had yet to be confirmed. Facebook has faced a wave of condemnation and negative publicity after it suspended Facebook pages for government bodies, health departments and charities along with those for news sites in Australia amid a row over a new law that would force it and other platforms to pay for links to news content. Johnson’s spokesperson said: “We are obviously concerned about access to news being restricted in Australia. As we always have done, we’ll be robust in defending free speech and journalism.”
The spokesperson was asked whether the UK could consider following suit in obliging Facebook and similar companies that make huge revenues linking to journalism to pay for this. He said the UK was setting up a unit “to promote competition in digital markets and ensure major tech companies cannot exploit a dominant market position”. This will be established within the government’s competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), from April, with a consultation to take place on the unit’s “form and function”. Asked whether it would look at an Australian-style system, the No 10 spokesperson said: “As part of the plans we will introduce a new statutory code of conduct that will support the sustainability of the news publishing industry, and try and help rebalance the relationship between publishers and online platforms.” Facebook’s actions in Australia have been condemned as an “attack on democracy” in an open letter from dozens of prominent charities, media and campaign groups around the world. On Monday, Microsoft announced a partnership with Europe’s publishers to develop an Australian-style system embedded in law to ensure content owners get fair payment when their news articles appear on tech sites. The move, a timely shot across the bows of Facebook and Google, will involve Microsoft working with Europe’s four leading lobby groups for newspaper and magazine publishers, and developing a regulated system to establish fair prices and “mandate payments” for the use of content by “gatekeepers that have dominant market power”. Fernando de Yarza, the president of News Media Europe, said: “The experiences in France and Australia have shown us that there’s a real need for a binding instrument to address inherent imbalances in bargaining power with gatekeepers, which undermine the potential of Europe’s press sector.” In an interview with the Financial Times on Monday, Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s chief executive, said the watchdog planned to launch a series of antitrust investigations into big tech companies this year. “Until we have these new legal powers, if we want to achieve impact for consumers in the UK, we need to use our current [tools],” he said. “There are quite a few cases against the digital platforms in Brussels today and a number of these include the UK market.” A Facebook spokesman said: “The UK has taken a very different approach to Australia, which has allowed us to strike commercial deals with almost every major UK publisher.” This involved the company paying tens of millions of pounds to national and local outlets to be part of the new Facebook News section. Facebook was also funding 80 trainee local reporters through its community news project, the spokesman said."
2021-02-20T22:15:43Z,technology,Technology,Charities condemn Facebook for ‘attack on democracy’ in Australia,"Members of Facebook’s oversight board, which some have likened to an internal “supreme court”, have been called on to speak out or step down after the platform shut down swathes of media and key public information sites during a battle with the Australian government. The social media giant suspended pages – including those of government bodies and state health departments before the national coronavirus vaccine rollout – as part of a showdown with officials over a new law that would force it and other platforms to pay for links to news content. That constituted an “attack on democracy”, an open letter from dozens of prominent charities, media and campaign groups around the world, including Save the Children Australia, Hope not Hate, and the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network, warned. “Access to reliable and quality information is integral to our democracy and our society,” the letter said. Taking it down, “gives room for misinformation and hate speech to fill the void left behind.” Facebook may wait up to a week before unblocking some of the pages of hundreds of non-media organisations caught up in its news ban, the Observer understands, while anti-vaccination content and misinformation continues to run rampant. Facebook has long argued, in response to calls for controls on its sprawling social media empire, that self-regulation is more effective than government regulation, pointing to bodies such as the oversight board. But that body moves slowly to judge only past controversies, so it cannot weigh in on fast-moving events as they happen, said Maria Ressa, the co-founder and CEO of Philippine news site Rappler, who was targeted by President Rodrigo Duterte for her work. It also has “no say on the design of the platform itself, which is where the problem lies”, she adds. As a member of the “Real Facebook Oversight Board”, a campaign body calling for more accountability, she also backs the open letter. The crisis in Australia has highlighted for her the problems with its current model. Rappler partners with Facebook to provide fact-checking on the site for news produced in the Philippines. But because the ban restricts Australian users and publishers from viewing or sharing all news, the country’s large Filipino diaspora has been effectively left vulnerable to misinformation, she said. “The thing that infuriated me was that every single news organisation from the Philippines is not visible in Australia. But the government propaganda (is) visible in Australia,” she said. “So now essentially, for Filipinos and the Filipino diaspora, you will see the lies, but you will not see the fact check.” That shows a massive disconnect between people in Facebook who say they are committed to keeping the site safe and supporting democracy, and those working on the business side and handling the Australian law, she said.
A senior executive has since apologised for taking down health and government sites, and prime minister Scott Morrison says Facebook is back at the negotiating table. But the company has publicly indicated no change in its opposition to the proposed law, which senior executives say sets “an unworkable precedent”. By contrast rival tech giant Google has struck more than 50 deals with Australian publishers to feature their journalism in its News Showcase product. Guardian Australia is the latest media company to reach an agreement, just days before the Senate debates the federal government’s news media code. “Quality journalism is both a public good and a highly valuable asset for publishers and platforms alike, as this deal demonstrates,” Dan Stinton, managing director of Guardian Australia, said of the deal. “We also congratulate the …Australian government on the development of the digital platforms and news media bargaining code, with this world-leading legislation providing the necessary regulatory environment to secure fair commercial deals that will sustain Australian journalism into the future.” The news media code would require Google and Facebook to negotiate payment for content from news publishers, and if no agreement can be reached, an arbiter will decide the financial terms of the deal."
2021-02-20T07:13:27Z,technology,Technology,Guardian Australia strikes deal with Google to join News Showcase,"Guardian Australia is the latest media company to strike a deal with Google to feature its journalism in the News Showcase product just days out from the Senate debating the federal government’s news media code. The multi-year commercial agreement was finalised after weeks of negotiation between Google and the Guardian’s leadership in Australia, as well as editorial and commercial staff in London. “We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Google because it will allow us to break more stories, provide more independent Australian journalism and reach more readers,” Guardian Australia editor Lenore Taylor said.
As part of Google Showcase, Guardian Australia will be able to control when and what Guardian stories are presented to readers in Showcase, and will have more control over how stories are presented in story panels in Google News. The agreement is one of over 50 Google has made with publishers in Australia, and over 500 in the world as part of News Showcase. In the past two weeks Google has been signing deals with Seven West Media, Nine, News Corp, as well as smaller players including Junkee Media. The ABC has yet to reach an agreement with Google. The 11th-hour deals were made as the federal government has pushed ahead with legislation for a news media bargaining code, which would require Google and Facebook to enter negotiations with news publishers for payment for content, and if no agreement can be reached, an arbiter will decide the financial terms of the deal. Google had said the worst-case scenario for the code would be to withdraw its search engine from Australia in response. The company quickly began signing agreements with several large media companies following negotiations with the federal government, indicating the government may be open to limiting the application of the code to the News Showcase product if enough publishers are on board. Guardian Australia’s managing director, Dan Stinton, told the Senate inquiry reviewing the legislation in January that the only reason Google had come to the table was because of the increasing regulatory pressure both in Australia and overseas. “To be clear: there is absolutely no way that there will be talks of doing deals on Facebook News or Google Showcase if that wasn’t the case.” In a statement Stinton pointed to the role the development of the code had played in leading to the deal. “We welcome the partnership with Google which recognises the benefits that Guardian journalism delivers and look forward to working with them to make this deal a success,” he said. “We also congratulate the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian government on the development of the digital platforms and news media bargaining code, with this world-leading legislation providing the necessary regulatory environment to secure fair commercial deals that will sustain Australian journalism into the future.” Google Australia and New Zealand managing director, Mel Silva, said Google was excited about the deal.
“The Guardian is one of Australia’s most popular news outlets with a huge presence in the country. Its quality journalism is known across the world – we are proud to welcome Guardian Australia to News Showcase,” she said. “The Guardian has a strong history breaking important stories across politics, health, the environment and provides a unique focus on Australian culture.” Legislation for the news media bargaining code is expected to be debated in the Senate next week. The other digital platform to be subject to the code, Facebook, has blocked news content from Australia in response to the code passing the House of Representatives this week. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, will continue discussions with Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerbeg about outstanding issues with the code over the weekend, and has indicated some amendments may be made."
2021-02-20T02:54:03Z,technology,Technology,"Google fires Margaret Mitchell, another top researcher on its AI ethics team","Google has fired one of its top artificial intelligence researchers, Margaret Mitchell, escalating internal turmoil at the company following the departure of Timnit Gebru, another leading figure on Google’s AI ethics team. Mitchell, who announced her firing on Twitter, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a statement to Reuters, Google said the firing followed a weeks-long investigation that found she moved electronic files outside the company. Google said Mitchell violated the company’s code of conduct and security policies. Google’s ethics in artificial intelligence research unit has been under scrutiny since December’s dismissal of Gebru, a prominent Black researcher in Silicon Valley. Gebru’s exit prompted thousands of Google workers to protest. Mitchell and Gebru co-led the ethics in artificial intelligence team for about two years.
Gebru and Mitchell, who is white, had called for more diversity among Google’s research staff and expressed concern that the company was starting to censor research critical of its products. Gebru said Google fired her after she questioned an order not to publish a paper claiming AI that mimics language could hurt marginalized populations. Google’s AI research director, Zoubin Ghahramani, and a company legal representative informed Mitchell’s team of her firing on Friday in a meeting called at short notice, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. The person said little explanation was given for the dismissal. Alex Hanna, an employee at Google, said on Twitter the company was running a “smear campaign” against Mitchell and Gebru, with whom she worked closely. Google did not immediately comment on those claims. In a statement to the Guardian, the company said: “After conducting a review of this manager’s conduct, we confirmed that there were multiple violations of our code of conduct, as well as of our security policies, which included the exfiltration of confidential business-sensitive documents and private data of other employees.” Google has recruited top scientists with promises of research freedom, but the limits are tested as researchers increasingly write about the negative effects of technology and offer unflattering perspectives on their employer’s products.

2021-02-20T02:51:43Z,technology,Technology,Australia v Facebook: PM claims tech giant 'back at the table' after executive's apology,"Australia’s prime minister says Facebook is back at the negotiating table after the tech giant this week blocked news on its site in the country. However, despite Scott Morrison saying Facebook has “tentatively friended us again”, the company has publicly indicated no change in its opposition to the proposed law requiring social media platforms to pay for links to news content. Senior Facebook Asia-Pacific executive Simon Milner was on Friday forced to apologise after the company banned access to accounts run by government bodies and state health departments.
This came before the national rollout of the coronavirus vaccine from Monday. Morrison on Saturday said he welcomed Milner’s apology, adding that Facebook’s closure of the public information accounts was indefensible. “My job now is to ensure we get on with those discussions, that we bring them to a successful conclusion,” Morrison told reporters. “The Australian government’s position is very clear, people would know the strong support being provided internationally for Australia’s position. “I’m pleased Facebook has decided, it would seem, to tentatively friend us again and get those discussions going again ... to ensure that the protections we want to put in place to ensure we have a free and democratic society that is supported by an open news media can continue.” Facebook initially claimed it had no choice but to shut health and emergency services pages down, arguing the media bargaining code was poorly worded. But it later pledged to reverse bans on pages inadvertently impacted. The Australian treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said on Friday he remained determined to convince Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to accept the media bargaining code. The pair spoke on Friday morning and will talk again over the weekend. The US social media behemoth first threatened to ban news for Australians in August and repeated the ultimatum before a Senate inquiry in January. The ban restricts Australian users and publishers from viewing or sharing news, and overseas users will be unable to access Australian news. “This is very much about Australia’s sovereignty, this is about Australia making laws for Australians, this is very much about the rules of the internet and the digital world replicating the rules of the physical world,” Frydenberg said. Morrison said the leaders of India, Canada and the United Kingdom were keenly watching Facebook’s reaction to the media code. The Canadian heritage minister, Steven Guilbeault, said on Thursday his country would adopt the Australian approach as it crafts its own legislation in coming months. The Australian law, which would force Facebook and Google to reach commercial deals with Australian publishers or face compulsory arbitration, has cleared the lower house of parliament and is expected to be passed by the Senate within the next week, despite Labor criticising the government for its handling of negotiations with digital platforms. The Australian opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said Facebook needed to accept that media companies should be paid for content to keep journalism alive, and said the company’s ban on news content would damage their reputation. At a parliamentary inquiry hearing on Friday, both News Corp executive chair Michael Miller and Nine chief executive Hugh Marks called on the government to stick to its plan to legislate the media bargaining code. Miller said the full impact of Facebook’s bans was yet to be understood. The US State Department said on Saturday that it considered Australia’s dispute with Facebook a private business matter for the two parties.
Google, which has initially threatened to close its search engine in Australia, has announced a host of preemptive licensing deals over the past week, including a global agreement with News Corp. Facebook’s move had an immediate impact on traffic to Australian new sites, according to early data from New York-based analytics firm Chartbeat. Total traffic to the Australian news sites from various platforms fell from the day before the ban by around 13% within the country. • Australian Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report"
2021-02-19T17:29:12Z,technology,Technology,Bitcoin's market value exceeds $1tn after price soars,"Bitcoin hit a new high on Friday, giving it a market value of more than $1tn for the first time. Bitcoin rose 6.4% during trading on Friday to reach an all-time high above $55,000, and was on track for a weekly gain of about 14%. The surge took its market capitalisation – the value of all bitcoin in circulation – to more than $1tn, according to the data website CoinMarketCap. On Wednesday, bitcoin burst through the $50,000 mark for the first time, as it continued to attract interest from mainstream investors and acceptance from financial institutions.
Bitcoin has enjoyed a meteoric rise in 2021, gaining more than 60% during the month of February alone. Its popularity has been boosted in recent weeks by high-profile purchases by the electric car company Tesla, run by the billionaire Elon Musk, while the US bank Morgan Stanley has said its investment fund is looking at a large purchase of bitcoins. Tesla sent bitcoin’s value skywards when it revealed earlier in February it had bought $1.5bn (£1.1bn) in bitcoin and said it might soon accept payment in the cryptocurrency. Musk has regularly tweeted that he is a supporter of cryptocurrencies, which have been favoured by some investors while global interest rates remain at record lows. He wrote on Twitter on Friday that bitcoin was a “less dumb form of liquidity than cash”. Despite their growing popularity, digital currencies remain controversial. Regulators including the Bank of England are sceptical about cryptocurrencies on account of their volatility and vulnerability to theft or hacking. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, told an online conference hosted by the World Economic Forum in January that he did not believe any existing cryptocurrencies would last in the long term.
Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride in the last few years. In March 2020 it was trading below $6,000. In 2016 a single coin was worth less than $400. Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at the financial trading platform Markets.com, noted that bitcoin had received “yet more institutional support”. He said the boss of the US investment firm DoubleLine Capital, Jeffrey Gundlach, a longtime proponent of investing in gold, “is backing bitcoin as the asset to insulate investors against the great monetary inflation”."
2021-02-19T17:28:01Z,technology,Technology,Misinformation runs rampant as Facebook says it may take a week before it unblocks some pages,"Facebook may wait up to a week before unblocking some of the pages of hundreds of non-media organisations caught up in its news ban, while anti-vaccination content and misinformation continues to run rampant on the social media platform. Content designated as news was blocked on Facebook in Australia on Thursday morning in response to the federal government’s news media code, which would require the tech giant to negotiate with news publishers for payment for content. The decision continued to make waves globally on Friday, with leaders at the virtual G7 summit discussing the issue and US legislators setting out plans for a series of related antitrust bills, starting with one that would make it easier for small news organisations to negotiate with tech giants by allowing them to work as a group. In Europe, the European Commission president urged the US to join the EU in creating “a digital economy rulebook that is valid worldwide”. Ursula von der Leyen cited the storming of the US capitol as “a turning point for our discussion on the impact social media have on our democracies”, adding: “We just cannot leave decisions, which have a huge impact on our democracies, to computer programmes without any human supervision or to the board rooms in Silicon Valley. The latest decision of Facebook regarding Australia is just another proof for that.” In the UK, Facebook’s Vice-President for Europe, the Middle East and Africa Nicola Mendelsohn defended the decision, telling LBC that the move would establish “an unworkable precedent” and arguing that “publishers choose to put their stories on our news feed because it allows them to sell more subscriptions, it allows them to grow their audiences, and ultimately to increase advertising revenue.” She emphasised that no similar moves were likely in the UK. But the social network was under pressure over the continued blocks on public service content affected by its action. It has blamed the situation on the government’s broad definition of what is considered to be “news” in the code. Hundreds of other pages have been barred from posting content, including health department and emergency services pages, family violence support pages, Western Australia opposition leader Zak Kirkup’s page, and even a page for mums in Sydney’s north shore.
Greg Inglis, the managing director of funeral business Picaluna, told Guardian Australia that Facebook had “killed off” his business’s page yesterday, just after he had paid for a marketing campaign on the platform. “We’re just at the very beginning of what for us is quite a big campaign where we’re going to spend quite a bit of money on Facebook,” he said. “And the irony is that they’re cutting off the hand that feeds them. It’s just crazy so it took me two hours down a rabbit hole of trying to find somewhere on Facebook’s website where you can actually contact them.” Inglis eventually found a live chat on Facebook where he had to explain his company was not a news business. “I spent the first 20 minutes of that live chat trying to explain that we’re a small to medium enterprise, we are not a media organisation. He kept coming back and saying ‘yes but you published stories’. I said ‘but we’re not a publisher they’re stories about funerals, we’re a funeral business’.” Inglis was told it could be 72 hours or more before someone would respond to the case lodged by Facebook support. Some other pages were restored on Thursday and Friday, but Guardian Australia understands it could be up to a week before many of the pages are even reviewed. Tim Hanslow, head of social at Preface Social Media and who also helps run the Australian Community Managers group on Facebook, told Guardian Australia he had heard from a couple of community managers who had been contacted by their Facebook representatives and were told an appeals process would be put in place for people to plead their case. He said in a post, shared with Guardian Australia, Facebook had applied the definition of news as per the definition in the code’s legislation. “But they are aware some pages have been incorrectly brought down by the ban. It’s clearly been done automatically. They’re compiling a list of pages incorrectly pulled down,” he said. “An appeals process for the ban will launch on Feb 25 and you can request your page be assessed as outside the news ban. All of the government pages/sites caught up in this should be reinstated.” Guardian Australia has sought comment from Facebook. Australian news sites recorded a steep decline in traffic as a result of the block. Audience tracking company Nielsen reported total sessions for news content declined 16% on Thursday compared with the last six Thursdays, while total time spent declined 14%. The company said 22% of the audience of Australian media publishers in 2020 accessed their content via the Facebook app. Social tracking website Chartbeat also reported overnight that Australian news sites recorded a decline of more than 20% in traffic due to Facebook cutting off news sites. Prior to the change, about 15% of visits to sites within Australia were being driven by Facebook, but after the change, that had dropped to less than 5%, the company said. Although satire sites Betoota Advocate and The Chaser were also initially hit by the ban, they managed to have the blocks removed, and as a result accounted for nine out of the Top 10 posts by Australian pages on engagement on Thursday.
The Chaser said on its Facebook page on Friday the attention had brought down the website. “Our first foray into real journalism has been so popular it completely crashed our website. We’re beginning to understand why the Herald-Sun never publishes proper journalism.” Also immune was the YouTube satirist Jordan Shanks, who operates under the moniker Friendlyjordies. Despite promoting himself as a comedian, Shanks has worked with the independent Australian journalist Michael West on stories about New South Wales deputy premier John Barilaro, and would probably fall under Facebook’s application of the government’s proposed definition of “news”. West’s page was hit by the news ban. Separately, dozens of pages and groups dedicated to promoting conspiracy theories, anti-vaccination misinformation and the alt-right have continued to operate unhindered by the company’s broad-brush ban on news content. In most cases, the groups were able to continue posting misinformation via YouTube and websites which escaped Facebook’s definition of news, profoundly reshaping how Australians consumed information on the social media behemoth. One 7,000-member group, which is dedicated to promoting the baseless conspiracy that the 1996 Port Arthur massacre was staged, posted an edited video which uses a 2015 speech by former Liberal party senator Bill Heffernan to falsely allege the existence of a widespread pedophilia network in Australian politics. The conspiracy theory, which has become a key tenet of Australia’s QAnon community, has been shared twice since the ban was introduced. In another Australian group, which is dedicated to vaccination misinformation, links to websites pushing that group’s agenda continued to be visible after the ban, as did posts containing false information about the soon-to-be-released Covid-19 vaccine.
Facebook’s ban also missed alt-right operators such as Avi Yemini, who has previously been banned from Facebook for hate speech and has become a key part of the growing conspiracy movement in Australia by promoting a steady stream of content linked to and shared by the anti-lockdown and anti-vaccination groups. Despite calling himself a “journalist”, Yemini and his associated pages continued to post unencumbered to his more than 100,000 followers on Friday. Other far-right pages, including one identified by the Guardian’s hate factory investigation, which uncovered a global network of far-right hate operating for profit through Facebook, also remained unhindered. The Australian government is trying to resolve issues with Facebook, but there is no clear timeline on when or if news media will be restored. Federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg held his second meeting in two days with Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg about the company’s ongoing issues with the code, and said on Friday the pair would talk again over the weekend.
The legislation for the code passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday night, and is expected to be debated in the Senate as soon as next week. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, repeated that the government would not be backing down from the code. “I would just say to Facebook: this is Australia, if you want to do business here, you work according to our rules. That is a reasonable proposition. We’re happy to listen to them on the technical issues of this, just like we listened to Google and came to a sensible arrangement,” he said. “But the idea of shutting down the sorts of sites they did yesterday, as some sort of threat, I know how Australians react to that and I thought that was not a good move on their part. “They should move quickly past that, come back to the table and we will sort it out.”"
2021-02-19T15:54:04Z,technology,Technology,Nvidia's new gaming software puts brakes on mining cryptocurrency,"The newest graphics cards from the gaming processor designer Nvidia will be artificially constrained in their ability to mine cryptocurrencies, the company has announced, as it desperately tries to manage a year-long inability to satisfy demand. The RTX 3060, a high-powered PC peripheral designed to let gamers get the best performance from their machines, will ship with software that makes it half as effective at mining the cryptocurrency Ethereum as it could be. “We designed GeForce GPUs for gamers, and gamers are clamouring for more,” said Nvidia’s Matt Wuebbling, the global head of GeForce marketing. “Yet Nvidia GPUs are programmable. And users are constantly discovering new applications for them, from weather simulation and gene sequencing to deep learning and robotics. Mining cryptocurrency is one of them.” To make up for the limitations, Nvidia is also launching a separate product line, marketed as cryptocurrency mining processors, which lack video output. Useless for gamers, they could lower the cost of entry for cryptocurrency miners. The company’s struggle highlights the pressure the cryptocurrency sector is imposing on other parts of the economy. Cryptocurrency mining requires ready access to extremely fast processors and cheap electricity. Processor designers such as Nvidia have struggled to keep up with demand from gamers alone during the pandemic, and extra pressure from cryptocurrency miners has led to long-term sales shortages and rocketing prices on eBay. Electricity markets have also suffered from the soaring price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Earlier this year, Iran blamed bitcoin miners for rolling blackouts, with the government saying the low cost of electricity, which can cost just 5% of the UK price, had acted as an incentive to huge numbers of miners to set up in Iran. One mine alone was using 175MW of electricity, the government said."
2021-02-19T15:06:32Z,technology,Technology,'It cuts out the faff': young people turn to TikTok for cooking tips,"Anna Spearing started baking when she was about eight or nine, making ginger biscuits in the family kitchen in Southampton and watching endless YouTube videos full of “really yummy ingredients”, in a period she refers to as “the simpler times”. Now 15, she is still baking, though the recipes have become more diverse, and the videos snappier and much shorter. Having discovered TikTok, the social video-sharing platform used by all her friends, she now frequently cooks dishes based on its 60-second viral videos, soundtracked by earworm songs and edited at rat-a-tat speed. Lockdown has sent her interest in cooking into overdrive, she says, “because it’s one of the only things left to do. [When her school was open] I barely cooked at all. Whereas now I cook supper twice a week, and I’ll bake two or three times a week, which I never would have been able to do before. I mean, it’s one of the things that brings joy nowadays.”
Among all the disadvantages heaped upon young people through this pandemic, many have discovered at least one unexpected blessing: a new interest in cookery sparked, in many cases, by TikTok. Precise figures on the phenomenon are difficult to quantify, but the social network, which is still dominated by its Chinese audience and claims more than 1 billion active monthly users worldwide, has soared in popularity in the UK particularly over the past year, where it is downloaded more than a million times a month and is expected to reach 10 million users by the end of 2021. The largest group of these are aged 18-24, but many are much younger. Highly addictive to its fans, and frequently baffling to those new to the platform, TikTok is based around short, jumpy videos which can be watched and shared, and thrives on viral memes. While dance and music trends tend to predominate, countless thousands of food videos are uploaded weekly, churned by its algorithm and served again and again to users who show any interest in the topic. “It’s really easy to get sucked into it,” says 17-year-old Lois Turkington from Belfast, who also uses Snapchat and Instagram to chat to her friends, but for the long months stuck indoors has mostly relied on TikTok. “You’ll click on one link and then half an hour later, you’re still on it.” She has also found herself turning to TikTok recipes for lunches and snacks, particularly while negotiating with her parents and siblings who are also using their kitchen. “They just cut out a lot of the faff, there aren’t all the extra bits. It just says, add this, add that, stick it in the oven. Instead of all the details that a recipe will go into.”
As cooking has become more popular on the platform, so have some of the dishes, which often do particularly well if labelled as an ingenious “hack” or shortcut. A simple recipe for whipped, Korean-style coffee gained instant popularity last year; more recent favourites on the platform have included an inventive way to fold a tortilla and a one-pot pasta sauce based on tomatoes and feta cheese. One spectacular beneficiary of the surge of interest in cookery on the platform is Poppy O’Toole, who this time last year was a busy, Michelin-trained London chef with only a passing knowledge of TikTok. After losing her job due to lockdown, the 27-year-old “felt a bit lost”, and decided to record a few cookery videos from home to upload on to the network.
A clip on how to recreate McDonald’s hash browns on her feed @poppycooks got some press attention. “And then I did a video of some crispy cube potatoes I was having for dinner, and it got 100,000 views. “That’s when I began to see what my audience wanted. Something like crispy potatoes – it has just rocketed. And that is how I’ve got to where I am today – because of the humble potato.” What she means is 1.4 million followers and a publishing deal with Bloomsbury for a cook book to be published later this year. Many of her followers are young people who may have tried out the viral food hacks, but have found themselves falling in love with slightly more challenging cookery, says O’Toole. “Those trends like the [whipped] coffee, they’re good fun. But people need to be able to take away actual skills. “So here’s a skill set to make it easier for you, and at the end of the day you can say, I made that, and it’s delicious, and show off.” For siblings Emily and Dominic Bool, 15 and 13, who live with their British family in Zurich, cooking from TikTok is part of daily life; Emily likes making cakes, often basing her decoration on viral tips, while Dominic recently cooked the family steak and chips based on a recipe on the app. Do they think TikTok has made cooking cool for people their age? “Definitely,” says Dominic. “Because when your parents tell you to cook, it’s kind of, you know … it feels like a big process. But if you are seeing a really pleasant video, it doesn’t seem so bad any more, not like you are being compelled to do it.”"
2021-02-19T12:53:01Z,technology,Technology,Maths app targeting UK schools is criticised over premium model,"A mobile game used by schools to teach maths through a fantasy role-playing world has been accused of unfairly manipulating children into paying more than $100 a year for premium items. Prodigy, which offers versions for in-school and at-home play, is the centre of a complaint to the US Federal Trade Commission submitted by a coalition of children’s rights groups led by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC). “While it does cost nothing for schools to implement Prodigy, the in-school version encourages children to play at home,” CCFC says in its complaint. “And when children play at home, they are met with a steady stream of advertisements promoting a ‘premium annual membership’ that costs up to $107.40.” The advertising tactics are standard for free-to-play games: members of the “premium” membership have exclusive access to a plethora of cosmetic items, and those without are constantly reminded of that fact. “The avatars of kids without memberships literally walk in dirt while those of kids with memberships ride around on clouds,” CCFC says. Prodigy’s biggest markets are the US, Australia and Canada, where it is among the top 100 educational apps. In the US alone it is reportedly used by “millions” of students across more than 90,000 schools. And the company has eyes on expansion to the UK: it advertises itself to teachers as offering “curriculum-aligned” maths problems for years one to six of the English schooling system. Prodigy argues that its platform is age-appropriate. “No paid subscription is required for students to continue receiving completely free access to all of the educational content in the game, which has been designed by our team of accredited teachers,” a spokesperson said. “Like all services with subscription models, we do surface the benefits of our membership features from time to time to make users aware that memberships exist and what their benefits might be.” Crucially, the visible advantages of a premium subscription are retained even when playing at school, where adverts for the paid features are otherwise disabled. “Prodigy’s model is the equivalent of giving wealthy kids in a classroom a shiny new textbook with a surprise toy inside, while kids from low-income families get an old, beaten-up edition,” CCFC said. “And as kids play, they can tell who are the haves and have-nots.” In a wider campaign, CCFC is pushing for Google to implement a slew of standards to protect children on its app store. The group says Google should adopt stricter rules for apps marked as “for children”, requiring a human review of each app and banning in-app purchases, unfair advertising and illegal data collection."

2021-02-18T20:48:13Z,technology,Technology,Facebook under fire over move to 'bully democracy' in Australia,"Politicians, news providers and civil society groups in the UK and US have rounded on Facebook and said the company’s decision to block all media content on its platform in Australia should hasten moves to bring its powers under control. In a step condemned as “an attempt to bully a democracy” and “threatening to bring an entire country to its knees”, Facebook stopped its 18 million Australian users from viewing or sharing news stories overnight in an escalating row over whether it should have to pay media companies for its content. It said the new rules “ignore the realities” of its relationship with news publishers. While Google has struck preemptive deals with several outlets ahead of the introduction of Australia’s news media code, Facebook’s defiance of legislators prompted fierce attacks in Australia and on both sides of the Atlantic. After Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, called the company’s actions “as arrogant as they were disappointing”, Julian Knight, the chair of the British parliament’s digital, culture, media and sport committee, said: “This action – this bullyboy action – that they’ve undertaken in Australia will I think ignite a desire to go further among legislators around the world.” Knight said that the battle was now “a real test case” for how tech giants should be regulated and asked to pay for content. His view was echoed in the US, where David Cicilline, who chairs the influential House antitrust committee, suggested that the move was “not compatible with democracy”.
“Threatening to bring an entire country to its knees to agree to Facebook’s terms is the ultimate admission of monopoly power,” the Democrat said on Twitter, posting a link to an article on Facebook’s decision. Facebook’s adoption of a hard line in the dispute came days before a vote on the code in Australia’s upper house that is expected to pass. The new rules require it and Google to reach commercial deals with news outlets whose links drive traffic to their platforms, or be subjected to forced arbitration to agree a price. Australia’s government says the code is aimed at “levelling the playing field” between the tech firms and struggling publishers, which have lost substantial advertising revenue to the US giants over the last decade. The legislation is widely seen as a test case for global regulators considering a push to extract more revenue from internet giants for content providers. But while Facebook’s action will be seen as an attempt to avoid accepting a precedent which could harm its business all over the world, the unintended consequences of its move immediately complicated its case against Morrison’s government. As well as conventional news outlets, government pages – including on bushfires, mental health, emergency services and even meteorology – were also blocked, as were community, women’s health and domestic violence support pages. Facebook said it would quickly reverse those blocks, and blamed the Australian government’s definition of news content in the media bargaining code for the “inadvertent” step – an interpretation the government rejects. There were also concerns that the decision would make it far harder to challenge misinformation propagated by Facebook users quoting unreliable sources. Facebook said that its commitment on the subject “has not changed” and that it will continue to direct people to authoritative information and review misleading content. Morrison wrote on Facebook: “Facebook’s actions to unfriend Australia today, cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services, were as arrogant as they were disappointing. They may be changing the world, but that doesn’t mean they run it.” In the UK, the government said that it was “vital” that the public be able to access accurate news and information, particularly during a global pandemic. A statement added: “We encourage Facebook and the Australian government to work together to find a solution.” Canada’s heritage minister Steven Guilbeault said Facebook’s move was “highly irresponsible.” Guilbeault said that “it won’t deter us from moving ahead” with similar legislation there. Dietmar Wolff, head of the BDZV news publishers’ association in Germany, said: “It is high time that governments all over the world limit the market power of the gatekeeper platforms.” Civil society leaders and media groups also condemned Facebook. Tim O’Connor from Amnesty International Australia said it was “extremely concerning” that a private company was willing to control access to information on which people rely. “Facebook’s action starkly demonstrates why allowing one company to exert such dominant power over our information ecosystem threatens human rights,” O’Connor said. Elaine Pearson, the Australia director at Human Rights Watch Australia, said it was a “dangerous turn of events. Cutting off access to vital information to an entire country in the dead of the night is unconscionable.” But Bernard Keane, the political editor of the Crikey website, defended Facebook and said the move was “the result of a staggering miscalculation by a government that thought it could run an extortion racket at the behest of the Murdochs on the widely reviled big tech companies”. In the UK, Guardian Media Group, which owns the Guardian and the Observer, said Facebook’s action cleared the way for the spread of misinformation at a time when facts and clarity are sorely needed. “We believe that public interest journalism should be as widely available as possible in order to have a healthy functioning democracy,” a spokesman said. “We have consistently argued that governments must play a role when it comes to establishing fair and transparent regulation of online platforms.” MailOnline said it was “astonished by this inflammatory move”. And Henry Faure Walker, the chair of the News Media Association, said Facebook’s ban during a pandemic was “a classic example of a monopoly power being the schoolyard bully, trying to protect its dominant position with scant regard for the citizens and customers it supposedly serves”. Facebook’s position in the UK ecosystem is quite different, with Facebook News launching last month, involving commercial deals with a number of major publishers. That move has been seen as a strategic play aimed at suggesting that others should not follow Australia’s lead. EU countries do not face the same situation as Australia because of new copyright rules that protect publishers in Europe, the bloc’s executive has said."

2021-02-18T15:05:00Z,technology,Technology,"Facebook is 'schoolyard bully' in Australia news row, says UK media boss","Facebook’s move to block all media content in Australia shows why countries need robust regulation to stop tech firms behaving like a “schoolyard bully”, the head of the UK’s news media trade group has said. Henry Faure Walker, the chair of the News Media Association, said Facebook’s ban during a pandemic was “a classic example of a monopoly power being the schoolyard bully, trying to protect its dominant position with scant regard for the citizens and customers it supposedly serves”. Australians have been blocked from viewing or sharing news on the social network in an escalation of a row over whether Facebook should have to pay media companies for displaying their content. Facebook is opposed to the federal government’s news media code, which will require it and Google to reach commercial deals with news outlets whose links drive traffic to their platforms, or be subjected to forced arbitration to agree a price. Google and Facebook have said the code unfairly penalises their platforms. The legislation, which the government says is aimed at “levelling the playing field” between the tech firms and struggling publishers, is expected to be passed by the Australian parliament within days, prompting Google to agree preemptive deals with several outlets in recent days. Overnight on Wednesday Facebook – which is used by 18 million Australians – prevented the sharing of news and wiped clean the pages of media companies, including the public broadcaster’s television, radio and non-news pages. Government pages – including on bushfires, mental health, emergency services and even meteorology – were also blocked, as were community, women’s health and domestic violence support pages. Faure Walker said: “Facebook’s actions in Australia demonstrate precisely why we need jurisdictions across the globe, including the UK, to coordinate to deliver robust regulation to create a truly level playing between the tech giants and news publishers.” Julian Knight, the chair of the British parliament’s digital, culture, media and sport committee, echoed Faure Walker when he told Reuters: “This action – this bullyboy action – that they’ve undertaken in Australia will I think ignite a desire to go further amongst legislators around the world. “We represent people and I’m sorry but you can’t run bulldozer over that – and if Facebook thinks it’ll do that it will face the same long-term ire as the likes of big oil and tobacco.” Guardian Media Group, which owns the Guardian and the Observer, said Facebook’s action cleared the way for the spread of misinformation at a time when facts and clarity are sorely needed. “We believe that public interest journalism should be as widely available as possible in order to have a healthy functioning democracy,” a spokesman said. “We have consistently argued that governments must play a role when it comes to establishing fair and transparent regulation of online platforms.” Hours before Facebook’s move, Google and Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp signed a multi-year partnership that will lead to the search engine paying for journalism from news sites around the world including the Wall Street Journal, the Times and the Australian. Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Thursday that Facebook’s show of strength would “confirm the concerns that an increasing number of countries are expressing about the behaviour of big tech companies who think they are bigger than governments and that the rules should not apply to them”. He wrote on Facebook: “Facebook’s actions to unfriend Australia today, cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services, were as arrogant as they were disappointing. They may be changing the world, but that doesn’t mean they run it.” The federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the ban confirmed the “immense market power of these media digital giants. These digital giants loom very, very large in our economy and on the digital landscape. The Morrison government remains absolutely committed to legislating and implementing the code.” Tim O’Connor from Amnesty International Australia said it was “extremely concerning” that a private company was willing to control access to information on which people rely. “Facebook’s action starkly demonstrates why allowing one company to exert such dominant power over our information ecosystem threatens human rights,” O’Connor said. Elaine Pearson, the Australia director at Human Rights Watch Australia, said it was a “dangerous turn of events. Cutting off access to vital information to an entire country in the dead of the night is unconscionable.” Facebook blamed the Australian government’s definition of news content in the media bargaining code for the “inadvertent” blanket ban on government pages – an interpretation the government rejects. “Government pages should not be impacted by today’s announcement,” a Facebook spokesperson said. The company said it would reverse the ban on those pages, and by midday on Thursday some pages had been restored, including those run by the Bureau of Meteorology and the state health departments. Facebook argues that the British media market is different, after it launched Facebook News through partnerships with publishers such as the Daily Mail group, the Financial Times, the Guardian and the Telegraph. EU countries do not face the same situation as Australia because of new copyright rules that protect publishers in Europe, the bloc’s executive has said. Reuters contributed to this report"
2021-02-18T07:59:17Z,technology,Technology,"Even for a company that specialises in PR disasters, Facebook has excelled with its Australian blackout | Emily Bell","When Facebook removed vast swathes of Australian media from its platform overnight on Wednesday the social media company intended to shock the system of Australian government and media cronyism and send a strong message to regulators everywhere. Instead, Facebook managed to turn attention away from a flawed piece of legislation and on to its own reckless, opaque power. Even for a company that specialises in public relations disasters, this was quite an achievement. Everyone from the head of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to the organiser of the North Shore Mums page found their links and pages missing from Facebook. Campus newspaper reporters, half of the editors in the First Nations media network, public health officials preparing for the Covid vaccine rollout and weather services found their Facebook presence suddenly, without warning wiped away.
A company that cannot reliably identify legitimate news sites or make a determination between a vital information service and the conspiracy-laden Epoch Times (which was also cut off) should not be part of a country’s critical communications infrastructure. Yet this is the Facebook paradox. Facebook had not thought whether the week before vaccines roll out was appropriate timing for a news blackout. Facebook and Google have, over the past three years, been sprinkling grants on journalism organisations and newsrooms at the rate of $100m a year each, making them the largest philanthropists and supporters of journalism on the planet. The money is not a deep commitment to producing equity and integrity in news; it is a lobbying exercise, a hedge against external regulation. Facebook’s news blackout was a pushback against the Australian government’s mandatory news bargaining code which proposes a system for negotiated payments from platforms to publishers for links to news articles. Australian media policy is rarely a focal point of global interest but the bargaining code is being watched closely from Menlo Park to Manila. Australia is a test case for resisting the idea that the digital advertising duopoly of Google and Facebook should set their own rules and policies for shaping the media landscape they dominate. The code has been criticised as badly drawn legislation which undermines the workings of an open web, or a Faustian pact between Scott Morrison’s government and Rupert Murdoch, or both. Even those who want to see a transfer of wealth from big tech to underfunded journalism were unsure that this was the right way to do it. Facebook released a statement on Wednesday stating that regrettably it was abandoning its plans to “significantly increase our investments with local publishers” and instead pulled the plug. Google meanwhile has managed to sidestep the proposition of a “link tax” by delivering the government’s objective of lucrative deals with Australian media companies from News Corp down to the smallest publishers. By flexing a little Google has for now avoided mandatory payment arbitration. Initial worries that the proposed system would prove inequitable has somewhat been allayed by Google’s negotiations with publishers so far. Facebook’s behaviour underlines however that without a regulated solution, sudden market withdrawal has an outsized impact on both smaller and public service outlets, who have not had the resources or incentives to build paywalled businesses away from social platforms. The arbitrary and hopefully temporary vandalism perpetrated by Facebook, raises the question of “What next?” Facebook already seemed to be trying to restore the pages it had purged in error – including rather comically its own corporate page. But the ABC and other news provider pages remained empty.
The untidy withdrawal from Australian news highlights how vulnerable entire countries can be to dependency on unreliable and unregulated distribution networks. It is also a reminder that at heart, neither Google or Facebook are primarily motivated by supporting journalism at all costs, or by providing transparency and accountability. Governments have arguably not paid nearly enough attention to producing alternative digital solutions to giant centralised advertising companies that provide an increasing number of communication services for their citizens. Facebook’s petulance has inadvertently made a case in Australia for more regulation rather than less. News organisations need to develop alternative platforms, and governments need to provide more regulated certainty. Highly digital newsrooms that have resources and strong relationships with their audiences started moving away from Facebook a long time ago, and are less affected by its volatility. Smaller publishers, and those with communities with low resources themselves, are much more dependent. A withdrawal from Facebook could be a galvanising moment for Australia, and beyond. The main problem with legislation that seeks to fund a news industry directly from Facebook and Google, is that it does not forge a clear path away from the duopoly entirely. Maybe the events of this week will help Australia and the countries watching its progress realise that the issue is not too much regulation, but too little."
2021-02-18T07:40:18Z,technology,Technology,Prime minister Scott Morrison attacks Facebook for 'arrogant' move to 'unfriend Australia',"The Australian government has been blindsided by Facebook suddenly blocking all news on the platform in Australia but says the â€œheavy-handedâ€� move will not stop parliament from passing landmark laws to force tech giants to pay for journalism. Australians woke up on Thursday to discover they couldnâ€™t view or share news on the social network after Facebook blocked the content in an escalation of a row over whether it should have to pay media companies for displaying their content. Facebook is opposed to the federal governmentâ€™s news media code which has already passed the lower house of parliament and is expected to soon pass the upper house. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, took to Facebook on Thursday to argue the platformâ€™s show of strength would â€œconfirm the concerns that an increasing number of countries are expressing about the behaviour of BigTech companies who think they are bigger than governments and that the rules should not apply to themâ€�.
â€œFacebookâ€™s actions to unfriend Australia today, cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services, were as arrogant as they were disappointing,â€� Morrison wrote on Facebook. â€œThey may be changing the world, but that doesnâ€™t mean they run it.â€� The federal communications minister, Paul Fletcher, warned that companies that operate in Australia â€œneed to comply with the laws passed by the elected parliament of this nationâ€�. A string of ministers told parliament on Thursday that Facebookâ€™s move was â€œan assaultâ€� on democracy and would damage the companyâ€™s reputation. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, condemned Facebookâ€™s decision to block Australiansâ€™ access to government pages in the middle of a pandemic â€“ including on bushfires, mental health, emergency services and even the Bureau of Meteorology â€“ saying they were â€œcompletely unrelatedâ€� to the proposed news media bargaining code.
The Facebook ban came a day after the government celebrated the passage of its world-first news media code through the lower house and just hours after News Corp signed a global deal with Google to pay for news content in its publications in Australia, the UK and the US. Google has made individual commercial deals with dozens of Australian publishers outside of the media code including Nine Entertainment and Seven West Media. They are reportedly worth tens of millions of dollars each. Facebook had been relatively quiet until it astounded the government with the unprecedented blocking on Thursday. The social media platform, used by 18 million Australians, prevented the sharing of news and wiped clean the pages of media companies, including the public broadcasterâ€™s television, radio and non-news pages, and inadvertently wiped community, womenâ€™s health and domestic violence support pages in the process.
Frydenberg said the ban confirmed the â€œimmense market power of these media digital giantsâ€�. â€œThese digital giants loom very, very large in our economy and on the digital landscape,â€� Frydenberg said. â€œThe Morrison government remains absolutely committed to legislating and implementing the code.â€� Facebook blamed the governmentâ€™s definition of news content in the media bargaining code for the â€œinadvertentâ€� blanket ban on government pages on Facebook â€“ an interpretation the government rejects. â€œGovernment pages should not be impacted by todayâ€™s announcement,â€� a Facebook spokesperson said. The company said it would reverse the ban on those pages.
â€œThe actions weâ€™re taking are focused on restricting publishers and people in Australia from sharing or viewing Australian and international news content,â€� Facebook said. â€œAs the law does not provide clear guidance on the definition of news content, we have taken a broad definition in order to respect the law as drafted.â€� Frydenberg said he had a lengthy â€œconstructiveâ€� talk to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg after the ban was imposed and said there were â€œsome differing interpretations as to how the code would workâ€�. The treasurer signalled there may be room for negotiation and he would â€œclarify some the issues with Facebookâ€� over the next few days. The government had already made minor changes to the code in line with some of the complaints Google had about its original form.
â€œWe want commercial agreements under the code, we want to implement and legislate the code, and we want the major players to stay here in Australia and to keep providing the services to Australians that Australians so enjoy,â€� Frydenberg said. â€œSo we are going to work through those issues with Facebook.â€� The News Corp Australasia executive chairman, Michael Miller, said Facebookâ€™s â€œdisappointingâ€� move â€œclearly encourages fake news over reliable news and demonstrates the extraordinary market power Facebook holdsâ€�. One of the news websites that gets a lot of traffic from Facebook, Daily Mail Australia, labelled it an inflammatory move. â€œSo much for Facebookâ€™s commitment to free speech,â€� a Mail Online spokesperson said. â€œWe are astonished by this inflammatory move, which is a blatant and clumsy attempt to try and intimidate the Australian government into watering down the provisions of the ACCC code. We trust Canberraâ€™s politicians stand firm and call Facebookâ€™s bluff by passing the legislation unchanged and enforce it to the letter of the law.â€� The managing director of the ABC, David Anderson, said ABC News was the number one digital news service and the nationâ€™s most trusted news outlet. He encouraged Australians to access the apps and website outside of Facebook. â€œDespite key issues such as the Covid pandemic having ongoing effects on all Australians, Facebook has today removed important and credible news and information sources from its Australian platform,â€� Anderson said. The publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, Nine Entertainment, said Facebookâ€™s â€œunfortunateâ€� decision benefitted no one. â€œFacebook will now be a platform for misinformation to rapidly spread without balance,â€� Nine said. â€œThis action proves again their monopoly position and unreasonable behaviour.â€�
The removal of news will have a devastating impact on smaller publishers and youth news companies, such as Junkee Media, which told a parliamentary inquiry that most of Junkeeâ€™s traffic â€“ 75% â€“ comes from Facebook and Google. Seven West, which declined to comment, also relies on Facebook for a lot of its traffic. Reset Australia, a global initiative working to counter digital threats to democracy, said Facebookâ€™s decision to pull news from its Australian users reveals just how little the platform cares about stopping misinformation. â€œFacebook blocking news in the middle of a pandemic, when accurate information is a key plank of the public health response, really tells you all you need know about how much Zuckerberg cares about Australian society and cohesion,â€� Resetâ€™s managing director, Chris Cooper, said. The director of the Australia Instituteâ€™s Centre for Responsible Technology, Peter Lewis, said the decision to prevent the sharing of public interest journalism would make it a weaker social network. â€œThe social network is destroying its social license to operate,â€� Lewis said. â€œFacebookâ€™s actions mean the companyâ€™s failures in privacy, disinformation and data protection will require a bigger push for stronger government regulation.â€� But former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said Thursdayâ€™s outcome â€œwas a very foreseeable possible consequenceâ€� of the governmentâ€™s strategy. Turnbull told the ABC the Coalition was â€œessentially holding a gun to the head of private businessesâ€�. â€œThe government will get fantastic publicity in the media in Australia because every media outlet in Australia has a conflict of interest,â€� he said. â€œBut Facebookâ€™s concern, as they have said quite openly, is they are worried about setting a precedent.â€�"
2021-02-18T05:50:22Z,technology,Technology,'Time to reactivate MySpace': the day Australia woke up to a Facebook news blackout,"At 5.30am Australian east coast time, after months of threats and failed attempts to lobby the government over proposed new media laws, Facebook banned the sharing of news in Australia. The first to notice were morning news producers. The main page of the national broadcaster, ABC, was down. Guardian Australiaâ€™s page was also down. Australians trying to post links to news publishers on their personal Facebook pages received an error message. Australiaâ€™s media bargaining code, which will force tech giants Facebook and Google to broker deals with Australian publishers to pay for linking to news content, passed its first major parliamentary hurdle this week. Google responded by negotiating a reported $30m deal with Australiaâ€™s largest locally owned media company. Facebook pulled the plug.
But Facebookâ€™s snap ban did not just affect Australiaâ€™s news publishers. On Twitter, which has so far escaped the reach of Australiaâ€™s proposed media code by dint of never making any money, the screenshots began to roll in. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which uses its Facebook page to deliver climate updates and severe weather warnings, was blocked. So too was the Western Australian Department of Fire and Emergency Services, which earlier this month was issuing evacuation warnings for a bushfire that destroyed 86 homes in the Perth hills. In a statement, DFES said it had contacted Facebook â€œand they have assured us they will restore the page as a priorityâ€�. State health departments, where daily coronavirus figures and information about potential exposure sites are listed, were deleted, as was the official page for the governments of the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and Tasmania.
So too was St Vincentâ€™s Health, a hospital in Melbourne that is soon to begin distributing the first coronavirus vaccines in Australia. On Twitter, the organisation said it was â€œextremely concerningâ€� to find its page had been blocked â€œduring a pandemic and on the eve of a crucial Covid vaccine distributionâ€�.
1800 Respect, a family violence service, was blocked, as were homelessness services, other crisis centres and womenâ€™s shelters. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander media pages servicing small, often remote communities were gone.
The leader of the opposition in Western Australia, Zak Kirkup, had his page blocked, three weeks out from the state election, but the premierâ€™s page remained intact. On Twitter, the only place left to be, Kirkup joked: â€œAlright time to reactivate my MySpace account.â€�
Facebook even blocked its own page.
The sudden national blackout of legitimate information sources appeared to some to expose the hollowness of Facebookâ€™s prior claims that it was unable to suppress hate speech or pages spreading dangerous misinformation, and its failure to respond to reports of abuse. With sufficient motivation, like the prospect of having to pay to link to news content, the social media giant was able to act swiftly, they said.
At 8am, the federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, tweeted that heâ€™d had a â€œconstructive discussion with Mark Zuckerbergâ€� about the media code, and said the two parties had agreed â€œto try to find a pathway forwardâ€�. The conversation went for half an hour. The pair also spoke on the weekend, but Frydenberg said he was not warned the ban was coming.
At 11am, Facebook released a non-apology, saying that government pages should not be impacted by its decision to ban news but also that the broad definition of news in the legislation was to blame. It did not explain why, despite having threatened this action for weeks, it didnâ€™t check that the filter was working as intended first. â€œAs the law does not provide clear guidance on the definition of news content, we have taken a broad definition in order to respect the law as drafted,â€� a Facebook spokesperson said. â€œHowever, we will reverse any pages that are inadvertently impacted.â€� This prompted an escalation of the governmentâ€™s language. â€œFacebook was wrong,â€� Frydenberg told reporters at a midday press conference.
â€œFacebookâ€™s actions were unnecessary, they were heavy-handed, and they will damage its reputation here in Australia,â€� he said. Frydenberg said the decision to block government pages was â€œcompletely unrelated to the media codeâ€�, which still has to be debated in the Senate before it becomes law. But he said the government was committed to the reforms, and said Facebookâ€™s actions â€œconfirm for all Australians [the] immense market power of these media digital giantsâ€�. It is not clear whether Facebook, which has 2.89bn monthly active users and a net worth of US$780bn, is concerned about any reputational damage that may arise from blocking potentially lifesaving information for 11.23 million Australians. Frydenbergâ€™s press conference was livestreamed on Facebook, but the feed stopped working several minutes in.
Meanwhile, the Australian communications minister, Paul Fletcher, was fielding calls from the admin of the Facebook group North Shore Mums, which was also caught up in the ban. It did not take Australians long to discover a workaround. News links via third-party aggregators still worked, as did links to tweets containing links to news articles. Links to news articles could also be shared in Facebook messenger, including via chatbots. By 1pm, the Bureau of Meteorology, 1800 Respect, and a number of other government and community pages were back online. News sites were not."
2021-02-18T01:49:31Z,technology,Technology,"Facebook's botched Australia news ban hits health departments, charities and its own pages","The Bureau of Meteorology, state health departments, the Western Australian opposition leader, charities and Facebook itself are among those to have been hit by Facebook’s ban on news in Australia. On Thursday morning Facebook began preventing Australian news sites from posting, while also stopping Australian users from sharing or viewing content from any news outlets, both Australian and international. The social media giant said it made the decision in response to the news media bargaining code currently before the Senate, which would force Facebook and Google to negotiate with news companies for payment for content.
While the ban was only meant to target Australian news publishers, dozens of pages run by key government agencies, community pages, union pages, charity organisations and politicians were also blocked for several hours. Australia’s main source of weather information, the Bureau of Meteorology, said on Thursday morning that it had been blocked, and was advising users to go to its direct website, app or Twitter page.
As Australia prepares to begin the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, state health departments, including SA Health and Queensland Health, were unable to post. St Vincent’s Health in Melbourne said it was “extremely concerning” its Facebook page had been blocked “during a pandemic and on the eve of crucial Covid vaccine distribution”. Health minister Greg Hunt said he was “profoundly shocked” that health organisations, including Bowel Cancer Australia and the Kids Cancer Project had been affected. “The fact that the kids cancer project could be affected, is, frankly a disgrace. Facebook should fix it and they should address that immediately,” Hunt told reporters. The shadow health minister, Mark Butler, said it was “completely irresponsible” behaviour by Facebook, and the pages needed to be restored. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic,” he tweeted. “Australians need to hear from credible voices in the vaccine rollout. This is completely irresponsible from Facebook. The Morrison government needs to fix this today.” The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the federal government needed to “sort it out.” “It needs to be fixed up and it needs to be fixed up today.” The Western Australian Department of Fire and Emergency Services’s page was also stripped of content. A number of Australian Capital Territory government pages were also caught up in Facebook’s action. By midday on Thursday, some pages had been restored including those run by BoM and the state health departments. Just weeks out from the Western Australian election, the state’s opposition leader, Zak Kirkup, also was blocked, while incumbent premier Mark McGowan’s page remained unaffected. 1800 Respect, Mission Australia, Hobart Women’s Shelter, National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services, Australian Wildlife Conservancy and a number of other charities were also blocked on Thursday.
Labor’s shadow assistant minister for communities and the prevention of family violence, Jenny McAllister, said the government “needs to explain why this has happened on their watch and what they are doing to get essential domestic violence services back up and running on Facebook.” Cricket Australia and the Australian Council of Trade Unions were also hit with the ban.
So too were satire news outlets such as Betoota Advocate, the Chaser, and ABC’s Mad As Hell. Facebook itself was also blocked in Australia.
A Facebook spokeswoman said the blocks on non-news organisations had been a mistake. “The actions we’re taking are focused on restricting publishers and people in Australia from sharing or viewing Australian and international news content,” she said. “As the law does not provide clear guidance on the definition of news content, we have taken a broad definition in order to respect the law as drafted. However, we will reverse any pages that are inadvertently impacted.” People outside of Australia, or those who are not logged into Facebook, are still able to view the content on these pages. The Facebook chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, spoke with the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, on Thursday morning in the wake of the wide-ranging ban of content from Facebook. Frydenberg described the discussion as “constructive”."
2021-02-17T13:43:02Z,technology,Technology,Syringes and a flaming heart: iPhone reveals more than 200 new emojis,"More than 200 new emojis will arrive on iPhones with the release of the next operating system update, including a vaccine-ready syringe, a flaming heart and a vast array of options for couples with different skin tones. The emojis will arrive as part of iOS 14.5, expected to hit iPhones within the next month. The changes, collated from beta versions by Jeremy Burge, the founder and â€œChief Emoji Officerâ€� of Emojipedia, are a mixture of all-new creations, modifications to existing emojis, and a few updates unique to Appleâ€™s platform. By number, the largest change is to how users can represent themselves as a couple. Until now, only People Holding Hands â€“ ğŸ‘« â€“ has come with skin tone options, such as ğŸ‘©ğŸ�»ğŸ¤�ğŸ‘¨ğŸ�½ğŸ‘©ğŸ�¿ğŸ¤�ğŸ‘©ğŸ�½ or ğŸ‘¨ğŸ�¿ğŸ¤�ğŸ‘¨ğŸ�½, added in 2019 alongside the ability to represent the couple as same-sex. Now, the same ability to mix and match skin tones, and represent a couple as more than just a pair of yellow faces, has come to the other loved-up emoji, including ğŸ‘¨â�¤ï¸�ğŸ‘¨ and ğŸ‘©â�¤ï¸�ğŸ’‹ğŸ‘¨, though sadly too late for Valentineâ€™s Day. Representation continues in another option, adding two gender options for the emoji previously described as â€œPerson: Beardâ€�. Now, iPhone users will be able to select a man or woman with a beard, with one skin tone option uncannily reminiscent of 2014 Eurovision winner Conchita Wurst.
For many, the most prominent change might be an Apple-only tweak to how the syringe emoji, ğŸ’‰, is displayed. The emoji, which is only defined as showing a â€œsyringeâ€�, has tended to feature two drops of blood since its earliest inception in Japanese mobile phones of the early 00s. Now, Apple has updated it to a more general purpose image, containing a clear liquid â€“ and one perfect for showing off that youâ€™ve just been vaccinated against Covid. In the smiley, yellow face section of the picker, users have three new options, named by Unicode, the consortium that controls emojis, â€œExhaling Faceâ€�, â€œFace With Spiral Eyesâ€� and â€œFace in Cloudsâ€�. Emoji updates are a surprisingly fraught political affair. Unicode, which spends most of its time handling arcane issues around text representation on computers, doesnâ€™t actually design the icons, instead issuing a simple description of what they depict. That has historically led to fragmentation over the specifics of the design, allowing platform holders to add their own quirks to distinguish themselves. Thatâ€™s why Apple was able to unilaterally redesign its syringe, for instance, but had to wait for approval from Unicode to introduce skin tone options in 2015."
2021-02-17T08:38:55Z,technology,Technology,NBN Co paid staff and executives $77m in bonuses in last six months of 2020,"The government-owned company responsible for building and operating the National Broadband Network paid its staff and executives $77m in bonuses between July and December last year, new documents reveal. New data released to the Senate in response to questions on notice from a Senate estimates committee reveal NBN Co paid $4.3m in bonuses to executives including the CEO, and paid employees $73.2m in bonuses between July and December 2020. The total figure included an unspecified amount of deferred bonuses from 2017-18. NBN Co previously paid out $3.2m in bonuses to executives, and $40.1m to staff, for the reporting period of 2017-18. That included unspecified deferred bonuses from 2015-16. A Guardian Australia analysis has previously found NBN Co executives are paid higher than almost any other government business or department head, with the chief executive, Stephen Rue, paid more than five times as much as the prime minister, Scott Morrison, at $3.1m. In a response to questions from Guardian Australia, an NBN Co spokesperson said the company “has maintained employees’ salaries for FY21 at the same level as FY20”. “There have been no increases in pay for NBN Co employees, other than remuneration increases that were directly linked to individual promotions,” the spokesperson said. “Short-term incentives are included for selected roles at NBN Co and are only awarded if certain targets are met at the end of the performance period and subject to board approval. These targets are set out in NBN’s annual report. “For FY20, the NBN Co remuneration committee awarded short-term incentive[s] … based on the recognition that the company exceeded the majority of its corporate targets.”
A spokesman for the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, said issues of executive remuneration were a matter for the board of NBN Co. Labor’s shadow minister for communications, Michelle Rowland, said the payments were “offensive”. “It is offensive that $77m in taxpayer-funded bonuses were paid out at a time when the cost of the NBN has blown out by a further $6bn, and during a nationwide recession,” she said. “Scott Morrison said the purchase of $20,000 in Cartier watches for Australia Post executives was appalling and disgraceful. Where does he stand on this?” It comes as the company has also refused, for the first time, to disclose key financial figures to the parliament about the peak funding for the project, the debt profile and other information the company had previously made publicly available in its corporate plan. These figures would need to take into account the extra $6.7bn in funding NBN Co had acquired in order to continue construction of the network and funding required to fix issues with the hybrid-fibre-coaxial cable network portion of the network, which recently had to be paused due to a supply issue as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. In responses to 15 different questions on notice from Labor, NBN Co cited commercial confidentiality for the reason this information could no longer be disclosed, due to the need to seek funding from debt markets, and argued releasing this information could cause commercial harm. “NBN Co recognises the need to carefully balance the requirement for high levels of transparency against any commercial harm that could arise from releasing certain information, such long-term forecasts, which are by their nature highly uncertain,” NBN said. “Taking all those considerations into account the company determined that it would not be commercially prudent to release some information that may have been provided in previous corporate plans and this approach was agreed with shareholder ministers.” Rowland said the responses were “nothing short of a disgrace”. “It would appear that whenever data of this kind does not pose an inconvenience to the government, it’s readily made available. However, the moment it threatens to reveal cost blowouts, it conveniently gets reclassified as commercial-in-confidence,” she said."
2021-02-16T21:51:01Z,technology,Technology,Clubhouse app: what is it and how do you get an invite to the exclusive audio app?,"What is the Clubhouse app and why is it suddenly everywhere? Part talkback radio, part conference call, part Houseparty, Clubhouse is a social networking app based on audio-chat. Users can listen in to conversations, interviews and discussions between interesting people on various topics – it is just like tuning in to a podcast but live and with an added layer of exclusivity. Clubhouse is invite only. You can’t just download it off the app store and create an account. Much like a real-life country or yacht club, you have to be invited to join by an existing member. Real world elitism, but make it virtual. When you join, you select topics of interest, like tech, books, business or health. The more information you give the app about your interests, the more conversation rooms and individuals the app will recommend you follow or join. The conversation room is just like a conference call, but with some people on the call talking, and most listening in. And, just like a phone call, once the conversation is over, the room is closed. Unlike Twitch – where live streamed videos stay on the platform for people to return to and watch – the live audio-chats had in conversation rooms disappear. (However, this doesn’t stop users from recording the live conversation. A YouTube user, for instance, live-streaming a conversation room launched by Elon Musk). How do I get a Clubhouse invite? To join, an existing Clubhouse user has to send an invite from their app giving you access to set up an account. If you are invited, you’ll see a link texted to your phone number, directing you to a sign-up page in the app. Clubhouse users can’t just send an invite to anyone who wants to join, however. Existing users only have two invites available at first. In a recent blog post, the creators have announced that their 2021 goal is to complete the app’s beta stage, so they can eventually “open up Clubhouse to the whole world”. What has Elon Musk got to do with it? Clubhouse has been around since March 2020, when it was launched by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Paul Davidson and Rohan Seth. In May 2020, it had just 1,500 users, and was worth $100m. But this week it burst onto into the mainstream when Elon Musk hosted an audio-chat on Clubhouse with Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev. The event maxed out the app conversation room limits and was live-streamed to YouTube. It helped propel Clubhouse to the top of the startup charts and sparked a scramble for invitations. As of 1 February 2021, Clubhouse has 2 million users. Clubhouse has announced forthcoming new features, like tipping, tickets or subscriptions, to directly pay creators on the app. Having raised new funding since its launch, Clubhouse is now valued at $1bn, and is considered a Unicorn startup like AirBnb, Uber and SpaceX. Reuters reports that demand for membership is now so hot that a market for them has grown on platforms like Reddit, eBay, and Craigslist. In China, invitations are being sold on Alibaba’s second-hand market place Idle Fish. Musk summed up the appeal of Clubhouse during his chat with Tenev, noting that “context switching is the mind killer”. The idea is that when users are logged into Clubhouse, with notifications disabled, they can focus on one topic at a time. Why was it so popular in China? The app’s value extends beyond its exclusivity. While censorship, suppression and government control is rife in China, Clubhouse managed to fly under the radar of China’s firewall for several months, unlike other social media networks Instagram and Facebook. It became very popular in recent weeks, attracting large numbers of Chinese users and giving them a rare chance to “binge free expression”, and engage in discussion on topics that are usually blocked on the mainland, including Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Quartz reported that “Chinese users, largely tech investors and professionals, are using the space to talk about topics that would otherwise be censored back home, such as democracy.” E-commerce sites in China were offering hopeful users of Clubhouse the chance to buy invites. On platforms like Xianyu and Taobao, invite codes were being sold for between 150 – 400 yuan ($23 – $61). As of Monday 8 February 2021, however, Clubhouse has been blocked inside China."
2021-02-16T06:00:44Z,technology,Technology,Debate rages as Facebook prepares to say whether Trump can return,"Facebook is expected to announce imminently whether it will allow Donald Trump to return to the platform after banning him more than a month ago. The decision will be the most consequential yet made by Facebook’s Oversight Board, a group of 20 members who range from humanitarian activists and religious experts to lawyers and a former prime minister. The board, which launched in late 2020, is meant to function as an independent arm of the social platform, making binding decisions on a selection of its thorniest content moderation issues. The debate over the former president’s account has garnered a record 9,000 comments in advance of the decision, which could be announced as early as this week. Trump was removed on 7 January following his encouragement of an insurrection of the US Capitol the day prior, but he had for years used his Facebook account to share misinformation and violent rhetoric with his millions of followers. Hundreds of civil rights advocates submitted comments in advance of the decision saying that reinstating Trump’s account would again allow those problems to flourish on the site. “The Board must acknowledge that Trump’s social media presence has made not just Facebook users but the entire world less safe,” wrote Change the Terms, a coalition of more than 60 human rights groups. “It must act in defense of the people we represent and not reverse Facebook’s decision on a process foul.”
Another prominent voice in favor of a permanent Trump ban is Facebook’s former security chief Alex Stamos, who signed a letter along with a number of other prominent voices urging against Trump’s return. “The eventual deplatforming of Trump’s accounts helped defuse a dangerous and antidemocratic situation,” said the letter sent by a group of researchers and lawyers including Stamos. “Trump’s actions justified the step of indefinitely deplatforming him.” Many groups have noted Facebook’s issues with extremism and misinformation do not begin and end with Trump. The platform must also improve its policies and how they are implemented, said the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 220 national organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union, Human Rights Watch, and the Southern Poverty Law Center. “Facebook’s suspension of Trump is a step in the right direction toward countering misuse of its platform,” the coalition said. “His account should be suspended permanently to stop the spread of his lies and to prevent any further incitement to violence.” In a letter, the coalition also called on Facebook to better enforce its policies on election integrity, voter interference, and hate speech, “and not pick and choose when it will enforce its standards” and more swiftly remove voter suppression content on the platform. Others have criticized the nature of the oversight board and those appointed to it. A group formed of scholars, advocates and activists, including those from Color of Change and the Anti-Defamation League, has formed to criticize the board, calling itself “the Real Facebook Oversight Board”. It said in a letter Facebook should make its own decisions rather than outsource them to the board. It also called for more robust legislation to rein in these issues. “Facebook cannot be trusted to do this and [neither] they – nor a board appointed by them – should be allowed to make decisions like these,” the advocacy group wrote. “Real oversight must be combined with other critically needed reforms: laws that change financial incentives for big tech, heavy regulation and a reckoning with the algorithms that are laying waste to democratic society.” Trump was banned permanently from Twitter, seemingly his preferred platform, in January. Twitter company has said that ban will be permanent – even if Trump runs for office again. Facebook did not respond to request for comment regarding when the Trump decision would be announced."
2021-02-16T01:01:15Z,technology,Technology,Google and Facebook: the landmark Australian law that will make them pay for news content,"The Australian parliament is poised to pass a landmark media law that would make Google and Facebook pay news publishers for displaying their content. The Australian law is separate to a deal Facebook made to pay mainstream UK news outlets millions of pounds a year to license their articles, but has a similar motivation. The legislation, which will be debated this week, is designed to support Australian public interest journalism and is backed by all the nation’s media companies, big and small. Why was it necessary? Regulation was needed to ensure journalism was properly funded after the digital behemoths took the lion’s share of advertising revenue away from traditional media: for every $100 of online advertising spend, $53 goes to Google, $28 to Facebook and $19 to everyone else.
The media companies have argued that Google makes money from news and analysis provided by them, and users would find the sites much less helpful if no news appeared on their feeds or in their search results. How did the legislation come about? The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission held an 18-month inquiry which found there was an imbalance in power between the platforms and the media companies that threatened the viability of the news businesses. What did the regulator propose as a solution? The ACCC proposed a bargaining code to ensure that news media businesses are fairly remunerated for the content they generate. The code gives them a framework to bargain and reach a binding agreement. If they can’t agree, an arbiter will implement the “final offer arbitration” model to determine the level of remuneration. Breaches of the code, including not bargaining in good faith, would be punishable by a fine of $10m or the equivalent of 10% of annual turnover in Australia. But media companies have been encouraged to make commercial deals with Facebook and Google outside the code, and several have been announced or are imminent. What was the government’s response? The Coalition government embraced the idea and won the support of the opposition and the minor parties, after some horse trading that resulted in the public broadcasters – the ABC and SBS – being included as eligible under the code. How did the digital platforms react? Not well. Facebook threatened to block Australians from sharing news and Google ran a public campaign against the media code arguing it was unfair and that it would “break search”. At a parliamentary inquiry last month Google Australia’s managing director, Mel Silva, threatened to remove search from Australia. But the government stood firm and continued to push the legislation through a committee and into parliament. Silva said the proposed news code was untenable and would set a “dangerous precedent” of paying for links. Has anything been going on behind the scenes? Yes, a lot. Desperate not to see this “dangerous precedent” become law in Australia and threaten its business model globally, Google softened its stance and launched its News Showcase product in early February. It immediately signed up several smaller publishers to the scheme, and say those mastheads had 1m views of their content in eight days. This week Google signed one of the big four media companies, Seven West Media, in a reported $30m-a-year deal. Seven has described the deal as “fair payment” for original journalism. How did the government react to News Showcase? The government has held talks with platform leaders and has welcomed any fresh ideas. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has suggested the government is open to a compromise in how the code could be applied to Google. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has also indicated the talks between the tech companies and the media companies have been going well and deals are “very close”. Frydenberg said on the eve of the bill being debated that Google and Facebook were in “very productive and constructive talks with the commercial players”.
It’s understood Google may be willing to pay media companies similar amounts via Showcase licensing deals to avoid setting the precedent of paying for content displayed in search. In that case, the treasurer would retain the ability to designate search as the service covered by the code in the future if Google was not seen to be negotiating fairly with media companies. The legislation will be debated in parliament this week. Has everyone agreed to sign up for News Showcase? No, there is a way to go yet for separate deals, but talks between the parties are advanced. Nine Entertainment (publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, and the owner of the Nine TV network), News Corp Australia, Australian Community Media and Guardian Australia are still in negotiations with Google. Facebook has been quiet of late but has reportedly been in “positive” talks with at least one media company over its licensed product Facebook News – a news section inside its main mobile app – which would be used to make commercial deals with media companies. It is curated by journalists and prioritises original stories. Will it all be over when the legislation is passed? No. Once passed into law, the treasurer will review the working of the code in 12 months to check that the revenue is being spent on Australian public interest journalism and is not just lining the pockets of shareholders. The intention of the government is to “level the playing field and to ensure a sustainable and viable Australian media landscape”. A review will ensure the tech and media companies are acting in good faith and the money is flowing into newsrooms."
2021-02-15T07:00:06Z,technology,Technology,Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro review: cut-price noise-cancelling earbuds,"The Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro by the longstanding charging brand Anker look to offer good sound, long battery life and noise-cancelling at almost half the price of Apple’s AirPods Pro – and largely achieves the goal. The new true wireless earbuds cost £130, undercutting big-name competitors from Apple, Samsung, Sony, Jabra and Bose, with a design that doesn’t reinvent the wheel: a stalk, fairly small earbud and a silicone tip.
They are attractive and in blue they don’t look like an AirPod rip-offs. They weigh 5.2g each, are splash resistant and have a light but secure fit that is comfortable for extended listening periods, avoiding putting any undue pressure on the soft parts of your ear. They clip magnetically into a solid-feeling case with a slide-up lid. It is about twice the size of the best cases for rivals, making it still pocketable but not quite as easily carried about. Specifications Water resistance: IPX4 (splash resistant) Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.0, SBC, AAC Battery life: six hours ANC on (up to 21 hours with case; 26 hours with ANC off) Earbud dimensions: 37.3 x 22.1 x 23.1mm Earbud weight: 5.2g each Driver size: 11mm Charging case dimensions: 62.0 x 59.7 x 30.0mm Charging case weight: 50.5g Case charging: USB-C, Qi wireless charging Controls and connectivity
The Air 2 Pro are standard Bluetooth 5 earbuds and support the universal SBC and AAC audio standards used by most devices. Each earbud can be used on its own but they do not support seamless switching, meaning you have to manually disconnect them from one device to connect to another. Pairing is also manual but you only have to do it once per device. Open the case, press and hold the button to put them into pairing mode and find them in the Bluetooth settings of your smartphone the old-fashioned way. The connection was solid to an iPhone 12 Pro and Galaxy S21 Ultra but I could not test them in a congested area because of the Covid-19 restrictions in the UK. The earbuds have tap controls with double tap and tap-and-hold options for either pause/play, track skip, triggering your phone’s voice assistant, adjusting the volume or changing the noise-cancelling mode. They work fairly well but with only two tap variations, the controls are limited compared with competitors with three options, swipes or buttons. They automatically pause the music when one earbud is removed and start again once it is reinserted. The Soundcore app for Android or iPhone takes care of updates, settings, sound and noise-cancelling modes. Call quality was reasonable, with callers saying that I sounded a bit far away with some echo but still clear. The earbuds let some more background noise though compared with the best competitors. The earbuds last about six hours of playback with noise-cancelling turned on between charges. The case can fully charge them 2.5 times for a total playback time of 21 hours.
Sustainability Anker estimates that the batteries in the earbuds and case last for at least 500 cycles while maintaining at least 80% of their original capacity, but they are not replaceable, ultimately making the earbuds disposable.
The earbuds are repairable through Anker’s customer service or authorised repair centre. The company regularly operates trade-in schemes and recycles devices but does not publish impact assessments or sustainability reports. Sound and noise-cancelling
The Air 2 Pro sound surprisingly good for the money and features. They produce an easy-listening, full sound with plenty of deep bass. You have to like bass-heavy sound but the low end is fairly well controlled, with the warm mids and highs still coming through clearly. Those looking for more balanced sound best look elsewhere. They sound pretty good with most music genres but excel with dance and electronica, full of energy and deep bass. There is a full equaliser accessible in the Soundcore app, as well as a set of sound pre-sets, including the default “signature” sound and the classic “bass boost” if you really need more bass. In addition to good sound, the earbuds have effective noise-cancelling. The earbuds have different profiles for transport, indoors and outdoors, which each target different frequencies of noise, such as low rumbles or speech. There’s also a custom mode with a slider that adjusts the noise-cancelling but there are no markings on it to help you understand what is being targeted by each position on the slider, making it a bit of a trial and error process. Still, the noise-cancelling works better than I expected it to. They match the effectiveness of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro but fall short of the best, such as Jabra’s Elite 85t and the AirPods Pro, which is still impressive for the price. There are two ambient awareness modes, one for full transparency and one targeted at only allowing voices through. The full transparency mode is reasonable but a bit quiet and less natural sounding compared with the best. The vocal mode is very good, allowing me to have a full conversation with other people while still maintaining some noise-cancelling. Note that the sound is affected by having the noise-cancelling active, sounding a little more controlled and punchy but with slightly shallower bass. I preferred the sound with it active. Observations The HearID feature in the Soundcore app creates a personalised sound profile after conducting a short hearing test. The Soundcore app for Android and iOS has a widget for quickly switching between noise-cancelling and transparency modes. Price The Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro cost £129.99 and come in black, white, blue or pink. For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro have an RRP of £219, Galaxy Buds Live have an RRP of £179, the Jabra Elite 85t cost £219.99, the Bose QC Earbuds cost £249.95, the Sony WF-1000XM3 cost £169 and the Apple AirPods Pro cost £249. Verdict The Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro offer much of what makes some of the best true wireless earbuds great but at a marked-down price. Costing just over half the price of Apple’s AirPods Pro, the Air 2 Pro are comfortable, have a good battery life and connectivity, look good and work well. They also sound far better than you would expect for the money and have surprisingly effective noise-cancelling. The case is slightly bigger than the best, the sound is bass-heavy and the tap controls are a bit limited. They also lack seamless switching and other more advanced features, which are common to top-dollar earbuds, most of which can be overlooked at £130 or less. The battery cannot be replaced in the earbuds or case, however, ultimately making them disposable and losing a star. Pros: solid noise-cancelling, good sound, good value, solid battery, comfortable fit, lots of tips included, good app, Bluetooth 5, either bud can be used independently, AAC support. Cons: tap controls a bit limited, no seamless switching, case a little bigger than ideal, can’t connect to two devices at once, no higher quality audio standards, only splash resistant, disposable.

2021-02-15T01:30:01Z,technology,Technology,Bill Gates: ‘Carbon neutrality in a decade is a fairytale. Why peddle fantasies?’,"Bill Gates appears via video conference – Microsoft Teams, not Zoom, obviously – from his office in Seattle, a large space with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Lake Washington. It’s a gloomy day outside and Gates is, somewhat eccentrically, positioned a long way from the camera, behind a large, kidney-shaped desk; his communications manager sits off to one side. If one had to stage, for the purposes of symbolism, a tableau of a man for whom a distance of 3,000 miles between callers still constitutes too intimate a setting, it might be this. “As a way to start,” says Gates’ aide, “would it be helpful for Bill to make a couple of comments about why he wrote his new book?” It is helpful, and I’m not ungrateful, but this is not how interviews typically commence. There is an urge towards deference, when speaking to Gates, which attends few other people of commensurate fame. Celebrity is one thing, but wealth – true, former-richest-man-in-the-world wealth – is something else entirely; one has a sense of being granted an audience with the Great Man, a fact made more surreal by his famously muted persona. The 65-year-old has the lofty, mildly longsuffering air of a man accustomed to being the smartest guy in the room, leavened by wry amusement and interrupted, on the evidence of past interviews, by the occasional peevish outburst – most memorably in 2014, when Jeremy Paxman questioned him about Microsoft’s alleged tax avoidance. (“I think that’s about as incorrect a characterisation of anything I’ve ever heard,” he said, practically squirming in his seat with annoyance.)
Unlike the Elon Musks or Larry Ellisons of this world, however, Gates is perceived to be sensible, uxorious, modest, vowing not to ruin his children with boundless inheritance or to waste energy trying to send things to Mars. In the late 1990s, the US government brought an antitrust suit against Microsoft, accusing it of maintaining a monopoly in the PC market; a final settlement in 2001 overturned an earlier order for the company to be broken up. Since then, Gates has enjoyed a reputation as the Good Billionaire, dispensing a fortune through his foundation and overshadowing what his detractors would say is his biggest shortcoming: his unquestioning belief in progress as a function of capitalist growth. All of these aspects come together in Gates’ new book, How To Avoid A Climate Disaster, which, as he tells me, grew out of two things: his interest in the sciences and what struck him as an irresistible challenge – the fiendishly difficult problem of how to further global development while reducing emissions. For the past few decades, much of Gates’ focus has been on expanding access to electricity in the remotest parts of the world. “And yet,” he says, “the idea of adding new electricity capacity – you can’t just go build coal plants. And understanding how expensive it needs to be, and how this is going to work, had me doing a lot of reading.” There’s another, greater obstacle to reaching zero emissions, which is the political challenge – part of which involves climate activists limiting their exposure to accusations of hypocrisy. Gates loves private jets; he calls them his “guilty pleasure”. He loves hamburgers and eating grapes year-round. A few weeks after we speak, it is reported that he is involved in a bid to buy Signature Aviation, which handles ground services for 1.6m private jet flights a year. Today he says, “I get sustainable aviation fuel that I use when I fly,” and mentions another, vaguely futuristic-sounding service: “I’ve paid to offset my carbon footprint – there’s this group Climeworks that does direct air capture up in Iceland.” On the subject of imported food, he says: “Well, growing food locally is often worse, because you’re putting things in greenhouses that have an insane climate imprint. I’m not the only one who eats out-of-season food, as far as I know. But if that’s people’s main objection and they’ll adopt my plan, then” – Gates smiles, in a rather glittering way – “I’ll cede my grape-eating.” For Gates, this focus on grapes and private jet travel is, relatively speaking, like rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic. “What months of the year do I have to stop eating hamburgers?” he says sardonically. “I don’t need the tomato. Or the lettuce. Just the bun and the meat will do.” There is no suggestion that using “direct air capture” to offset one’s flights, were such a service even affordable for regular people, would make the slightest dent in the problem. But by using a private jet, Gates makes it easier for others to undermine him. It’s not, one imagines, the strongest tool in his skill set, to play dumb in order to win lesser mortals over.
Instead, what he does is bombard us with data and expertise. His book encompasses wisdom from sources that range from less well-known climate scientists, such as Vaclav Smil and Ken Caldeira, to John D Cox, author of Weather For Dummies, which, says Gates, remains one of the greatest books about weather ever written. Yet Gates’ book is compulsively readable. His ambition was to “cut through the noise” and give consumers better tools for understanding what works, an ambition he meets admirably. It’s more than that, however. Gates can get an audience with anyone, can marshal almost limitless resources, and is dogged in the detail. The result – particularly in the wake of the Trump presidency – is thrilling. It is also, occasionally, comic. “I can’t deny being a rich guy with an opinion,” he writes, with a nod to the flip-side of his visionary status, that of the despised billionaire flogging a hobby-horse. And there is a nerdy bathos to some of his passions. In one episode, Gates takes his 15-year-old son, Rory, round a power plant on a family holiday, something he bills as a jolly day out. “I’m in awe of physical infrastructure,” he explains. The depressing part of the book is its account of the challenge ahead, which Gates presents as extremely urgent – and, in order to avoid defeatism, also just about doable. He points to a headline figure: 51bn. This is the amount of greenhouses gas, in tons, emitted globally each year, which we have to get down to net zero by 2050. The first step towards this is understanding what we’re dealing with. “Let’s have more literate climate articles, so people can understand if it’s a breakthrough that’s a big deal or a small deal.” For example, the transport industry, on which so much attention is focused, accounts for only 16% of global emissions – which is why, as air travel has ground to a halt, greenhouse gases have gone down by only around 5%. As Gates points out, the future of car travel lies in electric vehicles; but if the electricity comes from coal-fired power plants, the switch is of limited value. Cars are a minor part of the problem compared with the juggernaut of emissions generated by the global cement and steel industries.
“Most people don’t understand what cement is,” says Gates, igniting with interest. “And I spent literally weeks understanding why it’s so miraculous, and could we use less of it?” The same goes for meat production. “To understand, OK, what is the ratio of the input of the calories of the cow to the output? What are cow genetics?” Cow burps and farts account for around 4% of global emissions; without striking beef from our diets, how can those emissions be offset or eliminated? Like a lot of people, I’ve indulged in somewhat magical thinking around this, dutifully recycling my plastic every week while assuming that, when push comes to shove, the US government will devote the entire annual defence budget to climate control and invent a shield or something. And Gates covers some cool, sci-fi type innovations, most of them to do with those direct air capture technologies, which suck (not the scientific term) greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere. There is a solar-powered dehumidifier to get drinking water out of air, and a technology for storing heat in “molten salt”. There is geoengineering, which may one day be capable of reducing the amount of sunlight hitting the world’s surface by “distributing extremely fine particles” into the upper atmosphere or using a salt spray to “brighten clouds”. But these innovations are cripplingly expensive and imprecise. If you meddle with clouds over the US, there is no guarantee the temperature in China won’t go down. The biggest gesture most powerful authorities are willing to make involves divesting from polluting industries. Last year, New York state pledged to divest its $226bn (£165bn) pension fund from fossil fuel companies. This strikes Gates as wholly inadequate; it diverts the focus from more urgent concerns, such as finding a carbon neutral energy source to power the electricity grid. “It’d be tragic to have this whole generation behind the cause, and then you just do the easy stuff like divesting securities. You can say, ‘OK, I don’t want any more of those evil oil company stocks. Yay!’ Well, how many tons [of carbon] did you avoid by doing that?”
The same goes for everybody vowing to eat less meat. “I mean, these are good things – in fact, buying Beyond Burgers [a plant-based “meat” company that Gates invests in] actually drives demand, which will get the quality up and the rate premium down, so consumer behaviour is important. But unless you replace steel, it’s a joke. Just forcing companies to report their CO2 is a good thing; but when you open that steel company report, you’re going to go, ‘Oh, this is shocking, they have emissions!’ And what? Are we not going to build buildings in India to provide people with basic shelter? “If this was all about a 20% reduction, it should be pretty easy. Rich countries could reduce our cars and big houses, and the ridiculous amounts of meat we eat by 20%. The thing that makes climate so hard is that it’s not about a 20% reduction – it’s about getting it to zero. So things like [changing] mass transit so you have 20% less miles driven in the city, that doesn’t go anywhere.” The only thing that would neutralise the climate impact of public transport is if every vehicle were powered by a zero-emission fuel. One solution Gates cites is clean hydrogen. It doesn’t yet exist in a widespread usable form, but were the technology to advance to create “super, super cheap and totally clean hydrogen, that helps a lot of industrial processes. You could use that to make fertiliser in a clean way, to help make steel in a clean way. That alone would help with about 30% of emissions, which is pretty amazing – to have one thing that can do 30%.” *** If there is a credibility gap in listening to Gates on this subject, it comes from the suspicion that he lives in a world so far removed from the rest of us as to raise large blind spots. It’s a small thing, but in a 2014 Rolling Stone interview, Gates mentioned a lunch with Charles Koch, the libertarian billionaire who made huge sums from the oil business and for decades lobbied to reduce US environmental regulations. “He’s a very nice person,” Gates said in that interview, “and he has this incredible business track record.” Koch, along with his late brother David, spent decades funding climate deniers. Gates’ regard for him seems vested entirely in his success as a businessman; no matter how philanthropic, at some level the billionaire class is loyal primarily to itself. But there is no denying that Gates is alert to inequity. “It’s the rich countries that did all the emissions,” he says, “but it’s these poor countries [that will suffer]. The injustice of this on a global basis is pretty mind-blowing.” Still, he is often at odds with other climate campaigners, particularly those on the left. Of the Green New Deal, the proposal backed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that raises the goal of carbon neutrality in a decade, he is flatly dismissive. “Well, it’s a fairytale. It’s like saying vaccines don’t work – that’s a form of science denialism. Why peddle fantasies to people?” This seems a little harsh, and one suspects that Gates’ vehemence is powered by a broader disapproval of Ocasio-Cortez’s politics. But his point is that there isn’t the time, money or political will to reconfigure the energy industry in a decade; by encouraging an impossible goal, you doom yourself to short-termist measures that prove insufficient.
How helpful does he consider protest movements like Extinction Rebellion, with their habit of shutting down busy thoroughfares at rush hour? “Well, what we need is innovation. So if they’re really strategic about what street they cut off, and some poor guy is blocked in traffic and he sits there and says: ‘God, I’ve got to figure out a way to make steel [carbon neutral]. I was being lazy, but now that I’m sitting here in traffic, I’m going to go home tonight and figure how to do this.’ Then it’s a very direct connection between blocking the traffic and solving climate change.” He smiles sarcastically. “I don’t mean to make fun of it – in a way their passion is valuable. But it’s going to manifest in some ways that aren’t that constructive. So we need to channel that energy in a way that takes 51bn and moves it towards zero.” And Greta Thunberg? “To some degree the resonance of the issue – if climate change wasn’t important, she wouldn’t be on the front page.” I quite like Gates for this. One can imagine him having a pop at Malala Yousafzai, too; popular sentimentality is not something that interests him. “I’m not trying to take anything away from her. And every movement needs iconic leaders who speak, and that’s a pretty good thing. But there’s probably some teenager who believes that the Rohingya should be treated better, and another who thinks we’re not investing enough in good education. So the world has sought her out to speak in this clear, almost innocent way about a cause that we’re trying to orchestrate our energy around, and say hey, can we maintain this and convince people to make sacrifices? And how big do these sacrifices need to be? So I’m glad: you can’t have a movement without high-visibility figures. I hope she’s not messing up her education. She seems very clever.” Well, hang on, I say: you’re a college drop-out yourself. “That’s true. Teaching yourself stuff works very well for some people, and probably for her.” *** Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard in 1975, to form Microsoft. For the next 20 years, he focused solely on building the company; by 1996, it had a market cap of $100bn. Gates, meanwhile, became the world’s richest man in 1995, a spot he held intermittently until he was bumped by Jeff Bezos in 2018. It’s tempting to read the Gates aesthetic – plain, functional, allergic to anything not in service to his goals – as the key to his success, and at least as important as his coding genius. These days, according to Forbes, his personal fortune is around $120bn (£88bn). But it wasn’t until he turned 40, he says, that he started to think about philanthropy, even though it was always there in his upbringing. His father, Bill Gates Sr, was a lawyer who became instrumental in the setting up of the Gates Foundation. His mother, Mary, who worked on various charitable boards, gave a toast at Gates’ wedding to Melinda, saying, “From those to whom much is given, much is expected.” So yes, says, Gates, “The idea that the success of Microsoft is so much money for one individual – that giving that back to society in some constructive way might be something I might end up doing – slowly but surely dawned on me.” He was mentored in this by his friend Warren Buffett. Gates is still annoyed by something CNN founder Ted Turner said of both men, years ago, “claiming that we wanted to be higher on some wealth list. And honestly we weren’t hyper-focused on it.” The subject of pandemics is one that has obsessed him for two decades, going back to the foundation’s initial $750m donation to the Gavi Vaccine Alliance in 1999 and culminating in 2014 when he gave a Ted talk on the international community’s failure to prepare for the next big outbreak. Gates has donated $100m to Covid research, and on CNN before Christmas, predicted that “the next four to six months could be the worst of the epidemic”. Will he wait his turn for the vaccine, like everyone else? “That’s right. I’m a healthy 65-year-old, and I’ll delegate it to the states. So probably in March or April, they will film me taking the vaccine.”
That he is filmed is important. Gates has become the focus for online conspiracy theories about how he “created” the virus, and is now using the vaccine to implant microchips. For months, he has been batting away these theories; in an interview with Reuters in January, he repeated with weary finality how “crazy” and “evil” it all was. Does he think the vaccine roll-out in the US, which has been fairly chaotic, could have been better handled? “It’s incredibly complex, especially when trying to do so at the scale and speed required. For context, India’s campaign to give 400 million children the measles rubella vaccine took over two years with a full year of planning. National leadership is crucial: I am hopeful the incoming administration can help give that.” Meanwhile, Gates points out that the experience of the pandemic bears “strong connections” to what will happen if we don’t address the climate emergency. “We rely on government to look out for the future, so that even if something unlikely shows up, people aren’t dying and the economy isn’t wrecked. And so for the pandemic, despite many people, including myself, saying that we ought to get prepared – literally the title of my Ted talk was ‘We’re not ready’ – the government let us down. And so with climate change: we want government to look ahead and do the right things.” It is a much more complicated landscape, in which the single most useful thing individuals can do, in Gates’ view, is to educate themselves, the better to judge the impact of various solutions. “There’s no simple thing like get a vaccine and the nightmare ends. You’re talking about replacing every steel and cement factory, everything you do with electricity and transportation, even food. It’s way broader, and the time to do these large-scale things is way longer.” One of the more mind-blowing facts Gates shares in his book is that during the ice age the global temperature was a mere six degrees cooler than it is today; and when the dinosaurs were around, only four degrees hotter. So, as climate deniers love to say, what’s the big deal if things warm up a bit?
“That was confusing me a little bit,” Gates says. “We have these huge ranges of temperature, there have been forests at the south pole, so hey, how bad can this be? But understand that it’s the rate of change; that the speed with which the CO2 is going up is so fast, that evolution can’t help. If this was happening over tens of millions of years, instead of 100 years, then the Earth could adjust.” He pauses to consider another terrifying detail. “The fact there is so much water in the Antarctic ice, and that it can raise the sea level by over 100ft – that is mind-blowing, too.” If he were 30 years younger, would he consider not having kids? “Rich countries are worried about shrinking. So no, I wouldn’t say to somebody, please don’t have kids. We will make the world a reasonable place to live in and so kids will be fine.” He thinks for a moment. “It is weird that in 2050, I’ll be 95 years old. Will I live to see this play out, in terms of what works and what doesn’t work? This is why you have to engage the young.” Gates’ method of engaging his children is in line with his own interests, which his son, Rory, now 21, passionately shares. (His daughters, Phoebe and Jennifer, are 18 and 24 respectively, and seem to have been spared the holiday day trips.) “The history of steel goes back some 4,000 years,” says Gates dreamily, and mentions again how much he loves concrete. Did Rory never complain about being dragged off to look at a factory? “He has a deep amount of curiosity,” says Gates. “There were a few – like going to the sewage plant – that were fairly smelly. Going to where they process garbage, and the factory where they make toilet paper and paper towels, that also had a bad smell. Although for both of us that was pretty interesting.” Gates considers himself “naive about the physical world”, and is fascinated by how things work. “We’re both a bit like that. So it was like: how are things really made? This guy Smil [energy academic Vaclav Smil] writes all these books about this, such fascinating books, but they never sell. People just take the fact that you flip the switch and the light goes on for granted, and behind that are such unbelievable innovations. Likewise the creation of steel and how cheap all that stuff is. Seeing it directly, I highly recommend that. I want to see tours of steel plants go up dramatically.” There is an assumption, I suggest, that anyone in Gates’ wealth category has a personal contingency plan: a secret rocket ship, say, or a fortified island, or at the very least, an extremely well-stocked bunker. “No, I don’t. In my lifetime, the weather will be worse, but it’s mostly at the equator. I’m not a survivalist.” Instead his version of survivalism is to fund innovation. “I’m putting money into carbon capture and nuclear fission. The [Gates] foundation does what we call adaptation work, which is improving seeds.” (This is so crops can survive drought and floods in the zones most affected by the climate crisis.) He is also investing in the development of batteries that could, for example, power Tokyo for three days if a cyclone knocked out the power. (It would cost $400bn.) Is there any single area of innovation that, if we got it right, might save us? “The basic answer is no,” says Gates. The scale of the threat is so all-encompassing, so demanding of radical changes to transport, buildings, industry, land use and political will, that “there is no single breakthrough that can solve all those things”. There are, he says, “a couple that are very high on the list”. If there is something talismanic about Gates, and the faith we have in our billionaires and geniuses to magic us out of this hole, he isn’t here to encourage it. “But if you only get the top ones on the list,” he says, with a kind of terrifying calmness, “you’re in deep, deep, deep trouble.” • Bill Gates’ How To Avoid A Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have And The Breakthroughs We Need is published by Allen Lane on 16 February at £20.

2021-02-14T10:10:38Z,technology,Technology,Airbnb owners caught ignoring travel ban to let out holiday homes,"Accommodation booking sites are being urged to clamp down on holiday-home owners after an Observer investigation found that half of Airbnb owners were willing to host guests for trips this month, including over half-term. Despite a national lockdown with “stay at home” messages and strict government guidelines allowing people to only book accommodation under exceptional circumstances – such as moving house, for work or fleeing domestic abuse – our research found that 50% of Airbnb hosts we messaged to book a trip outside of these reasons, in locations such as London, Margate, Birmingham and Whitstable, were happy to proceed with the booking. When asked if it was possible to stay bringing a child over half-term, one Airbnb owner in Birmingham responded: “Yes, you’re very welcome. Three minutes walk away is a lovely boating lake/reservoir. Lots of ducks and wildlife.” Another replied: “Yes, you can stay with your son ... Looking forward to being your host.” When booking, Airbnb asks guests to tick a box confirming they are staying for a valid reason, but our research and reviews on the platform show that guests are flouting these rules and property owners are continuing to host holidaymakers even when they know it is illegal to do so. Other travel accommodation sites such as Booking.com were also found to be allowing people to book trips on their platforms. While some accommodation owners on Booking.com clearly state that you will need to bring evidence to support your stay, others did not stipulate extra measures and it appeared that a holidaymaker could book a trip without any stringent checks in place.
Karen Buck, the Labour MP for Westminster North, who has spoken out about Airbnb previously, said: “Short-let accommodation platforms need to take their responsibilities very seriously, and make clear to hosts that they will not be permitted to flout the rules. “It simply can’t be left to hard-pressed local councils or national government to monitor and enforce, while both platforms and hosts benefit from the income. This appears to demonstrate why the ‘sharing economy’ shouldn’t escape regulation entirely.” One Airbnb host in Margate, who asked not to be named, told the Observer: “‘We were asked if it was possible for a group of four friends to come to our Airbnb, which of course legally and morally we had to decline,” she said. “While we are aware people are desperate for some respite, it is a national lockdown. It’s very frustrating that some think the rules don’t apply to them.” A spokesperson for Airbnb said: “We take these reports very seriously and are investigating the cases that have been brought to our attention. With lockdowns in place across the UK, stays on Airbnb are only available in limited circumstances, in line with government guidance. The vast majority of hosts follow the rules and our website restricts bookings to guests with legal exemptions.” A spokesperson for Booking.com said: “During this rapidly evolving time, Booking.com is committed to featuring information across its site reiterating to customers that there are currently travel restrictions to consider in many destinations. We have also set up tools to make it easier for accommodations to provide clear information to guests about what national and local measures mean, and to indicate any conditions that may apply, including requiring proof of essential travel where relevant.”"
2021-02-13T19:00:22Z,technology,Technology,Facebook v Apple: the looming showdown over data tracking and privacy,"Facebook is taking lessons from its debacle over WhatsApp privacy changes in a bid to prevent millions of its users opting out of allowing the company to track their interests across the internet. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, was forced to delay an update to its privacy policy last month when an in-app notification informed users that some data from the communications app would be shared with Facebook. It raised concerns about the privacy of chat messages and profile data, and led users to shift in droves to other encrypted messaging apps such as Signal. Now a looming showdown with Apple over data tracking has prompted Facebook onto the front foot. What will users see? Some time in the next few months, iPhone users will be greeted by a message – not from Facebook, but from Apple – asking them if they will allow the Facebook app to collect their data. If users refuse, Apple will prevent Facebook from doing so.
A similar message from Apple will pop up, related to any app that collects data on users for advertising purposes. Facebook says it will preempt the change by rolling out a pop-up screen over the coming weeks and months, making a plea to users to stay opted in. “Agreeing to these prompts doesn’t result in Facebook collecting new types of data; it just means that Facebook can continue to give people better experiences,” a Facebook spokeswoman said. What sort of data are we talking about? It’s almost a given that when you shop online for shoes, you’ll suddenly find yourself served with ads for shoes across a bunch of other websites, or in your Facebook feed. If you’ve been in a physical store, you might see a related ad pop up in one of your apps later on. The ability of websites to track you across the internet might creep you out, but companies know exactly where to pitch their advertising through data collected about everything from places you’ve visited to health information. What is Apple doing? Apple has been slowly pushing back on how much data apps can collect by giving users the option to turn off location tracking, and letting people know if an app is tracking their location while running in the background.
“Right now, users may not know whether the apps they use to pass the time, to check in with their friends, or to find a place to eat, may in fact be passing on information about the photos they’ve taken, the people in their contact list, or location data that reflects where they eat, sleep or pray,” Apple CEO, Tim Cook, said late last month at the Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference. Late last year, it forced app providers in iOS to spell out what data they collect through “nutrition labels” in the App Store. The label showing exactly how much Facebook Messenger collects, along with Facebook’s announcement that it was planning to use data from WhatsApp to advertise products to users, led to the exodus of users to encrypted apps such as Signal. The next step for Apple is to allow users to opt out of data collection entirely. In an update to iOS14 to be rolled out in the next few months, Apple will allow users to control what data each app collects and switch it on and off at will. What is Facebook’s response? The move has been broadly welcomed by privacy groups, but Facebook sees Apple’s new privacy controls as a direct assault on its business.
Rather than arguing it needs to collect all this data on its users, Facebook has framed its objections as preventing small businesses from pinpointing where to place their ads. Facebook has also argued Apple telling its users what types of data are collected by each app does not provide the context for how it is used. “Apple’s new prompt is designed to present a false trade-off between personalised ads and privacy; when in fact we can provide both,” a Facebook spokeswoman said. “Apple is doing this to self-preference their own services and targeted advertising products.” Where is this privacy fight heading? Apple is unlikely to back down, with Cook hinting that data collection by companies such as Facebook can be blamed for much of the rampant disinformation and conspiracy theories online. “We can no longer turn a blind eye to a theory of technology that says all engagement is good engagement – the longer the better – and all with the goal of collecting as much data as possible,” he said. “Too many are still asking the question, ‘how much can we get away with?’ when they need to be asking, ‘what are the consequences?’ “A social dilemma cannot be allowed to become a social catastrophe.” Cook said advertising had existedfor decades before technology began collecting vast amounts of data across websites and apps. In a results call the day before Cook’s speech, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg accused Apple of making the decision on the basis of competitive interests, rather than privacy.
“We’re also seeing Apple’s business depend more and more on gaining share in apps and services against us and other developers,” he said. “Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own. “When you hear people argue that we shouldn’t be doing these things – or that we should go back to the old days of untargeted television ads – I think that what they are really arguing for is a regression where only the largest companies have this capacity, small businesses are severely disadvantaged, and competition is diminished.” Where does Google stand on this? Google has been much less aggressive about the changes, with the company’s most recent blog post stating it was working to comply with the changes for its apps, and advising customers they could see “a significant impact to their Google ad revenue on iOS” after the change. But Apple may be gunning for Google’s business, too. The search bar in iOS14 quietly replaced Google’s search results with its own, but it’s a long step from Apple launching its own search engine, and given the debacle when Apple first tried to replace Google Maps on 2012, it is likely to take it slowly."
2021-02-12T15:08:23Z,technology,Technology,'No skinny jeans': Gen Z launch TikTok attack on millennial fashion,"A generation war has been playing out on TikTok for some time, though anyone older than 24 might be oblivious to the millions of “millennial v Gen Z” videos that have appeared on the social media site in the past year. But now the kids have turned their sights on something that millennials apparently hold close to their hearts: skinny jeans. In scenes reminiscent of the “OK boomer” meme that divided the generations in 2019, the videos have shone a light on how Generation Z – broadly defined as anyone born between the mid-90s and 2010 – identify themselves in contrast with the generation that came before them. Since January there have been 274,000 videos tagged “no skinny jeans” on TikTok and 8.3m millennial v Gen Z videos. Earlier in the month the male supermodel Luka Sabbat told Esquire: “Skinny jeans don’t look as flattering nowadays.” A video from TikTok user @momohkd instructs her 410,000 viewers to throw their skinny jeans away, set them alight or cut them into something new. Like other users she says millennials should stop wearing them to look younger.
Skinny jeans became mainstream in 2005 after featuring in the Dior Homme autumn/winter collection, as overseen by Hedi Slimane. The size of the jeans – 27 inches – were considered tiny, especially in contrast to the price tag: about £200. “Slimane’s skinny jeans were significant for their cut, but also for the bodies he showed them on – incredibly skinny bodies, both of male and female models,” says Emma McClendon, the author of Denim: Fashion’s Frontier. “This changed the marketing and styling of jeans advertisements away from the more sensual look that had dominated the market for bootcut, low-rise jeans to a more androgynous and impossibly thin figure.”
The skinny jean became part of the 2000s boho look of It-girls such as Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and Nicole Richie (as styled by Rachel Zoe), as well as a part of the alternative rock boom of the era, as seen on bands including the Strokes and Razorlight. But they never really went away: Jill Biden recently wore a pair on Instagram and they also became a distinguishing feature on the “four lads in jeans” meme.
But there has been an increased focus on body inclusivity in fashion in recent years. In September Versace cast three plus-size models for the first time, and the plus-size model Paloma Elsesser was on the cover of US Vogue in January. This chimes with Generation Z’s social activism and calls for greater diversity. On TikTok, Gen Z users have advocated for baggy jeans instead of slim-fit – eschewing the prescribed idea that thinness is attainable. According to market research company Edited, sales of men’s relaxed-fit jeans have increased by 15% and women’s wide-legged jeans are up 97%. The skinny v baggy online debate not only exposes a generational divide but other socioeconomic truths, too. “This is about issues of ‘taste’ but they intersect with issues of class, age, location, gender,” says McClendon. The skinny jean, however, may prove hard to get rid of. Last month, the Levi’s chief executive, Chip Bergh, told investors he did not “think skinny jeans are ever going away on the women’s side of the business”, despite a clear trend towards “casual, looser-fitting clothes in general”, according to Business Insider. McClendon added that they “always have a way of bouncing back. They are an extremely versatile and adaptable garment that carry such a multitude of cultural meanings that they will never be irrelevant.”"
2021-02-12T00:01:27Z,technology,Technology, Huawei to seek UK court order to access HSBC records in bid to clear CFO,"Huawei’s battle to prevent the extradition of its chief financial officer from Canada to the US will open a new front at the British high court on Friday when the Chinese telecoms giant seeks an application to access records from inside HSBC in a bid to prove that she did not mislead the bank. The future of Meng Wanzhou has become a major three-way point of diplomatic and legal tension between China, Canada and the US since she was arrested at Vancouver airport in December 2018. The US is seeking her extradition on charges of violating US sanctions when a company controlled by Huawei sold telecoms equipment to Iran. The US claims Meng did not tell the truth to HSBC about Huawei’s true links to Skycom, a firm that was active in Iran and allegedly a shell company for Huawei. Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, is alleged to have told HSBC senior executives in a PowerPoint presentation in August 2013 that Skycom was a simple partner and not a subsidiary. She held the meeting in Hong Kong with HSBC’s Asia-Pacific director of global banking, Alan Thomas. Her detention has severely strained relations between Canada and China, which has been accused of “hostage diplomacy” for the detention of two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, soon after Meng’s arrest. At the high court in London, Huawei will on Friday seek an order under the Bankers Book Evidence Act to access what they regard as relevant information kept in HSBC’s books. Under this act, a party can seek a court order to gain access to, inspect and copy documentation such as ledgers, cashbooks and accounts books. Meng’s lawyers have claimed the presentation to HSBC has been edited in a bid to make it look as though she misrepresented the relationship between Huawei and Skycom. The request for a court order, Huawei says, is to understand who in HSBC had knowledge of the meeting in Hong Kong, the contents discussed during that meeting, and how widely the outcome of the meeting circulated within the bank. The meeting had been requested by the bank after Reuters news agency published a series of stories in the spring of 2013 alleging that the links between Skycom and Huawei were closer than the Chinese firm had acknowledged. Huawei also wants to know the reasons HSBC maintained its relationship with the Chinese firm after the publication of the Reuters articles and why it cleared Skycom transactions through the US banking system. The UK case appears to be part of Huawei’s efforts to make the question of Meng’s future an ever larger diplomatic headache. Meng is due to appear in a Vancouver court on 1 March for the last stage of her extradition hearings, which are scheduled to finish in May at the earliest. Her lawyers have attempted various arguments to get her extradition stopped, including claiming that her actions did not represent an offence in Canada, and that the nature of her investigation at the airport by Canada border officials amounted to a cross-examination."
2021-02-11T18:40:34Z,technology,Technology,Facebook moderators 'told not to discuss working conditions',"Facebook has been accused of using nondisclosure agreements to try to build a “wall of secrecy” and prevent its moderators from discussing working conditions with Leo Varadkar, the Irish tánaiste (deputy PM). The moderators claim that Facebook warned them they could not break a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) they had signed with the company during discussions with Varadkar, and warned them that any discussion of their work outside the office would be treated as a disciplinary offence. The workers, who are being forced to work in the company’s Dublin office throughout Ireland’s high-tier lockdown, were afraid of being sacked if they spoke to Varadkar about their working conditions. They sought guarantees from the company that they would not face legal action for doing so. Instead, according to correspondence seen by the Guardian, Facebook gave only partial permission. The company said it had “no issue” with the moderators “discussing matters relating to their work” or “other information that is in the public domain” but, it added, they could not share information covered by their “contractual confidentiality obligations”. In a follow-up letter, the workers asked Facebook and Covalen, the third-party contracting firm that is their direct employer, for a copy of those obligations, but received no reply. Phoenix Law, the human rights lawyers representing the moderators, said the workers had not seen a copy of their nondisclosure agreements since they signed them on their first day of work. “Facebook requires content moderators to sign a confidentiality agreement at the end of induction training, without furnishing copies of the materials or agreements,” the moderators alleged. They say that as recently as 18 January, just a few days before the meeting with Varadkar was scheduled, “moderators working for Facebook were warned that any discussion of their work outside of the Facebook office would be treated as a disciplinary offence”. Facebook argues that because the moderators are directly employed by Covalen, it has no direct responsibility for their communications. In a statement, the social network said: “Facebook has legal obligations to protect user data and personal information. “These obligations require Facebook to have confidentiality, privacy and security terms in their supplier contracts, and for their suppliers to convey these obligations to their employees – either through legal documents like NDAs, training, or other means. “The confidentiality agreements that Covalen employees sign are issued and retained by their employer, Covalen. Facebook does not have NDAs with these content moderators.” The workers are being supported by Foxglove, a London-based human rights non-profit that fights to “make tech accountable”. Foxglove’s cofounder, Cori Crider, said: “We were able to say: ‘These people have the right to speak publicly,’ and Facebook knew that they couldn’t come in and try to stop these people talking to the former prime minister.” In a statement, Covalen said: “As part of our recruitment process, every Covalen employee receives a confidentiality agreement via email, along with their employment contract. “Covalen requires each employee to sign the confidentiality agreement and return via email, together with their employment contract, before commencing employment. “As such, there is never an instance where an employee does not receive a copy of their confidentiality agreement. If an employee misplaces their copy of the confidentiality agreement, our human resources team is more than happy to provide them with a copy. “Covalen respects the rights of our employees to meet with public representatives but we always encourage employees, when issues arise relating to their employment, to engage with the company through our internal processes first in order to see if they can be resolved.” In October, as Ireland was entering a high-tier lockdown in which only essential workers were allowed to leave their homes, Facebook moderators working for the contracting firm CPL, a Covalen subsidiary, were told that they were still required to attend the office. The moderators were told that they were classed as “essential communications workers”, and while shielding moderators were allowed to remain at home, those who had vulnerable relatives at home were given no such leeway. In the first two months alone, three cases were linked to the office. As well as Covid safety, the Facebook moderators discussed the “climate of fear” that pervades their workplace with Varadkar. “Through a culture of excessive secrecy and over-broad NDAs, Facebook has chilled moderators’ right to assembly and expression, to access representatives and to blow the whistle about unsafe working conditions,” they said. “Quality scores, extremely granular time tracking (including tracking, for example, bathroom time) and other workplace surveillance create a culture that is undignified and causes moderators needless stress.”"
2021-02-11T17:25:40Z,technology,Technology,Google apps feel strain as firm's privacy standoff with Apple drags on,"Google’s privacy standoff with Apple has lasted so long that even the company’s own apps are complaining about it. Since early December, Apple has required any iOS app to include a privacy “nutrition label”, listing all the ways the app uses personal data. Those labels, which are written by the app developers, range from short and sweet – the podcast app Overcast, for instance, lists six uses of personal data, from usage information for analytics to user IDs for the app’s sign-in functionality – to somewhat longer. Facebook lists 80 different data categories it uses, for purposes from tracking users around the web to personalising the app. Google, however, has yet to provide its own labels. The company only has to do so when it updates its apps, which it stopped doing late last year. The iOS version of Google Chrome, for instance, was updated roughly every two weeks throughout 2020, until two months ago when it received its last update. Google Photos was updated almost weekly until two months ago; so too were YouTube, Google Maps and Gmail. In fact, of the 86 apps Google has published on the iOS App Store, only three – Google Slides, Google Play Music and TV, and Google Translate – have been updated in 2021. Of those three, just one – Google Translate – has a privacy label, which lists 25 ways personal data may be used. The vast majority of the remaining 83 apps received their most recent update two months ago, shortly before the new requirements came into effect. On Wednesday night, Google’s apps began to complain about the lack of updates. According to user reports posted on social media, a number of apps including Gmail, Google Maps and Google Photos issued notices warning their users that the app was “out of date”, despite the fact the users were on the latest version. “You should update this app,” the warning read. “The version you’re using doesn’t include the latest security features to keep you protected. Only continue if you understand the risks.” Google was unable to immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian , but a spokesperson told the tech site The Verge that the error message was a “bug”. Others such as the TechMeme editor, Spencer Dailey, speculated that the “bug” was in fact “an automatic check of how long it has been since the app was last updated”, which was not expected to be triggered since in normal times a two month-old version of the app would definitely be out of date. Google will shortly face further pressures from Apple’s privacy push. In a forthcoming update to iOS, a new feature called “App Tracking Transparency” will require applications to ask for permission before they are able to track users around the web. The setting has sparked strong pushback from Facebook, which argues it will hurt online advertising, but to date Google has been quiet about how it intends to respond to the requirement."
2021-02-11T03:35:35Z,technology,Technology,Instagram removes anti-vaxxer Robert F Kennedy Jr for false Covid-19 claims,"The prominent anti-vaxxer Robert F Kennedy Jr has been booted from Instagram for repeatedly sharing false claims about Covid-19 and the safety of vaccines. Facebook confirmed on Wednesday that it had removed the profile of Kennedy Jr, a vaccine skeptic who chairs the Children’s Health Defense – a group that baselessly ties chronic childhood conditions to a number of factors including vaccines – as part of the social media platform’s efforts to remove vaccine misinformation. Kennedy’s Instagram account was actioned “for repeatedly sharing debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines”, said a spokesperson for Facebook, which owns Instagram.
Kennedy’s Facebook account, however, remains active, despite promoting false, dangerous claims about the safety of vaccines and Covid-19 treatments. A company spokesperson said that Facebook does not automatically disable users across various platforms. A 2019 study found that the majority of Facebook ads spreading misinformation about vaccines were funded by two groups: Kennedy’s organization, which was launched in 2016 under the name World Mercury Project, and Stop Mandatory Vaccinations, a project launched by the anti-vaccine crusader Larry Cook. Facebook and Instagram have struggled to contain a deluge of misinformation and conspiracy theories about Covid-19 vaccines, and vaccines in general. The company pledged in December to remove all debunked claims about Covid-19 vaccines, and this week said it planned to expand that crackdown to include false claims about all vaccines. The new community guidelines will apply to user-generated posts as well as paid advertisements. Facebook groups, in particular, have been found to fuel the rise of anti-vaccine communities. Despite its latest policy to combat misinformation, conspiracy theories and false claims about vaccines and the virus remain on the company’s social media platforms. Kennedy, the son of the former US attorney general Bobby Kennedy, has been criticized by members of his family, including his brother, sister and niece for spreading false information about vaccines that they said was “tragically wrong”."
2021-02-10T07:00:29Z,technology,Technology,Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 review: four months with the folding tablet-phone,"Are phones that unfold into tablets really the future of mobiles? And is flexible screen technology really ready for prime time? I spent four months with the £1,800 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 to find out. The second iteration of Samsung’s smartphone that unfolds into a tablet was impressive on first inspection, reinventing what it meant to be a premium, cutting-edge device. But as with any piece of brand-new technology, particularly those that involve delicate moving parts, durability is a worry. After four months of folding and unfolding it about 30 times a day, I can report that the screen is still pristine and everything still works as well as it did fresh out of the box. But I’ve also learned more about what works and what doesn’t, and how Covid-19 has changed the way I use devices. The screen
The screen has survived four months of use without a scratch, despite being made of softer, potentially scratch-prone material. I didn’t leave it open on a table in the same way I might a tablet, as shutting it away felt satisfying and natural. Closed, it is fully protected on a table or in your pocket. The lips around the edge of the screen prevent any ingress of dirt or fluff, despite the USB-C port attracting the usual pocket lint just like any other phone. The internal screen is a fingerprint magnet and requires frequent cleaning. That’s because unlike the screen on the outside of the Z Fold 2 or that on a regular smartphone, the internal display isn’t constantly being cleaned the fabric of a pocket or similar. A quick buff-up with a lens cloth was enough to restore the tablet screen’s pristine look.
Apart from Samsung’s and a few third-party apps, not many have a full tablet-sized interface on the internal screen when held in portrait. However, many more websites and apps do resize properly to the big screen when the device is held in landscape. That’s because the screen is taller than it is wide. When flipping it on its side, many apps and sites, including the Guardian, recognise the width as being beyond phone-size and give you a larger display meant for a tablet or laptop. General use
I used the Fold 2 as a standard phone with the big screen closed more often than expected. The outside screen is large enough to get most phone things done, from messaging people to checking my abysmal Fantasy Premier League performance. I often started searches on the outside screen and then opened up the Fold 2 to see an image or map on the inside screen. But using it closed highlighted an issue with the fingerprint scanner. It is small and suffers more from getting dirt and grease on both it and your fingers than larger sensors. I often had to clean it with my jumper for it to recognise my thumb. The issue is compounded by the fact you cannot register a fingerprint when the main screen is closed, only when it is open. Given that I almost always unlock the device before opening it, I have to try to guess roughly where my finger would naturally land when registering it. Recording my thumbprint twice helped, but the fingerprint sensor is a weak point of the phone.
The continuing Covid-19 pandemic is also changing the way I use devices. Being stuck at home means I open the internal screen less, primarily because there are larger screens in the form of tablets, laptops and TVs always within reach. Even though foldable devices are clearly the future, the two-in-one benefit of the Z Fold 2 is somewhat lost at the moment. Frequent but careful cleaning of the device with Dettol wipes has yet to cause an issue, despite the lack of water resistance. You need a good, strong car mount to hold it on a dashboard; the phone’s 282g weight will be too much for some. Using two apps side-by-side on the internal screen proved to be useful for chats and watching the football scores, but less so for watching video as the picture was just too small. The battery holds up well, comfortably still outlasting the day. Samsung recently released One UI 3 (Android 11) for it, which is good. All in all, after four months, the novelty of the Z Fold 2 has yet to wear off. It still feels like an incredibly special device, as it should when it costs £1,800, but one you can easily live with day to day and use to its full extent. Nothing else quite has the wow factor. I’m not saying everyone should buy one – this is a device purely for the well heeled – but if you do, you’ll be richly rewarded. And for the rest of us, it proves that devices like the Z Fold 2, which can fill more than one role and still fit in your pocket, can and will be in our futures once the price comes down to more acceptable levels."
2021-02-09T21:52:43Z,technology,Technology,Fears over DNA privacy as 23andMe goes public in deal with Richard Branson,"The genetic testing company 23andMe will go public through a partnership with a firm backed by the billionaire Richard Branson, in a deal that has raised fresh privacy questions about the information of millions of customers. Launched in 2006, 23andMe sells tests to determine consumers’ genetic ancestry and risk of developing certain illnesses, using saliva samples sent in by mail. Privacy advocates and researchers have long raised concerns about a for-profit company owning the genetic data of millions of people, fears that have only intensified with news of the partnership. “The question in all situations like this is where the data is going and why these different companies and investors have a financial interest in your genetic data,” said Jennifer King, a privacy specialist at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence who has studied 23andMe. 23andMe and Branson’s company will team up through a special purpose acquisition company (Spac), also known as a blank-check company. Such firms are created by investors with the sole purpose of raising capital as an alternative to the traditional IPO process, in which capital is raised before a company goes public. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter, after which the company will begin trading on the New York stock exchange under the ticker symbol ME. Branson and Anne Wojcicki, the 23andMe CEO and co-founder, each donated $25m to the $250m Spac fund. The merger valued the company – with its 10 million-customer genome database – at $3.5bn, including debt. According to a spokesperson, 23andMe shareholders are retaining 81% ownership of the combined company and its research program will continue to be overseen by an independent institutional review board.
In a presentation by the Virgin Acquisition Group announcing the deal, the firm said research and health treatments offered by 23andMe represented the largest long-term value to its investors. The group cited the “vast proprietary dataset” of DNA that would allow Virgin to “unlock revenue streams across digital health, therapeutics, and more”. The presentation also noted that products like a subscription service with health insights could be the future of 23andMe. That shift from ancestry testing to health tests at 23andMe has been under way for a while. Wojcicki told the Wall Street Journal last week that the core ancestry testing line of their product had weakened in recent years. “There is absolutely that slowdown,” she told the newspaper regarding 23andMe’s shift into the health market. “We have always seen health as a much bigger opportunity.” The company has also shared user data with GlaxoSmithKline for use in developing drugs. In 2018, 23andMe was investigated by the FTC for its privacy practices, but the inquiry was closed in 2019 after the FTC found 23andMe followed best practices for data privacy. A spokesperson from 23andMe told the Guardian all its DNA samples were processed in the US and it did not share customer data with any third parties “without the separate, explicit consent of the customer”. Customers could opt to have their DNA sample destroyed or stored at the 23andMe lab, and they could close their accounts at any time. “No customer data is shared with Virgin or anyone else as part of the proposed transaction,” the spokesperson said. 23andMe claims user data is only shared outside the company through opt-in agreements (80% of users opt in to research) and says data is only shared when anonymized and in aggregate, unless customers separately agree to have their anonymized data shared individually. The company’s privacy statement notes that in the event of a merger, customer data “would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy statement”. The explosion in access to DNA testing has had a number of unintended privacy effects, including outing family secrets, uniting the children of previously anonymous sperm donors, and solving decades-old cold cases. Some DNA companies have reportedly shared data with the FBI. Pentagon leadership has encouraged military personnel not to take 23andMe tests due to privacy concerns. By the nature of DNA, a user who takes a test also shares insights into their ancestors and children. Even if 23andMe does prioritize consumer privacy, the risk of others accessing the data in a security breach could be catastrophic, said Greg Touhill, a professor of cybersecurity at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College. Incidents at other DNA companies show this risk is not theoretical: in 2019 a breach of one genetics website exposed the DNA data of more than 1 million people. “The cybersecurity implications regarding the safeguarding of this data are huge,” said Touhill. “If your computer is hacked, you can change your passwords. You can’t change your DNA.” 23andMe takes a number of intensive security measures to keep data secure, its spokesperson said. Its information management system has been certified under three different independent security standards and all data is encrypted in transit. The company also stores personal, identifiable customer information (such as name and email) separately from DNA data. This article was amended on 10 February 2021. A earlier version misstated the status of the FTC investigation, which concluded in 2019."
2021-02-09T19:05:10Z,technology,Technology,Cryptocurrencies rise in popularity in world's conflict zones,"People in the world’s major conflict zones are turning to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as soaring values and the backing of super-rich investors make them more attractive. Online searches for bitcoin, ethereum and dogecoin have increased in Libya, Syria and Palestine, pushing aside the usual focus of interest in stock markets and safe-haven investments in gold and property. Publicity surrounding the new breed of digital currencies has spread across the world since the pandemic struck and meant users have also looked to them as a way to borrow when banks have become reluctant to lend money. Tesla’s owner, Elon Musk, is among the most high-profile supporters, adding his tweets of approval to other celebrity backers including the actor Gwyneth Paltrow, the rapper Snoop Dogg, and the billionaire former Microsoft chair Bill Gates. Last week Tesla bought $1.5bn in bitcoin in a move that propelled the currency to a high of almost $43,500. It has since increased again to almost $48,000 before falling back on Tuesday to $46,250, an increase of more than 300% since February last year. Digital currencies, unlike the pound, dollar and euro, are not backed by a central bank that can print money to meet growing demand. There are a fixed number of bitcoins and they are traded and registered on a ledger that is not part of the banking system or visible to regulators. Analysis by TradingView, one of the top 100 most-visited websites in the world, found that countries that rank at the bottom of the Human Freedom Index, or that are politically turbulent for other reasons, appear in the top 10 countries for online digital currency searches.
Using data from 27m search inquiries from its 100 million users between November 2020 and January 2021, the firm found that when searches were calculated as a percentage of all inquiries, more than half in Cuba (50.4%) were made about cryptocurrency assets, an increase of 12.2% on last year. Online inquires made up 42.2% of the total in Libya, 41.9% in Ukraine and 38.7% in Palestine, putting them all in the top five for cryptocurrency searches while Syria at 36.9% was 10th, suggesting that countries with high levels of instability are proportionally more interested in digital assets than more developed nations. James Maddison, the UK head of TradingView, said he could only speculate about why digital currencies were becoming popular in less developed countries, but a switch away from hard currencies was likely to be popular in areas of the world where it was difficult to access foreign currency, hoarding cash was subject to crime, and restrictions on lending by high-street banks and the closure of branches were common."
2021-02-09T17:55:40Z,technology,Technology,Snapchat Spotlight: feature gives rival TikTok a run for its money,"Pet influencers are nothing new on social media. From Marnie the shih tzu (RIP) to Grumpy Cat (also RIP), there’s a long history of animals becoming famous on the internet – and their owners making a quick buck off them in turn. But Crusha, a nine-year-old black-and-white moggy from Norfolk, is not a typical social media star. For one thing, she’s only featured in one video, and it’s not exactly glamorous: a misstep as she scampers across a conservatory roof leaves her slowly sliding down plastic sheeting before she catches herself just at the last minute and scurries back up with an indignant mew. But more importantly, her owner, 19-year-old Jack, didn’t need to launch a cash-in calendar, sell T-shirts with her face on them, or put up sponsored posts with captions declaring a particular brand of pet food purrfect, in order to suddenly find himself in the rare group of people whose pets have made them more money than they’ve cost. He just posted the video to Snapchat, and a few weeks later received a notification from the app that he was in line for a payout of almost $20,000. “My mum told my grandparents, her mum and dad, and they were like, ‘that’s not real, you won’t get that’”, Jack said. “I tried to explain to them that I didn’t think Snapchat, a huge multibillion-dollar company, is going to scam someone out of their money.” Jack is one of the UK’s largest beneficiaries to date of a new feature on Snapchat, called Spotlight, which was introduced late last year in an effort to head off competition from Chinese rival TikTok. At its heart, Spotlight is a stream of short video clips, algorithmically curated and presented to users with just a flick of the thumb required to move on to the next clip – just like its rival. But Spotlight differs in a few key ways from its competition. One is that, unlike TikTok, and almost every other social media platform, the app doesn’t care – or even ask – about who you want to follow. While the video clips are lightly personalised, based on which content users have engaged with in the past, there’s no ability to follow users who have posted good content. That’s deliberate, because, according to insiders, the feeling at Snapchat is that social media stars get big, then get lazy. If you’re guaranteed millions of views whatever you post, then the temptation to just coast along with mediocre content and a few adverts can ruin the network as a whole. Instead, Spotlight treats every post – whether it comes from a Disney channel star, or a 19-year-old from Norfolk – the same, showing them to a small fraction of users to gauge interest, and then more and more until the best have millions of views. In fact, Spotlight, uniquely, allows creators to post while remaining anonymous. “That’s one of my favourite things about spotlight compared to other social medias,” Jack says. “You can still entertain other people while not having to, you know, put yourself out there fully. I haven’t put my face on anything – it’s not really my type of thing to get a huge following and have my face online everywhere.” That’s what propelled Crusha to stardom. But Jack’s bank account was helped by the other unique feature of Spotlight: the service pays creators directly. Every day since it launched, Snapchat has allocated $1m to split between the creators of the most popular videos. As ever, everything is bigger in America, and there, some of the wealthiest beneficiaries have earned millions from their videos. With dedication, some have cracked the algorithm’s intricacies to the point that they have been able to get multiple videos across that threshold, rather than just waiting for lightning to strike – or a cat on a cold plastic roof – like Jack did. But $20,000 is a lot of money to come from nowhere. Jack doesn’t plan on buying a diamanté collar for Crusha, though: instead, more sensible uses of the money are planned. “I’m saving it at the moment,” he says, “because later this year I’m trying to get an apprenticeship in London as a software developer.” If Snap had an apprenticeship programme, he added, they would be at the top of his list."
2021-02-08T23:44:12Z,technology,Technology,Facebook bans misinformation about all vaccines after years of controversy,"Facebook has banned misinformation about all vaccines following years of harmful, unfounded health claims proliferating on its platform. As part of its policy on Covid-19-related misinformation, Facebook will now remove posts with false claims about all vaccines, the company announced in a blogpost on Monday. These new community guidelines apply to user-generated posts as well as paid advertisements, which were already banned from including such misinformation. Instagram users will face the same restrictions. “We will begin enforcing this policy immediately, with a particular focus on Pages, groups and accounts that violate these rules,” said Guy Rosen, who oversees content decisions. “We’ll continue to expand our enforcement over the coming weeks.” Groups on Facebook have been known to create echo chambers of misinformation and have fueled the rise of anti-vaccine communities and rhetoric. Under the new policy, groups where users repeatedly share banned content will be shut down. Facebook has repeatedly updated its policies on Covid-19 content as the pandemic has evolved. In April 2020, it began to add to posts about coronavirus a panel of facts from the CDC to combat misinformation. It often made misinformation about vaccines less visible on its platform but stopped short of removing it. This began to change in December, when the company strengthened its coronavirus policies and began to remove posts about Covid-19 that had been debunked by public health experts. This included posts suggesting vaccines contain microchips, claims that wearing a face mask does not help prevent the spread of Covid-19, and claims that 5G technology contributes to or causes coronavirus infections. Facebook will now broaden this ban, addressing false claims that Covid-19 is synthetic, that vaccines are not effective at preventing the disease, or that it’s safer to get the disease than to get the vaccine. The ban does not stop at Covid-related content and will also target falsehoods including suggesting vaccines cause autism – a baseless claim made by many in the anti-vax community. Despite the new policy, vaccine misinformation remains on Facebook and Instagram, which Facebook owns. Top search results for “Covid vaccine” on Instagram were still turning up conspiracy theory accounts on Monday morning. Facebook has faced criticism in recent months for its handling of Covid-19 misinformation. In December it allowed a prominent conspiracy theory video to go viral on the platform, and later it failed to successfully remove pages of a prominent anti-vaccine activist who continued to create new accounts after he was banned.

2021-02-08T16:30:49Z,technology,Technology,Napster to make debut on London stock market this month,"Napster is to make its debut on the London stock market later this month, marking the first time the music streaming pioneer has had its own public listing in a chequered 22-year history. Napster, which will start trading on the Alternative Investment Market from 26 February, is listing in London as a result of the company’s $70m (£53m) reverse takeover by a British music tech startup last summer. MelodyVR, which films and streams gigs fans watch with virtual reality headsets, said on Monday that it is raising up to £10m to fund the expansion of the streaming business, and plans to rebrand as Napster after the company’s general meeting later this month. The MelodyVR/Napster business now has a market value of about £100m.
“We are looking forward to rebranding as Napster,” said the MelodyVR chief executive, Anthony Matchett, who will now become chief executive of Napster, which is relaunching its app later this year. “This funding will support the development of our new Napster music service throughout the course of 2021.” The Swiss firm Nice & Green is buying £6.5m worth of the shares being placed in the fundraising move, with another £3.5m worth of stock open to retail investors. Last August, the six-year-old British company, which has hosted gigs by acts including Emeli Sandé, the Chainsmokers and Cypress Hill during lockdown, acquired Rhapsody International, which operated as Napster and was in turn owned by the Nasdaq-listed RealNetworks. As part of the cash and shares deal, RealNetworks continues to hold a 10% stake in the business. For the past six months the two businesses have been run separately – Napster’s headquarters are in Seattle, while MelodyVR is based in London – but they will now effectively be merged and led by the much bigger US international streaming business.
Napster makes about $130m in revenues annually from its almost 6 million music subscribers, who pay $9.99 or £9.99 a month, while MelodyVR turns over about £1m a year. By rebranding and putting the focus on Napster, the company will be aiming to benefit from investor cheer towards businesses seen to be capitalising on the streaming boom prompted by the coronavirus lockdown. Napster has a library of about 90m licensed tracks and its subscription base almost doubled from 3 million in December 2019 to 5.7 million at the end of last year. A shareholder vote to approve the merger and rebrand of MelodyVR as Napster is due to take place on 25 February. The overall business employs about 140 staff, with 90% of those based in Seattle."
2021-02-08T13:53:55Z,technology,Technology,"Tesla buys $1.5bn in bitcoin, pushing price to new high","Tesla, the electric car company run by the world’s richest person, Elon Musk, revealed on Monday that it had bought $1.5bn (£1.1bn) in bitcoin and said it might soon accept payment in the popular but controversial cryptocurrency. News of Tesla’s investment in bitcoin sent the digital currency soaring 14% to a record high of $43,500, a 300% increase on this time last year as cryptocurrency investment has moved into the mainstream as global interest rates remain at record lows. Tesla disclosed the bitcoin holding in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. The company said that it had “updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximise returns” to allow it to invest cash reserve in “alternative reserve assets including digital assets”. It said that since the decision was approved by its audit committee it had “invested an aggregate $1.5bn in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long term”.
The company added: “Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt.” The $1.5bn held in bitcoin represents about 8% of all the $19.4bn that Tesla holds in cash and liquid assets, according to the SEC filing. Musk has helped to drive the popularity of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and dogecoin, by regularly tweeting that he is a “supporter” of the cryptocurrencies. He has also joked that bitcoin is his “safeword”. Earlier this month the price of bitcoin soared after Musk said that he was a supporter of the cryptocurrency in an interview carried on Clubhouse, a new social media app designed for wealthy people. “I do think at this point bitcoin is a good thing,” he said. “And, so, I am a supporter of bitcoin. Like I said, I was late to the party, but I am a supporter of bitcoin. And I think, bitcoin is really on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional finance people.” He has previously changed his Twitter biography to “#bitcoin”. The price of dogecoin also rose after Musk tweeted about it. Dogecoin’s price increased by 50% on 4 February, shortly after he tweeted: “Dogecoin is the people’s crypto.” Dogecoin, which uses a shiba inu dog meme as its logo, was started in 2013 as a joke, after the invention of bitcoin prompted a wave of imitator cryptocurrencies. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Tesla’s embrace of cryptocurrency was a “potential gamechanging move for the use of bitcoin from a transactional perspective”. He said: “Investors and other industry watchers will be watching this closely to see if other corporations follow the lead of Tesla on this crypto path or, on the other hand, does it remain a contained few names that make this strategic jump around bitcoin.”
Simon Peters, a cryptoasset analyst at the investment platform eToro, thinks bitcoin could hit $50,000 by the end of the week. “If there were any doubters as to the mainstream acceptance of bitcoin, this surely must mark the end of any scepticism,” he said. “Multiple other brands already accept bitcoin as payment, and we would imagine that, in time, other major companies will follow Tesla’s example.” Eric Turner, the vice-president of market intelligence at cryptocurrency research firm Messari, said: “I think we will see an acceleration of companies looking to allocate to bitcoin now that Tesla has made the first move. One of the largest companies in the world now owns bitcoin and, by extension, every investor that owns Tesla, or even just an S&P 500 fund, has exposure to it as well.” However, others have told people to be careful before considering investing their savings in bitcoin. The Tesla investment came as the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, reiterated his scepticism about the digital currency. He told a committee of MPs on Monday that bitcoin has “no intrinsic value at all”. He said: “I’ve said a number of times, ‘Only buy bitcoin if you’re prepared to lose all your money.’ It doesn’t mean you will lose all your money, it doesn’t mean the value will go to nothing, but it has no intrinsic value … People may want it, they may want to collect it, but it doesn’t have any intrinsic value at all.” Meanwhile, Musk also announced on Monday that he had pledged $100m to a fund to develop technology that removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or oceans. Bitcoin has been criticised by environmentalists because it generates CO2 through the sheer amount of computing power it uses."
2021-02-08T07:00:34Z,technology,Technology,"TicWatch Pro 3 review: faster, slicker Wear OS smartwatch misses mark","Google’s TicWatch Pro 3 is the first Wear OS watch to use a newer, faster chip designed to breathe new life into the stagnant smartwatch line – but doesn’t do enough to manage the uphill task. Made by the Chinese tech firm Mobvoi, the new watch costs £289.99 and competes directly with Fossil’s Gen 5, as well as Samsung’s Galaxy watches on Android. It’s a big watch that manages to avoid being chunky, looking fairly nondescript with a black plastic body and silicone strap. It is quite light but designed for fairly large wrists – I had the strap pulled to its second-tightest position.
The large 1.4in screen has a trick up its sleeve: two displays laid directly on top of each other. The top layer is a low-power basic LCD “essential” display showing the time, date, steps and battery level but not notifications. Beneath the LCD display is a crisp and bright AMOLED screen that lights up when you are actively interacting with the watch, including showing apps, notifications and a standard smartwatch face. It is a clever solution for extending the battery life but not being able to see notifications at a glance is annoying and the switch between the two is quite jarring as the faces look nothing like each other. Instead, you can have the main screen stay on all the time like a regular smartwatch – which defeats the purpose of the dual display. The watch has two buttons, one for accessing apps and another that opens an exercise app by default but can be changed to launch another task. Neither buttons rotate for scrolling like those on competitors. One of the biggest problems with the watch is its weak haptics for alerts. Even set to its strongest setting, you are more likely to hear the motor than feel its vibrations. I routinely missed notifications and calls even with the watch strapped on tight. Specifications Screen: 1.4in AMOLED + LCD display Case size: 48mm Case thickness: 12.2mm Band size: standard 22mm Weight: 41.9g Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100 RAM: 1GB Storage: 8GB Operating system: Wear OS Water resistance: IP68 Sensors: barometer, ambient light, gyroscope, heart rate, SpO2, microphone, speaker NFC, GPS Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.2, wifi Smoother performance and two-day battery
There’s no doubt that a newer, faster and more efficient processor really helps the TicWatch. Everything is smoother, faster and more responsive with the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100 than other Wear OS watches, such as the Fossil Gen 5 using the previous Wear 3100 chip or older. But it is still nowhere near as fast or as slick as the Apple Watch, and lags slightly behind Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 3 and Watch Active 2 for Android phones. The TicWatch’s battery life varies greatly depending on the features enabled. In its default state with the basic display on all the time and without the tilt-to-wake gesture enabled for the main screen, you can get close to three days of use between charges. With the always-on main display option enabled, that drops to two days, which is still double most Wear OS watches. Turn on 24-hour heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring and you’ll have to reach for the charger every day and a half. A 25-minute run using GPS and heart rate consumed about 3% of the battery, which is fairly good for a smartwatch and long enough to last a marathon. The watch also has an “essential mode” that turns off everything but the basic screen showing, time, date, steps and your heart rate, plus sleep monitoring, allowing it to last up to 45 days between charges. You can turn it on manually or automatically when the battery hits 5% to make it last a bit longer. Sustainability
Mobvoi expects the battery in the TicWatch Pro 3 to last for at least 500 full charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% of its original capacity. The battery cannot be replaced, however, ultimately making the watch disposable.
The watch is generally repairable but the company says doing so is not possible outside China and so offers an out-of-warranty exchange programme in the UK instead, with discounts of between 30% and 40%. It is recyclable but does not contain recycled materials. Mobvoi does not offer recycling schemes in the UK. The watch ships with a USB-A charging cable but not a power adaptor. Wear OS
Wear OS is improving but continues to lag behind the competition in terms of features and design. Used with an Android phone you get solid notifications (if you can feel them), access to Google Assistant, widgets and a reasonable number of third-party applications. It also has Google Pay for contactless payments. But there are problems with features such as simple scrolling, where it’s very easy to accidentally tap something when you’re just trying to swipe your way through a list. The TicWatch is also not running the latest “H-MR2” version of Wear OS, which was announced by Google in September 2020 with significant feature and speed improvements and rolled out to competitor devices in December. Mobvoi will support the watch with software updates for two years from release and has provided two updates within the testing period. Also worth noting is that Wear OS currently has no support for storing music for offline playback (such as when running without a phone) from streaming music services, not even Google’s own YouTube Music. Note, too, that you cannot use it at all with Android phones that do not have Google Play Services, such as Huawei’s recent handsets. You can use it with an iPhone with limited functionality but I would not recommend it. Health and apps
Wear OS has a few health features built in with the Google Fit apps but the TicWatch ships with a suite of its own separate health and fitness apps including TicBreathe, TicExercise, TicHearing, TicOxygen, TicPulse, TicSleep, TicZen and the TicHealth app, which brings the readings all together. Most of the apps are self-explanatory and work well enough, monitoring stress, heartbeat with abnormal rate alerts and blood oxygen saturation, alongside the usual steps and activity monitoring. It does not feature an ECG sensor for monitoring for arrhythmia and I had issues with the accuracy of some apps. The sleep tracking produces detailed data but the time-to-sleep stats were way off, the resting heart rate was lower than I’ve ever recorded before and the smart alarm that is designed to wake you up at the right time in your cycle didn’t work.
Tracking runs worked a lot better, with a good amount of data including pace, cadence and distance recordings – similar to that produced by a Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar. The heart rate data was a bit variable but produced a good average reading, and the data took a long time to sync after a run. The TicExercise app caters for a number of activities including cycling, rowing, swimming and yoga but cannot automatically recognise workouts like competitors. The data is synced to Mobvoi’s servers rather than being kept purely on your device or phone, and can be viewed in the Mobvoi companion app on your phone. From there, you can export activities to Google Fit, Strava and Runkeeper. It works fine enough for the basic fitness and health tracking but variability in some more advanced data makes me question its accuracy. Observations
The watch is rated for IP68 water-resistance (at least 1m depths for 30 minutes) and “pool swimming” but not to the level of rivals that are often rated to depths of 30-50m. It has a speaker so you can hear Google Assistant answers and take calls from your wrist with an Android phone. A recent update added date and backlight customisation to the essential display. Price The TicWatch Pro 3 GPS costs £289.99. A model with 4G costs £329.99 but only works with Vodafone. For comparison, the Fossil Gen 5 has an RRP of £279.99, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 costs £399, the Apple Watch Series 6 costs £379 and the Fitbit Versa 3 costs £199.99. Verdict The TicWatch 3 Pro GPS has a lot of potential but ultimately misses the mark. The new Snapdragon Wear 4100 chip solves the remaining performance problems of previous Wear OS watches. The battery life is reasonable. The screen looks good and the dual-layer design is a smart way of prolonging battery when you really need it. But Wear OS just isn’t as slick or fully featured as rivals, the more advanced health-tracking features have accuracy issues, it is running old software compared with rivals and it is not cheap, costing £290. The deal killer for me is the weak vibration motor; I missed notifications I wouldn’t have wearing rivals, which just isn’t good enough. The battery cannot be replaced and the software will only be supported for two years from release, ultimately making it disposable and losing it a star. Pros: good performance, good battery life, big screen, dual-display, good notifications, Google Pay, standard 22mm straps, TicHealth fills the gaps in Google Fit health tracking. Cons: weak vibrations/alerts, Wear OS not as good as competitors, health-tracking accuracy issues, no offline music playback, battery not replaceable, only two years of software updates.

2021-02-07T13:00:11Z,technology,Technology,Are share-trading apps a safe way to play the markets?,"A year ago shares in struggling US video game store GameStop were worth just $3.25 a pop, yet at the end of last month they had reached $482. This stupendous surge was created by thousands of armchair traders, organising themselves on internet forums such as Reddit, who were attempting to outwit hedge funds who had placed massive bets on the chain’s decline in a process known as short-selling. This has resulted in billion-dollar losses for some hedge funds, and big profits for traders who cashed out before the stock fell back to less than $100. Many of these speculators were using a new generation of share-trading apps, such as eToro, Robinhood and Trading 212. Have these services tipped the scales of financial power in favour of the little guy? Here we answer some key questions … What’s the difference between these new apps and an established platform, such as Hargreaves Lansdown? There are two main differences between the new breed of trading apps and old-fashioned brokers. One is the cost, the other is the market. Apps, from Robinhood to Trading 212, have broken ground by offering trades “fee-free”. That’s a big difference from before, when an old-fashioned human broker would take a substantial cut for providing trading services and even newer online services – so-called eBrokers – would charge a flat fee per trade. Just as important is market access. Until recently, most small investors focused on buying and selling equities (shares), bonds (loans to companies and governments) and funds that aggregate bundles of tens or hundreds of other financial products. Trading apps broaden that out substantially. At one end of the spectrum, a growing number, including Robinhood and eToro, allow or even focus on trading cryptocurrencies – digital assets such as bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero – which tend to be very volatile. For those who want to stick with comparatively simple equities, the apps also offer financial tools that can increase the risk – and return – of bets, from buying on margin (taking out a loan to buy extra shares) to the world of options (bets that a particular stock will rise or fall a certain amount). These pay off handsomely if they’re correct, but are wiped out if they’re wrong.
Does it matter that all this is bundled together in a smartphone app? Surprisingly, it does. New research published by America’s National Bureau of Economic Research suggests that giving people the same trading abilities in an app as on a website or desktop computer affects how they trade. By following people who had access, through two German banks, to both smartphone and website trading, economists found that trading on a phone was likely to result in riskier decisions and encourage people to chase past returns – buying assets that were already near the top of the market. Those changes persisted even if the smartphone traders went back to their computers, suggesting that access to markets in their pocket fundamentally changed how they thought of day trading. One of eToro’s headline features is the ability to “copy” the trades of influencers on the platform. Why would you do that? Depending on who you listen to, there are a number of answers as to why you would do that, rather than entrust your money to fund managers with experience, qualifications and legal oversight. The influencers argue that users avoid paying the fund a fee and that by following influences who have real skin in the game – their own money invested in the trade – investors should expect better returns. A more cynical approach argues that if enough retail investors move in concert they can ultimately change the price of an asset, as seen in the rise and fall of GameStop’s share price. Of course, knowing when to sell is harder.
Some of the financial instruments users can invest in are quite complex – is that wise? Robinhood has repeatedly come under fire for the ease with which users can become hooked on – and then very rapidly lose a lot of money to – complex financial instruments. Take stock options: if you buy a stock for £20, and it rises to £25, you make £5; if it falls to £15, you lose £5. But if, instead, you spend £20 on buying 20 “call” options that guarantee you the right to buy the stock at £20, and it then rises to £25, you’ve made £100. But if you buy the call options and the stock falls even a single penny, you lose everything. The outsized risk and reward have earned the app criticism for being closer to gambling than investing. That is compounded by the fact that some users may not fully understand the products they’re buying – with tragic results. In July, 20-year-old day trader Alex Kearns killed himself after apparent confusion over a negative balance on the app, which suggested he owed $730,000. Some of these platforms offer commission-free trading, so how do they make money? The platforms argue – truthfully – that they keep their overheads low and that fees for trades were obsolete already, given the declining cost of operating in an all-digital market. And even for old-fashioned brokers, the main sources of income weren’t what you might expect: the cash float in customer accounts alone generated 57% of the net revenue of American broker Charles Schwab in 2018, for instance. That’s money that customers have deposited to buy shares, but have not yet used to make a purchase (or perhaps money they earned from a share purchase, but have not yet cashed out). The broker doesn’t pay an interest rate on it, but gets interest on the same money as it sits in its own accounts. The more controversial revenue source is payment for “order flow”. This sees large market makers – traditional City institutions who profit from the difference between the buy and sell price – pay retail brokers for the right to take their orders. The rationale is simple: if your job is to buy and sell stocks and a huge hedge fund asks you to buy £1m of a stock, you’re immediately going to be suspicious. What do they know that you don’t? What’s going to happen to the price of the stock after you agree to go and buy it for the hedge fund? But if a retail broker asks you to buy £1m of random stocks picked by disparate clients, you have no such concerns: it’s going to be much easier for you to get a good deal on those stocks. In fact, it’s going to be so much easier that it’s worth paying them to do it. But that financial relationship has caused unease over the past week. Citadel, a large American market maker, pays Robinhood for its order flow, for instance, but another arm of Citadel is directly invested in one of the hedge funds that was taking the other side of the bet over GameStop. When investors spotted the apparent conflict of interest, they cried foul and now Robinhood, rather than trying to help the poor or save Maid Marion, has spent a week trying to convince its customers that there is nothing untoward in its relationship. As these app-driven commotions destabilise stock markets, could they have an impact on real-world finances, such as the banking system, the value of pension funds and interest rates? The GameStop bubble, which really did cost some large hedge fund billions, suggests there are some new forms of systemic risk that the financial sector needs to deal with. In a way, the industry is seeing the same transformation that politics and the media have seen over the past 20 years: the discovery that huge numbers of people, coordinating themselves on platforms such as Reddit and Twitter, can become a force that is as powerful as the old institutions. It’s easy to see how such coordination could have far more damaging effects than a temporary bubble in a few “meme stocks” that cost certain hedge funds a lot of money: a deliberately coordinated run on a bank, an attempt to crash the exchange rate of a sparsely traded currency, or even a full-blown distributed takeover attempt could all have after-effects that would rock the real economy."
2021-02-07T09:45:07Z,technology,Technology,A picture of domestic bliss: why we've fallen in love with still life,"At a time when domesticity and what’s inside the home makes up the majority of what most people encounter in their daily lives, the still life is having a resurgence on social media – from influencers sharing their own photographs of satsumas and candles, to posting 18th-century paintings of shells and corals. The still-life hashtag has more than six million Instagram posts. Lucy Williams, an influencer with more than 490,000 followers, has been posting shots of lamps and lemons throughout lockdown. Fashion industry insider Ben Cobb recently shared an 18th-century still life by French painter Anne Vallayer-Coster on his feed, while interior designer Luke Edward Hall has been posting shots of just-opening narcissi against books. “One of our top-performing posts in the past 30 days is a still life painted by Rachel Ruysch,” says Abigail Tavener, social media manager at Sotheby’s London. Still lifes, she says, “can be counted among our best-performing content, with a handful of examples garnering more than 10,000 likes – double our average number of likes-per-post.” A clutch of artists are also giving the still life contemporary currency on Instagram. Sydney-based painter Gabrielle Penfold came to still lifes in a very Instagram-first way, after being struck by the craze for everyone documenting their food. She started painting similar scenes: “I would put it on Instagram and people would respond really well.” For her, this is what a still life is: “It’s something that resonates with people … nothing harsh to have hanging on your wall. It makes you feel happy – and, especially in these times, you want to feel good!” Miriam Dema is another of the artists. “What I like the most about still-life paintings is that they are a reflection of a specific moment … and that they give value to everyday elements that would otherwise be lost in oblivion.” Of course, not everyone has the luxury of being able to stay at home, but at a time when the domestic sphere makes up the majority of many people’s days, it also feels apt that a medium elevating the everyday – the literal bread and butter, or ephemera, of daily life – is finding fans. Hall has always enjoyed photographing bits and pieces at home but “because I’ve been spending much more time at home, I’ve naturally ended up taking more photographs in the house”.
Plus, he says, “maybe the pandemic has allowed us to look at existing things we have at home with fresh eyes? Perhaps people are rediscovering the joy of their homely objects, of cooking and growing things and then photographing the results?” While authentic to the genre, it also resonates that fruit, vegetables, seafood, wine and coffee often star – for many people food has become more central than usual. For a number of those composing or painting still lifes during the pandemic, they are an expression of ebullience. “To me, it represents the exaltation of beauty and the enjoyment of the senses,” says interior designer Pino Bravo, who recently posted lemons alongside a candle and a David Hume quote: “Beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty.” The movement ties into the ongoing love of tablescaping, a trend that means that shots of artfully laid tables are three-a-penny on Instagram, feeding into the still-life aesthetic. It has also been bolstered by the pandemic craze for knick-knacks. In July last year former lifestyle site Repeller declared: We’ve Reached Peak Tchotchke, referring to objects that are “decorative rather than strictly functional”. Pictures of ornaments have similarly been filtering on to Instagram, making content out of shots of vases and kitsch busts. Looking to art history, the still life genre has often been linked to mortality and death – the vanitas, for instance, is a type of still life specifically designed to remind the viewer of their own mortality. But the current crop on social media scream of life. Penfold describes her paintings of mackerel, artichokes, figs and cheese as “celebrations of life”. Hall also sees his shots of objects that way: “When I walk past a collection of favourite treasured objects, I’m filled with joy.”"
2021-02-06T08:00:36Z,technology,Technology,Virtual reality tourism ready for takeoff as travellers remain grounded,"With globe-trotting banned in the pandemic, increasing numbers of people are turning to virtual reality to relieve pent-up demand for travel. Escapism from the sofa through a growing range of VR travel experiences is whetting appetites for post-pandemic holidays and could be a watershed moment for the technology in tourism, say analysts. “As long as the pandemic increases and we are spending more time indoors, we should see adoption keep on growing,” said Ralph Hollister, a tourism analyst at Global Data and the author of a recent report on VR in tourism. Oculus launched its Quest 2 headset in October and the most popular experiences include National Geographic VR, which takes users to places such as Antarctica – where they can navigate icebergs in a kayak, climb an ice shelf and survive a raging snowstorm as they search for a lost emperor penguin colony. Another app, Wander, can teleport VR travellers from the pyramids of Egypt to the gardens of the Taj Mahal, while Alcove offers immersive experiences from hot air balloon rides to city tours. When We Stayed Home takes travellers to the heart of Paris, Venice, Jerusalem and Tokyo as they largely are today. Through the eyes of a local, you can witness the calm, the beauty and the emptiness of a places on pause during April 2020. “In this time of social distancing, people are looking for different ways to stay entertained, connected and active, and VR offers that,” said an Oculus spokesperson. “Whether you want to transport yourself to different places in the world, play with friends, get fit or just hang out together and feel like you’re in the same room, people are realising they can with VR.” One prominent adopter of pandemic VR is Germany’s national tourist board, which has unveiled a number of immersive projects. The Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation is using VR to showcase experiences such as beach yoga and snorkelling. Hollister said VR was still seen as a gimmick. “It remains to be seen if increased usage will last beyond when meaningful travel resumes.” But he believes it could. “I think the increase will be sustained, especially with the Gen Z and millennials in coming years, as they move into higher-paid jobs, and marketers take them more seriously as a consumer group. They will not feel alienated by the technology,” he said. Currently, VR is used in the pre-trip “dreamer” stage in tourism, with people looking at where they might want to go. Among the tourist operator Kuoni’s offerings, potential customers can take a 360-degree tour of the upmarket Sandy Lane luxury resort in Barbados. Hollister predicts that in the future people could use VR to book trips directly, as well as choosing seats on planes and hotel rooms with a click of the controller. “A lot of travellers and consumers want a seamless experience, to go from looking to booking with minimal clicks, instant gratification and saving as much time as possible,” he said. It has its limitations. ‘Tourism is also about touch, taste, smell, all those other sensory experiences, which is something VR cannot do,” he said. The price of high-quality headsets restricts access too. But as the world seeks more sustainable tourism, Hollister said VR also offered a solution. As historic sites are damaged through mass tourism, recreating them in VR could help conserve them. So this could be a watershed moment for VR and travel. “Everyone will be analysing that and working out its real worth to the industry,” he said. ‘More immersive than I could have imagined’ Angel Ross hoped to be travelling this year – and he has. He’s been cage diving with white sharks, kayaked in Antarctica and played poker in China – all virtually. Ross, who works for a London-based marketing firm, invested in an Oculus Quest 2 in January to satisfy his wanderlust after finding himself “stuck at home with the winter getting a bit depressing”. He said: “I love travelling. I am 22 and these are the years when I have been wanting to do a lot of things, and obviously can’t do anything right now. I love the ocean and I love snorkelling. On the Oculus you can dive with all these different animals, and it’s super immersive and realistic. “There’s a great white shark, you can get in a cage and it comes up to you. It was pretty terrifying but amazing. Then there’s more friendly animals like dolphins you can play with. I’ve done all of them, pretty much.” To make it more inclusive, he can cast what he is seeing on to his computer or TV to share with friends. “You feel quite disorientated when you come out, because you are really tricking your brain to think you are there,” he said. On the National Geographic VR app, he went on an Antarctic adventure. “I saw whales, I was in a kayak and you can climb an ice shelf. You really feel like you are walking and moving and going somewhere. All your senses – obviously not smell and touch – feel they are being completely absorbed. “I am a big poker player, with friends and not for money. And the poker on there is incredible. You can go to all these different locations. And one is this Chinese rooftop garden pool. Really cool.” He has also been rock climbing in the Alps, “which is super realistic – you chalk your hands and you can look around and see the drop. Pretty insane.” On YouTube VR he went in a drone up to 40,000ft to see the curvature of the Earth. “It’s even more immersive than I could have imagined. One hundred per cent,” he said . “Because it’s so immersive and intense, you can’t sit on it for hours on end. You need breaks. So you can have an intense, fun experience and do so many different things, invigorate your senses. And then you just stop, have a break. And you don’t need that constant fix.”"
2021-02-05T18:07:38Z,technology,Technology,Blow to Amazon as Alabama warehouse workers given go-ahead for union vote,"Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama will be allowed to conduct a union election by mail, the US’s top labor relations agency said on Friday, in a major blow to the online retail giant’s intense anti-union efforts.
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled that union ballots for workers at Amazon’s Bessemer fulfillment center, located outside of Birmingham, can be mailed out on 8 February after Amazon raised objections to the vote taking place by mail. Voting by mail has become commonplace during the pandemic. But in an appeal to the NLRB, attorneys for Amazon argued that a mail-in election would take too long and involve too many resources. Amazon proposed in January that the election take place in person over the course of four days in the fulfillment center’s parking lot, even as Alabama sees about 2,000 new cases of coronavirus every day. On Friday, the NLRB said in a brief ruling that the company “raises no substantial issues warranting review” and denied Amazon’s attempt to delay the election. About 5,800 employees are expected to receive union ballots. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) is leading unionization efforts and will represent the workers if they vote to unionize. Amazon’s business has been thriving during the pandemic, but the company has been criticized for not implementing safety measures in its warehouse as the virus raged. Efforts to unionize warehouse workers have popped up at fulfillment centers across the country, but the push to unionize in Alabama has so far been the most successful. If workers vote to unionize, it would be the first union of Amazon warehouse workers. Leading up to the union vote, Amazon launched a campaign attempting to strongly discourage workers from voting to unionize. The company set up an anti-union website and sent texts to workers claiming that unionizing means “giving up the right to speak for yourself” and that the union will be taking “your money for nothing”. “Once again, Amazon workers have won another fight in their effort to win a union voice,” said Stuart Appelbaum, RWDSU president, in a statement following the NLRB’s ruling. “Today’s decision proves that it’s long past time that Amazon start respecting its own employees; and allow them to cast their votes without intimidation and interference.”"
2021-02-05T05:51:20Z,technology,Technology,Google launches News Showcase in Australia in sign of compromise over media code,"The parent company of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age has dismissed Google’s offer to pay media organisations with the launch of News Showcase in Australia, stating it would not negotiate with the tech giant before the news media code comes into effect. Google launched its News Showcase product in Australia on Friday with seven Australian publishers Google will pay to host content in Showcase. The initial deals cover 25 mastheads, including the Canberra Times, the Illawarra Mercury, the Saturday Paper and Crikey. The move is seen as a softening of Google’s position against the news media code, with an aim to get as many publishers signed up to Showcase as possible before the code comes into effect. Google is understood to be in discussions with several other publishers to sign deals to be part of the Showcase. One of the biggest news media outlets, Nine – which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, and the Australian Financial Review – dismissed the launch, indicating it would not participate in negotiations until the code is brought in. “This is what monopolies do, they put an offer, in the form of Google Showcase, but not offer to negotiate,” a Nine spokesman said. “It has to be all on their terms and that is not an approach we will participate in, we support the legislation the government is proposing as the best way to secure a fair payment for our content.” Guardian Australia has sought comment from News Corp – the other major publisher to benefit from the code, however News Corp publication the Australian reported the offer was “unlikely to satisfy” the company. An ABC spokeswoman declined to comment, but said the national broadcaster is in ongoing discussions with Google. Showcase puts publishers’ content in panels providing more information and content from news websites than is found in search results or snippets in Google News. The panels appear on Google News on Android, iOS, mobile websites, and Discover on iOS, with plans for it to appear in search in the future. Publishers also have access to analytics from Showcase to show how content performs. Google had previously withheld bringing the News Showcase product to Australia as part of its US$1bn global investment in news over disagreement about the Australian government’s proposed news media code. The federal government plans to proceed with legislation that would force Google and Facebook to enter into negotiations with media companies over payment for content, with an arbiter to decide the final deal if no agreement can be reached.
Google has threatened to withdraw its search product from Australia as a worst case scenario if the code goes ahead, but prime minister Scott Morrison indicated on Thursday the company was moving ahead with negotiations with Australian publishers to include them in Showcase, which could ultimately lead to a compromise to prevent Google search exiting Australia. Morrison said on Thursday he had held a “constructive” meeting with the Google chief executive, Sundar Pichai, this week where the prime minister urged Google to “conclude the arrangements … with the various news media organisations in Australia – and that is the best way to enable that matter to be settled”. The comment suggests the government may be open to compromise in how the code could be applied to Google should the company reach agreements with enough publishers before the legislation passes and comes into effect. Google and Facebook are the only two digital platforms designated by the government as being subject to the code. This designation can be changed by the minister without the need to amend the legislation, meaning platforms can be added or removed, or the government could deem only parts of the platform would be subject to the code. Google already successfully lobbied the government to exclude YouTube from the code. In a statement on Friday, a Google spokesman said the company was “looking forward to bringing more Australian media partners on board in the coming weeks and months as we further build out the experience for publishers and users”.
On Thursday, Morrison indicated he was more optimistic Google would remain in Australia after his meeting with Pichai. “I think we have been able to get that into a much more positive space about the ability to continue to provide services here in Australia,” he said. “But at the end of the day, they understand that Australia sets the rules for how these things operate. And I was very clear about how I saw this playing out.” On Friday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said some of Google’s “threats have been misplaced … because they certainly see a future in the Australian market”. Google Search accounts for over 90% of the search market in Australia. Microsoft – the company behind its nearest rival, Bing – has promised to invest in substantial improvements in its search engine if Australians are locked out of Google Search. Morrison has also held a meeting with the Facebook chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, which was also described as “constructive” but did not dissuade the government from proceeding with the code. Note: Guardian Australia has been in discussion with Google over inclusion in its new Showcase offering that would see the company pay news providers for inclusion in this product."
2021-02-04T20:54:58Z,technology,Technology,Two Google engineers quit over company's treatment of AI researcher,"Two Google engineers have quit over the treatment of Timnit Gebru, a prominent Black artificial intelligence researcher whose exit from the company sparked widespread outrage in the tech industry. David Baker, an engineering director focused on user safety, left Google last month after 16 years because Gebru’s departure “extinguished my desire to continue as a Googler”, he said in a letter seen by Reuters. Baker added: “We cannot say we believe in diversity, and then ignore the conspicuous absence of many voices from within our walls.” Vinesh Kannan, a software engineer, said on Wednesday that he had also left the company this week because Google had mistreated Gebru and April Christina Curley, a Black recruiter who has said she was wrongly fired from Google last year. “They were wronged,” Kannan said in a tweet. Gebru, a scientist who is highly respected in her field, has said that she was fired in December after she pushed back on orders to pull research that speech technology like Google’s could disadvantage marginalized groups. Gebru has also said her dismissal followed an internal email in which she expressed frustration over Google’s diversity programs. Also in December, Curley shared a Twitter thread in which she alleged a number of racist incidents at Google before being fired. She said she had been asked to disclose her Baltimore accent as a disability and was told she was “intimidating” and thus not considered for leadership opportunities. Google declined to comment but pointed to previous statements that it is looking to restore employees’ trust after Gebru’s departure and that it disputes Curley’s accusation.
The resignations come as workers demand commitments to academic freedom and management change in Google’s research division. For years employee action over discrimination at Google has been mounting. In November 2018, thousands of employees around the world staged walkouts to protest against sexual harassment and systemic racism. In a complaint filed by the national labor relations board (NLRB) last week, the company was accused of unlawfully surveilling and firing workers who organized protests. More than 800 people have joined a union announced last month to advance workplace protections, and more than 2,600 of its 135,000 employees signed a December letter supporting Gebru. “The termination is an act of retaliation against Dr Gebru, and it heralds danger for people working for ethical and just AI – especially Black people and People of Color – across Google,” said the letter, published by the same group that organized a walkout at Google over the company’s treatment of sexual harassment and gender discrimination. “Research integrity can no longer be taken for granted in Google’s corporate research environment, and Dr Gebru’s firing has overthrown a working understanding of what kind of research Google will permit. This is also a moment of reckoning beyond Google.” Baker, whose resignation letter was shared with an internal affinity group for Black employees, told Reuters he stood by his remarks. Kannan did not have an immediate comment. Reuters contributed to this report"
2021-02-04T17:05:43Z,technology,Technology,TikTok to introduce warnings on content to help tackle misinformation,"TikTok is to feature banner warnings on suspect content in a bid to dissuade users from sharing videos featuring misinformation. Its new tool, which will launch in the UK on 22 February, is one of the first from a major social platform to target not just content that has been shown to be false, but also that has not, or cannot, be conclusively proved to be true. “Sometimes fact-checks are inconclusive or content is not able to be confirmed, especially during unfolding events,” said Gina Hernandez, a product manager with TikTok’s trust and safety team. “In these cases, a video may become ineligible for recommendation into anyone’s For You feed to limit the spread of potentially misleading information. “Today, we’re taking that a step further to inform viewers when we identify a video with unsubstantiated content in an effort to reduce sharing.” Users who are watching such videos will see a banner near the top of the video if the content has already been reviewed by TikTok’s fact-checking partner Logically and not validated. If they try to share it, they will see a further warning that the video has been flagged as “unverified”.
“When we tested this approach, we saw viewers decrease the rate at which they shared videos by 24%, while likes on such unsubstantiated content also decreased by 7%,” Hernandez added. The ability to mark posts as unverified could help limit the spread of claims which, while baseless, are hard to conclusively prove false. According to fact-checking groups, the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic were particularly rife with such claims, since there was almost no conclusive data about the disease, making it hard to find authoritative sources to dismiss appealing-sounding statements such as “Covid doesn’t spread as well in warm homes”. Fact-checkers who work on Facebook, the social network with the longest-running third-party fact-checking program, have a number of options beyond simply “true” and “false”. Posts can also be flagged as “altered”, “partly false”, “missing context” or “satire”. But unlike TikTok, the social network does not penalise posts for the absence of a “true” verification, except in certain situations where a post is highly viral and fact-checkers are actively working on uncovering the truth."
2021-02-04T11:00:33Z,technology,Technology,'It let white supremacists organize': the toxic legacy of Facebook's Groups,"Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO, announced last week the platform will no longer algorithmically recommend political groups to users in an attempt to “turn down the temperature” on online divisiveness. But experts say such policies are difficult to enforce, much less quantify, and the toxic legacy of the Groups feature and the algorithmic incentives promoting it will be difficult to erase. “This is like putting a Band-Aid on a gaping wound,” said Jessica J González, the co-founder of the anti-hate speech group Change the Terms. “It doesn’t do enough to combat the long history of abuse that’s been allowed to fester on Facebook.” Groups – a place to create ‘meaningful social infrastructure’ Facebook launched Groups, a feature that allows people with shared interests to communicate on closed forums, in 2010, but began to make a more concerted effort to promote the feature around 2017 after the Cambridge Analytica scandal cast a shadow on the platform’s Newsfeed. In a long blogpost in 2017 February called Building Global Community, Zuckerberg argued there was “a real opportunity” through groups to create “meaningful social infrastructure in our lives”.
He added: “More than one billion people are active members of Facebook groups, but most don’t seek out groups on their own – friends send invites or Facebook suggests them. If we can improve our suggestions and help connect one billion people with meaningful communities, that can strengthen our social fabric.” After growing its group suggestions and advertising the feature extensively – including during a 60-second spot in the 2020 Super Bowl – Facebook did see a rise in use. In February 2017 there were 100 million people on the platform who were in groups they considered “meaningful”. Today, that number is up to more than 600 million. That fast rise, however, came with little oversight and proved messy. In shifting its focus to Groups, Facebook began to rely more heavily on unpaid moderators to police hate speech on the platform. Groups proved a more private place to speak, for conspiracy theories to proliferate and for some users to organize real-life violence – all with little oversight from outside experts or moderators. Facebook in 2020 introduced a number of new rules to “keep Facebook groups safe”, including new consequences for individuals who violate rules and increased responsibility given to admins of groups to keep users in line. The company says it has hired 35,000 people to address safety on Facebook, including engineers, moderators and subject matter experts, and invested in AI technology to spot posts that violate it guidelines.
“We apply the same rules to Groups that we apply to every other form of content across the platform,” a Facebook company spokesperson said. “When we find Groups breaking our rules we take action – from reducing their reach to removing them from recommendations, to taking them down entirely. Over the years we have invested in new tools and AI to find and remove harmful content and developed new policies to combat threats and abuse.” Researchers have long complained that little is shared publicly regarding how, exactly, Facebook algorithms work, what is being shared privately on the platform, and what information Facebook collects on users. The increased popularity of Groups made it even more difficult to keep track of activity on the platform. “It is a black box,” said González regarding Facebook policy on Groups. “This is why many of us have been calling for years for greater transparency about their content moderation and enforcement standards. ” Meanwhile, the platform’s algorithmic recommendations sucked users further down the rabbit hole. Little is known about exactly how Facebook algorithms work, but it is clear the platform recommends users join similar groups to ones they are already in based on keywords and shared interests. Facebook’s own researchers found that “64% of all extremist group joins are due to our recommendation tools”, an internal report in 2016 found. “Facebook has let white supremacists organize and conspiracy theorists organize all over its platform and has failed to contain that problem,” González said. “In fact it has significantly contributed to the spread of that problem through its recommendation system.” ‘We need to do something to stop these conversations’ Facebook’s own research showed that algorithmic recommendations of groups may have contributed to the rise of violence and extremism. On Sunday, the Wall Street Journal reported that internal documents showed executives were aware of risks posed by groups and were warned repeatedly by researchers to address them. In one presentation in 2020 August, researchers said roughly “70% of the top 100 most active US Civic Groups are considered non-recommendable for issues such as hate, misinfo, bullying and harassment”. “We need to do something to stop these conversations from happening and growing as quickly as they do,” the researchers wrote, according to the Wall Street Journal, and suggested taking measures to slow the growth of Groups until more could be done to address the issues. Several months later, Facebook halted algorithmic recommendations for political groups ahead of the US elections – a move that has been extended indefinitely with the policy announced last week. The change seemed to be motivated by the 6 January insurrection, which the FBI found had been tied to organizing on Facebook. In response to the story in the Wall Street Journal, Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice-president of integrity, who oversees content moderation policies on the platform, said the problems were indicative of emerging threats rather than inability to address long-term problems. “If you’d have looked at Groups several years ago, you might not have seen the same set of behaviors,” he said.
But researchers say the use of Groups to organize and radicalize users is an old problem. Facebook groups had been tied to a number of harmful incidents and movements long before January’s violence. “Political groups on Facebook have always advantaged the fringe, and the outsiders,” said Joan Donovan, a lead researcher at Data and Society who studies the rise of hate speech on Facebook. “It’s really about reinforcement – the algorithm learns what you’ve clicked on and what you like and it tries to reinforce those behaviors. The groups become centers of coordination.” Facebook was criticized for its inability to police terror groups such as the Islamic State and al-Qaida using it as early as 2016. It was used extensively in organizing of the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville in 2019, where white nationalists and neo-Nazis violently marched. Militarized groups including Proud Boys, Boogaloo Bois and militia groups all organized, promoted and grew their ranks on Facebook. In 2020 officials arrested men who had planned a violent kidnapping of the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, on Facebook. A 17-year-old in Illinois shot three people, killing two, in a protest organized on Facebook. These same algorithms have allowed the anti-vaccine movement to thrive on Facebook, with hundreds of groups amassing hundreds of thousands of members over the years. A Guardian report in 2019 found the majority of search results for the term “vaccination” were anti-vaccine, led by two misinformation groups, “Stop Mandatory Vaccination” and “Vaccination Re-education Discussion Forum” with more than 140,000 members each. These groups were ultimately tied to harassment campaigns against doctors who support vaccines. In September 2020, Facebook stopped health groups from being algorithmically recommended to put a stop to such misinformation issues. It also has added other rules to stop the spread of misinformation, including banning users from creating a new group if an existing group they had administrated is banned. The origin of the QAnon movement has been traced to a post on a message board in 2017. By the time Facebook banned content related to the movement in 2020, a Guardian report had exposed that Facebook groups dedicated to the dangerous conspiracy theory QAnon were spreading on the platform at a rapid pace, with thousands of groups and millions of members. ‘The calm before the storm’ Zuckerberg has said in 2020 the company had removed more than 1m groups in the past year, but experts say the action coupled with the new policy on group recommendations are falling short. The platform promised to stop recommending political groups to users ahead of the elections in November and then victoriously claimed to have halved political group recommendations. But a report from the Markup showed that 12 groups among the top 100 groups recommended to users in its Citizen Browser project, which tracks links and group recommendations served to a nationwide panel of Facebook users, were political in nature. Indeed, the Stop the Steal groups that emerged to cast doubt on the results of the election and ultimately led to the 6 January violent insurrection amassed hundreds of thousands of followers – all while Facebook’s algorithmic recommendations of political groups were paused. Many researchers also worry that legitimate organizing groups will be swept up in Facebook’s actions against partisan political groups and extremism. “I don’t have a whole lot of confidence that they’re going to be able to actually sort out what a political group is or isn’t,” said Heidi Beirich, who is the co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism and sits on Facebook’s Real Oversight Board, a group of academics and watchdogs criticizing Facebook’s content moderation policies. “They have allowed QAnon, militias and other groups proliferate so long, remnants of these movements remain all over the platform,” she added. “I don’t think this is something they are going to be able to sort out overnight.” “It doesn’t actually take a mass movement, or a massive sea of bodies, to do the kind of work on the internet that allows for small groups to have an outsized impact on the public conversation,” added Donovan. “This is the calm before the storm.”"
2021-02-04T02:01:58Z,technology,Technology,Parler social network terminates CEO John Matze,"Parler, the social media platform favored by the US far right, has dismissed its CEO John Matze. Matze confirmed his termination in a text message to Reuters. “On January 29, 2021, the Parler board controlled by Rebekah Mercer decided to immediately terminate my position as CEO of Parler. I did not participate in this decision,” Matze said in a memo sent to Parler staff, originally reported by Fox News. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Parler, which was founded in 2018, has styled itself as a “free speech-driven” space. The platform saw rapid growth with conservative users who grew frustrated as more mainstream platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, increasingly cracked down on falsehoods and misinformation.
However the site is facing an uncertain future after being essentially forced offline after the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. Its website was subsequently dropped by Amazon’s cloud-hosting division, while Google and Apple had also suspended Parler from its app stores. The site has since partially returned online with the help of a Russian-owned technology company. Matze, who describes himself as libertarian, founded Parler as an alternative to mainstream platforms but began courting right-leaning users as prominent supporters of Donald Trump moved there. Senator Ted Cruz has promoted the app, while rightwing figures such as Laura Loomer, who had been banned from other platforms, found a haven there. The social network, which resembles Twitter, takes its name from the French verb meaning “to talk” but is often pronounced like the English word “parlor”. Parler says it has more than 10m users. This month, US lawmakers asked the FBI to investigated the role of Parler in facilitating and planning the attack on the US Capitol, citing reports that it was used to detail violent threats against elected officials."
2021-02-03T19:27:11Z,technology,Technology,What will Amazon founder Jeff Bezos do next?,"A quarter of a century after he founded Amazon in a Seattle garage, Jeff Bezos announced this week that he is preparing to loosen his grip on the $1.7tn (£1.2tn) company. The billionaire – who until he was recently overtaken by Tesla’s Elon Musk was the world’s richest person – will this summer pass the reins to top lieutenant Andy Jassy and Bezos will become executive chairman. Few employees in the sphere conservatories at Amazon’s sprawling Seattle campus headquarters reckon Bezos will relinquish much of his iron grip on the company’s day-to-day decision making. But Bezos, 57, told his 1.3 million employees (who he refers to as “fellow Amazonians”) that “as much as I still tap dance into the office, I’m excited about this transition”. “I’ve never had more energy, and this isn’t about retiring,” he said. “I intend to focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives … I’m super passionate about the impact I think these organisations can have.” Those organisations were: the Day One Fund; the Blue Origin space company; the Bezos Earth Fund; and the Washington Post newspaper. Here we look at what Bezos will do next with those interests. Day One Fund Bezos is unique among the world’s five wealthiest people as the only one not to have signed the Giving Pledge, a philanthropic initiative created by Bill Gates and investor Warren Buffett to encourage the world’s richest people to commit to giving at least half their wealth to charity. In 2018 he gave $2bn, amounting to just over 1% of his wealth, to the Bezos Day One Fund to help address homelessness and improve education for children in low-income families. Bezos said his decision to use the fund to support nonprofits that focus on homeless services was inspired by Mary’s Place, a Seattle-based organisation with a simple motto: “No child sleeps outside.” However, the charity has been criticised for only slowly ramping up its donations to good causes. Earlier this year it named 42 recipients from 24 states that will receive donations totalling $106m. Blue Origin
When attending high school near Miami, Bezos decided he wanted to go into space when he grew up. But, his ambition was not to be an astronaut; he wanted to colonise space. He was named valedictorian of his high school class and when he graduated in 1982, the Miami Herald asked for an interview. The 18-year-old Bezos told the paper he wanted to “build space hotels, amusement parks and colonies for 2 million or 3 million people who would be in orbit”. “The whole idea is to preserve the Earth,” he told the paper. “The goal was to be able to evacuate humans. The planet would become a park.” Now, Bezos owns Blue Origin a space company that aims to make space travel cheaper and slightly more accessible with reusable launch vehicles. The company, which uses the motto Gradatim Ferociter, Latin for “step by step, ferociously”, is testing a moon lander called Blue Moon and hopes to launch its first mission in 2024. In his race to commercialise space Bezos is competing against Musk’s SpaceX. Bezos Earth Fund Last year Bezos posted a picture of the Earth on Instagram, and announced the creation of his new project the Bezos Earth Fund, a $10bn initiative to support scientists, activists and charities working to tackle the climate crisis. “Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet,” he said. “I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share. This global initiative will fund scientists, activists, NGOs – any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world. We can save Earth. It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organisations, and individuals. ⁣⁣Earth is the one thing we all have in common – let’s protect it, together.⁣⁣⁣” In November he announced 16 initial recipients of the fund, who will receive a collective $791m. They include The Nature Conservancy, Natural Resources Defense Council, Environmental Defense Fund, World Resources Institute and the World Wildlife Fund, which will each receive $100 million. Bezos said, again on Instagram, that he had spent months learning about the grantees’ work and said they were all “working on innovative, ambitious and needle-moving solutions”. It is “just the beginning”, he added. The Washington Post
Bezos bought the Washington Post, famed the world over for its Watergate investigation that led to the resignation of Richard Nixon, in 2013 for $250m. He has been credited with bringing the paper into the digital era after decades of decline and concern about its future as a going concern. The Post was given prominent position on Amazon devices such as the Kindle. Reporters and editors who might have feared that Bezos would interfere with editorial decision-making, say that the billionaire has focused on the technology side of the business and has not used it to promote his own agenda. “I didn’t know anything about the newspaper business … But I did know something about the internet,” Bezos said in an interview soon after he took over. … and still at Amazon Those 1.3 million Amazonians should not think they’ve seen the last of their boss. Amazon’s chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky told reporters last night that: “Jeff is really not going anywhere. It’s more of a restructuring of who’s doing what.”"
2021-02-03T18:01:02Z,technology,Technology,‘A managerial Mephistopheles’: inside the mind of Jeff Bezos,"The first thing I ever bought on Amazon was an edutainment DVD for babies. I don’t recall making the purchase, but the data is unequivocal on this point: on 14 November 2004, I bought Baby Einstein: Baby Noah – Animal Expedition for the sum of £7.85. My nearest guess is that I got it as a Christmas present for my nephew, who would at that point have been one year old, and at the very peak of his interest in finger-puppet animals who cavort to xylophone arrangements of Beethoven. This was swiftly followed by three more DVD purchases I have no memory of making. Strangely, I bought nothing at all from Amazon the following year, and then, in 2006, I embarked on a PhD and started ramping up my acquisition of the sort of books that were not easily to be found in brick-and-mortar establishments. Dry treatises on psychoanalysis. Obscure narrative theory texts. The occasional poetry collection. Everything ever published by the American novelist Nicholson Baker. I know these things because I recently spent a desultory morning clicking through all 16 years of my Amazon purchase history. Seeing all those hundreds of items bought and delivered, many of them long since forgotten, was a vaguely melancholy experience. I experienced an estranged recognition, as if reading an avant-garde biography of myself, ghost-written by an algorithm. From the bare facts of the things I once bought, I began to reconstruct where I was in life, and what I was doing at the time, and what I was (or wanted to be) interested in. And yet an essential mystery endured. What kind of person purchases within the space of a few days, as I did in August of 2012, a Le Creuset non-stick crepe pan, three blue and white herringbone tea-towels, and a 700-odd page biography of the Marxist philosopher Theodor Adorno? (The tea-towels are still in use, and so is the crepe pan, while the 700-plus page Adorno biography remains, inevitably, unread.) Perhaps the answer is as simple as: a person with an Amazon account. My Amazon ordering peaked in 2018, a year in which I bought 92 books from the site. What strikes me as somewhat ironic now is how many of those books – bought from a company owned by a man who was, at that point, the richest person on Earth, and which is responsible for roughly the same annual carbon emissions as Norway – could be categorised under two major headings: anti-capitalism and climate change. There’s a good reason for this, or at any rate a clear one: I was at that point in the middle of researching a book about climate change, capitalism and apocalyptic anxieties. My point here is that my relationship with this company is an extremely vexed one. I think of myself as a socialist, but my purchase history leaves me no choice but to also think of myself as a loyal customer of Amazon.com.
The way that Amazon does business – its pressuring of suppliers, its systematic annihilation of retail competitors, its incessant harvesting of its customers’ data, its treatment of its own workers as little better than machines – is, of course, inseparable from the personal wealth of its founder, Jeff Bezos, who earlier this week stepped down as CEO of the company. But even if the means by which that wealth had been amassed were somehow unobjectionable, it would still stand, purely on its own terms, as a moral obscenity. It’s impossible to even conceive of the scale of this man’s wealth. It’s like trying to think about deep time: the mind’s eye glazes over. This is a man who makes about $149,000 with every passing minute. This is a man who, last July, in the midst of a global pandemic and a devastating economic crisis, increased his personal wealth by $13bn in the course of a single day. This is a man who, despite living on a planet where one third of human beings don’t have access to safe drinking water, told Business Insider magazine that “the only way I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel”. Some further perversities: I make my living mostly through my books, and I rely, as such, on the relative robustness of the transatlantic book business. Amazon has, by and large, been bad for people like me, because it has been bad for the industries we rely on – publishing and retail bookselling. If you buy my book from Amazon, I receive a lower royalty than I would if you bought it from the bookshop around the corner. Amazon does not abide by the recommended retail price you see on the back cover. Because of its overwhelming market power, it sets its own retail price, and demands lower cost prices from publishers, whose lower margins are reflected in the writer’s royalties. It doesn’t make sense for me as a writer to be as loyal a customer as I am of a company like Amazon. But here is where I encounter the problem of my own moral inertia. If a thing is available for purchase, and I want to buy it, I know for a near certainty that I will be able to get on Amazon, and that I will in all likelihood be able to get it quicker and cheaper than I would elsewhere. Just a moment ago, in fact, I got a notification on my phone – an email from Amazon informing me that a package I’d ordered had just been delivered. I went downstairs and opened the front door, and right there on the doorstep was a thin cardboard package, bearing the blandly smiling logo, and containing an illustrated book of Greek legends I’d ordered for my son a few days ago. I’d like to be able to tell you how much it would have cost me to get this book from another online seller, and how long it would have taken. But the truth is I don’t know, and I don’t know because it would have been a hassle to find out. A basically negligible hassle, maybe, but the point is that we live in a culture in which even negligible hassle amounts to a deal-breaker. It is a culture which Amazon helped to create and has come to exemplify, and of which I, as a consumer, am both beneficiary and product. Amazon has established itself as the great path of least resistance, encircling the globe, along which in one direction goods flow, and in the other money. Almost 40% of all online purchases in the US are made on Amazon. In the UK, it’s about 30%. There are many criticisms to be made about Amazon’s corporate practices, its insidious effects on multiple levels of the economy, but you can’t say that it is not efficient, or that its efficiency is not in your interest as a consumer. But I am not merely a consumer. There are times, in fact, when I can flatter myself into believing that I am not even primarily a consumer. I am also a person with political beliefs, and moral principles. There is a distinction between having those beliefs and principles and acting in a way that is consistent with them – and this distinction is, I think, crucial to understanding the meaning of Amazon. * * * What would it mean to resolve this contradiction – between my conception of myself as a person, and my Amazon purchase history? In one sense, it would be fairly easy. I could just stop arranging with Amazon.com for things to be sent to my house. It’s not like there aren’t plenty of other, less objectionable, places to buy books and other miscellaneous items online. I am, to be fair, struggling to think of another single retailer that would get me squared away with both the Adorno biography and the non-stick crepe pan, but the point is that I would in any case likely manage my consumer affairs just fine without Amazon. One of the advantages of the free market is that it will gladly accommodate your vague anti-capitalist preferences: there is no shortage of ethically palatable online retailers you can rely on, at least until Jeff Bezos finds out about them and acquires them. (I don’t want to throw myself entirely under the bus here, by the way: I try to buy from independent booksellers if it’s remotely convenient, and often enough when it’s not. I’m not going to pretend I don’t fall off the wagon, though.)
But the idea of “boycotting Amazon” arises out of a misreading of what Amazon actually is, and of its position in the contemporary marketplace. Amazon is not, and has not been for many years, merely a gigantic online shop that you can chose either to patronise or not. It is also, increasingly, the infrastructure undergirding the internet itself. Even if my task here was to convince you, the reader, that Amazon was bad and that you should boycott it – which we both know it is, and that you should – we would both of us still, in a strictly technical sense, be using Amazon. (Another, perhaps more accurate way of putting this would be to say that Amazon would still be using us.) Amazon Web Services (AWS), which launched in 2006 and is now the largest cloud computing platform in the world, provides hosting for the Guardian, and for tech mainstays such as Netflix and Twitter, as well as for industrial giants such as General Electric and Unilever. While researching this piece, I watched Amazon Empire: the Rise and Reign of Jeff Bezos, a highly informative – and highly critical – documentary, put out last year by the US non-profit public broadcaster PBS, which itself relies on Amazon’s cloud platform. In 2013, Amazon signed a $600m deal with the US government to host the top-secret workloads of its various intelligence agencies, including the CIA and NSA, via AWS’s Thomas Pynchon-ishly named Secret Region. Jeff Bezos’s achievement has been to make it less and less possible, or at least less and less practical, to avoid Amazon. It’s not an especially large overstatement to say that his ambition is to dominate the entire economy. (As the American journalist Franklin Foer put it, “if Marxist revolutionaries ever seized power in the United States, they could nationalize Amazon and call it a day”.) When Amazon acquired Whole Foods in 2017, for $13.7bn, the market value of the US’s largest grocery companies immediately plummeted by billions. The following year, when Amazon bought a small online pharmacy concern called PillPack for $753m, the potential effects on the traditional pharmacy sector spooked investors badly enough to cause a sudden and steep decline in the value of retail giants such as Walgreens, CVS and RiteAid. And when Amazon announced a healthcare partnership with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, aimed solely at providing coverage for these companies’ own employees, the major American health insurance providers instantaneously lost billions. How did Amazon come to occupy such an unprecedented role in contemporary life, and who is this extraordinary man who put it there? * * * One way to answer these questions would be to read that man’s collected writings – a thing that, against all expectations, turns out to actually exist. Last November, to very little fanfare, Harvard Business Review Press published a book called Invent & Wander: The Collected Writings of Jeff Bezos. Presumably by design, the title suggests an anthology of essays and intellectual interventions by a significant thinker, though in fact the first two-thirds of it is composed of Bezos’s annual letters to Amazon’s shareholders, with the final third, entitled My Life and Work, drawn from public talks and interview transcripts. As a writer who has felt on occasion the sting of the one-star Amazon review, I will admit to a certain low-grade schadenfreude on reading Bezos’s unsatisfied customers sounding off in the comments on his own website. “I can’t believe I paid for this,” writes one disgruntled reader. Another claims that the book could have been put together “by a 5 year old” – somewhat unfairly, it has to be said, because whatever you think of the book’s form, its content is predicated on its author having founded one of the most successful businesses in history. It’s true that the book is not exactly the collected essays of Montaigne, but if you want to understand Amazon’s dominance, it might be useful to first try to understand the man who started it, and his thinking about it, however banal that thinking might be. One thing I myself learned, for instance, was that before Bezos finally settled on Amazon as the name of his online store, he wanted to call it “Relentless”. Although friends eventually convinced him that he was erring on the side of the sinister, he did register the domain. Even now, if you type relentless.com into a browser, it will take you to Amazon. Despite those vaguely menacing associations – or, let’s be honest here, largely because of them – the name does capture some essential quality of the enterprise. Amazon is nothing if not relentless: in its incursion into the further reaches of the market, in its revenue growth, and in its ever-increasing presence in the everyday lives of its customers.
It’s certainly a word Bezos himself likes the sound of. It occurs a total of 17 times in the book. We get references to, among many others, “relentlessly lowering prices”, focusing “relentlessly on our customers”, and “relentless commitment to long-term shareholder values”. And relentlessness is not merely a corporate value Bezos aims to instil in his own business; he also wants to empower others to be relentless in their own right. In his 2010 address to Princeton’s graduates, Bezos puts the following question to the emerging members of the US ruling class: “When it’s tough, will you give up, or will you be relentless?” Relentlessness, in other words, transcends the category of mere corporate value, to become a kind of moral imperative. And if relentlessness is a good in itself, what might the evil of relenting look like? It might take the form of stasis, which, as we will see, is the great future nightmare that Bezos wants humanity to avoid at all costs. Amazon has never paid its shareholders a dividend. For most of its history, it never turned a profit, its practice being to plough everything into growth. The company is, in this sense, a rarified example of capitalism in its ideal form: not merely premised on the notion of endless growth, but apparently achieving it. And what is it all for, this personal empire whose vastness and multifariousness is unprecedented in the history of capitalism? Is it just wealth, just power, just control? No, of course not. If you know anything about Silicon Valley techno-capitalism, the first thing you know is that it’s never about mere wealth, mere market domination. Such things are always a means toward an end – and the end, more often than not, is saving the world. * * * Every year, Bezos liquidates a billion dollars’ worth of his own Amazon stock, and puts it into a company he founded in 2000 called Blue Origin, which develops technologies aimed at facilitating travel to, and settlement of, manmade colonies in outer space. “We want to go to space to protect this planet,” as he put it in a 2019 speech, included in Invent & Wander under the title The Purpose of Going into Space. The big problem the Earth faces, according to Bezos, is not environmental destruction per se; it’s the prospect of running out of energy resources. But if we move into outer space, he argues, we will have access to unlimited resources, and there will be, to all intents and purposes, no limits to growth, or to the consumption of energy. “In a nutshell,” as Fortune journalist Brian Dumaine puts it in his book Bezonomics, “he wants to make Earth a residential and light industrial zone and move all the mining and heavy industry to space.” “We could have a trillion humans in the solar system,” says Bezos, “which means we’d have a thousand Mozarts and a thousand Einsteins. This would be an incredible civilisation.” It’s worth wondering whether there might not already be thousands of Einsteins and Mozarts on this planet right now, and how many of them, due to accidents of birth and economic circumstance, are forced to expend their time and potential working as Amazon stockpickers or delivery drivers, further enriching Jeff Bezos – who would, if he were really as interested in cultivating human potential as he claims to be, probably pay people more, and let them take toilet breaks whenever they needed to. What Bezos is proposing is a system of off-world colonies, located close to Earth, on which millions of people will be able to live out lives of pleasure and comfort. There’s a video of him giving this speech, and the presentation is complemented by a series of animated fantasias of what these colonies would look like: incredibly lavish illustrations of manufactured worlds rotating in space to create centrifugal gravity. Some of these colonies, Bezos says, could replicate existing Earth cities – and here we see an illustration of Florence, complete with geo-engineered Arne and Tuscan hills, entubed and adrift in space. These worlds, says Bezos, would not all have to have the same level of gravity. “You could have a recreational colony,” he says, “that kept zero G so you could go flying with your own wings.” And there would, in such places, be ideal climates. “This is Maui on its best day all year long – no rain, no storms, no earthquakes.”
If these slowly rotating promised lands – with their perpetual shirt-sleeve climates, their low-gravity environments, their multitudinous Einsteins and Mozarts – are a kind of techno-capitalist Eden, then Bezos himself must be a benevolent god. But he’s not, to be clear, proposing that he construct these colonies himself: that will be the work of today’s children, and their children, and their grandchildren after them. What he is intending, with Blue Origin, is to provide the basic infrastructure for that building, in much the same way as pre-existing structures – state postal services, credit cards, the internet itself – allowed him to build Amazon. What he wants to do, he says, is not to build but “inspire” this future. Last year, Bezos announced a combined donation of nearly $800m to various organisations working to fight climate change. But if the writings in Invent & Wander are any guide, he seems less interested in climate change per se than he is in the extent to which it would present a threat to resource consumption, and economic growth. It is, in other words, as though Bezos is surveying the prospect of a dying planet – of mass extinction, burning forests, drowning cities – and seeing the problems it could present for online shopping. “What happens,” Bezos asks, “when unlimited demand meets finite resources? The answer is incredibly simple: rationing. That’s the path we would find ourselves on, and that path would lead, for the first time, to your grandchildren and their grandchildren having worse lives than you. That’s a bad path.” A world in which consumer goods are rationed is not a world in which Amazon could continue its endless growth. We must follow, in other words, the path of relentlessness, and we must follow it off the face of the Earth. It’s here that “relentlessness” is revealed as an ideological term. Bezos seems less interested in protecting the future of the planet than protecting the future of capitalism. * * * What are we to make of these celestial aspirations, this vision of the good life as one of endless consumption, limitless growth? And what, more to the point, are we to make of Bezos himself? In one sense, it’s hard to make anything of him at all. Despite his vertiginous wealth, and despite the extent to which his business interests have been skilfully woven into the fabric of our everyday lives, it’s weirdly hard to form any strong opinions about the man. He repels curiosity. The mind skitters off the beige gleam of his surfaces; the imagination scrabbles in vain for some purchase on the frictionless dome of his head. Two years ago, when Bezos’s texts to his former lover Lauren Sanchez were leaked to the National Enquirer, the most remarkable thing about them was their blank efficiency, as of a customer service chatbot made flesh. “I love you, alive girl,” he wrote. “I will show you with my body, and my lips and my eyes, very soon.” And also: “I want to talk to you and plan with you. Listen and laugh…I basically WANT TO BE WITH YOU!!! Then I want to fall asleep with you and wake up tomorrow and read the paper with you and have coffee with you.” Even the outline of his spacefaring fantasies seems bland and unoriginal, a reheated mid-20th century vision of the future – no more ingenious, in the end, than Amazon.com itself, which for all its world-straddling success began as (and essentially remains) a Walmart you can go to on the computer. But Bezos himself, like seemingly all wealthy entrepreneurs, claims not to be motivated by – or even especially interested in – wealth itself, or its mundane trappings. As he puts it in Invent & Wander, he never sought the title of “world’s richest man”. (Bezos is now, in fact, the world’s second richest person, having been overtaken just last month by Elon Musk.) He would much rather be known, he says, as “inventor Jeff Bezos” (my emphasis). In the statement he made to investors earlier this week on stepping down as chief executive, Bezos once more returned to the idea of himself as an inventor: “Amazon is what it is,” he said, “because of invention … When you look at our financial results, what you’re actually seeing are the long-run cumulative results of invention.” The book, and in particular its introduction, by the biographer Walter Isaacson, who is best known for his book about Steve Jobs, is intent on framing Bezos as a contemporary renaissance man, a figure on the revolutionary order of your Leonardos, your Einsteins, your Ben Franklins (all of whom Isaacson has written books about). After running through the qualities he considers peculiar to such “true innovators” – passionate curiosity, an equal love of both the arts and the sciences, a Jobs-like “reality distortion field” that inspires people to pursue apparently impossible ends, and a childlike sense of wonder – Isaacson concludes that Bezos embodies all of them, and that he belongs in the pantheon of truly revolutionary thinkers.
If you believe that capitalism is an inherently just and meritocratic system, whereby the most worthy people – the hardest-working, the cleverest, the most innovative – amass the greatest wealth, then it stands to reason that you would have to make some kind of argument for a man who had amassed more than $180bn in personal wealth as a presiding genius of our time. And just as Hegel looked at Napoleon and saw the world-soul on horseback, Isaacson views Bezos in similarly heroic light: the world-soul dispatched by delivery drone. The effort to portray him as such is, though, inevitably beset by bathos. “An example of how Bezos innovates and operates,” he writes, “was the launch of Amazon Prime, which transformed the way Americans think about how quickly and cheaply they can be gratified by ordering online.” There is no question that the introduction of Amazon Prime marked a major moment in the history of buying stuff off the internet, but to present it as the work of an ingenious inventor seems a stretch. For all the vastness of Bezos’s wealth and power, the banality of its foundation is undeniable. (There is, here, an unintended comedy to Isaacson’s hagiography, taking on as it does an almost mock-heroic tone: Bezos fomenting a kind of revolution in consciousness, around how “quickly and cheaply” consumers can get the stuff they order off the internet.) Bezos has not been personally responsible for the introduction of any new technology into the world. He was not the inventor of online shopping. The year before Amazon.com was founded, the first consumer purchase was made on the world wide web: a copy of Sting’s album Ten Summoner’s Tales, purchased for $12.48 plus shipping, from an online store called NetMarket. Neither did he, or any of his employees, invent the e-reader: a company called Rocket was selling e-readers through Barnes and Noble in the late 90s, back when Bezos was still packing boxes with his own hands. But it would clearly be wrong to claim that there is nothing radical about the nature of Bezos’s achievement. Amazon’s vast logistical innovations have made the consumer experience, from order to delivery, as frictionless as possible, and in so doing have changed the nature of consumerism. This is to say that it has changed the texture of the world. It’s not that Bezos is doing any one thing that no one had thought to do before: it’s that he’s doing it faster, more efficiently, and at unprecedented scale. His achievement, in this sense, can be seen as one not one of quality but of quantity. But the sheer scale of the quantity, the unprecedented mass and velocity of Amazon’s power, becomes itself qualitative – in the way that getting stung by two bees is quantitatively different from getting stung by one, but getting stung by a billion would be qualitatively different. * * * In his first ever annual shareholder letter, in 1997, Bezos laid out the principles that he felt defined the company he had taken public earlier that year. First and foremost among these was “Obsess over customers”. The expression used to denote the company’s drive to perfect the consumer experience at every stage was “customer ecstasy”. The phrase sounds a bizarre note, and even a vaguely obscene one, but there is no question that there is a joyfulness to the experience of ordering something online and having it arrive the very next day. It feels as though you have been granted a kind of magical power, to summon the objects of your desires out of thin air. This is the precise feeling, no doubt, that Bezos wanted to invoke with the first name he had in mind for his company. Before he registered relentless.com, he intended to go with Cadabra, which he favoured for its magical associations. He eventually cooled on the idea, though, when his lawyer pointed out that, spoken aloud, the name sounded too much like the word “cadaver”. Let us pause here to appreciate the comic symbolism of Bezos’s inability to come up with a name for his company that doesn’t immediately suggest some dark unconscious content to its openly stated proposition. It’s as though the magical power Amazon grants to you, the customer, entails a kind of Faustian bargain whereby you must implicitly consent to all kinds of iniquities being carried out in your name. When I think about this, I often think about an object that never came to exist. In 2016, Amazon was granted a patent for a “Human Transport Device”. The drawings that accompany the patent document depict a cage just large enough to contain one worker. The cage is mounted on a set of robotically controlled wheels, and features a long robotic arm with which the worker can carry out stock-picking tasks; the intention was to permit workers to enter into areas of warehouses where they would otherwise be endangered by the presence of the stock-picking robots by which they will, eventually, be replaced, and who in the meantime present a threat to their frail human bodies. The patent went unremarked for two years until the academics Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler discovered it, and wrote about it in a document that accompanied a work (part research project, part art installation) entitled Anatomy of an AI System – a sprawling diagram, two metres high and five metres across, mapping the complex nexus of extractive and exploitative processes involved in the functioning of an Amazon Echo. The patent, they write, “represents an extraordinary illustration of worker alienation, a stark moment in the relationship between humans and machines … Here, the worker becomes a part of a machinic ballet, held upright in a cage which dictates and constrains their movement.” Amazon never put the cage into production; when the patent was uncovered, the public reaction was one of horror, and the company acknowledged the whole thing as a terrible idea. But in its ghostly absence, this structure exemplifies the deal with the devil that you, the customer, enter into every time you click the “Buy Now” button. The true source of your magical power, its true cost, is the life of a worker labouring under deepening conditions of exploitation and control. Stockpickers at Amazon’s warehouses are surveilled and controlled to an extraordinary degree – handheld devices direct their movements, measure their productivity, and record the speed and efficiency with which they meet algorithmically set targets. At a warehouse in Staffordshire, workers were reported to be urinating in bottles because walking to the toilet and back could have led to them missing productivity targets, and ultimately losing their jobs. (In response to these reports, Amazon said that “we don’t recognize these allegations as an accurate portrayal of activities in our buildings”.) Since the pandemic, there have been numerous reports, and video recordings, of Amazon drivers relieving themselves in public. (“The disgusting moment Amazon delivery driver is caught on CCTV ‘doing a poo’ outside customer’s home after dropping off parcel,” read the headline of an article in the Manchester Evening News, which didn’t so much as gesture to the working conditions that might have contributed to this.) The cage suggests a way of thinking about what distinguishes Amazon as a business, and Bezos as an innovator: the use of technology to push harder and farther than any previous company toward removing, at both ends of the supply chain, the human limitations to capital’s efficiency. Amazon reveals a world, that is, where capital is not something to be acquired in service of human ends, but as an end in itself. If other worlds must be constructed, slowly rotating in space, in order to serve these post-human ends, then so be it. The problem with the cage patent, in other words, was not just that it was dehumanising, but that it illustrated too explicitly the patterns of dehumanisation – of relentlessness in pursuit of customer ecstasy – that had already long been central to Amazon’s operations in the first place.
It’s tempting to argue that Amazon’s true innovation has been the ruthless exploitation of human labour in service of speed and efficiency, but that’s really only part of the picture: the aim is removing humans – with their need for toilet breaks, their stubborn insistence on sleeping, their tendency to unionise – as much as possible from the equation; the grim specifics of the labour conditions are only ever a byproduct of that aim. This has been an aim of capitalism since at least as far back as Henry Ford, and in an obvious sense it’s precisely the dynamic you experience every time you wind up with unexpected items in the bagging area at Tesco. As usual with Amazon, it’s not that something new is happening – it’s that an old thing is happening with unprecedented force, speed and efficiency. To look at Crawford and Joler’s sprawling infographic is to experience a peculiar moral disorientation. They map a system that is, ultimately, too vast for comprehension, and within which your own position, as a consumer, is endlessly ambiguous. You – which is to say your customer ecstasy – are both the reason for its existence, and just another resource to be extracted for value, along with the the minerals being mined by people suffering under terrible labour conditions. Every time you interact with your Echo you are training the AI to work better, and to understand more about you, your habits and desires, which extracted data it uses to more efficiently sell you things. With an AI product like Amazon’s Echo, you are not just a consumer: you are also both a resource and an unpaid worker, providing information and training to a dynamic system based on feedback loops of data. * * * The problem here is the same sort of problem we are confronted with when attempting to think about the scale of Bezos’s wealth, or indeed Bezos himself: the mind struggles to gain purchase. One approach would be to just tap the sign that says “No Ethical Consumption Under Capitalism”, because the entire system within which we live is so morally bankrupt that no kind of decent accommodation with it can be reached – which would not be untrue, but also unquestionably something of a cop-out. It’s precisely because it works so well, as a consumer experience, that Amazon’s customers are inclined to keep using it, even though many of us understand the social evils it represents. There is, in other words, a system of moral feedback loops at work here, as complex and insidious as the data feedback loops that nurture Amazon’s AI. It’s also worth pointing out that there is always some marginally – or even greatly – less unethical consumer choice to be made, even under capitalism. The reality is that so few of them work as well as Amazon. And here we come to the core of the problem: Amazon works too well. Its success and ubiquity as a consumer phenomenon makes a mockery of my ethical objections to its existence. (When I think of these objections, I imagine Bezos literally mocking me, laughing his famously weird, raptor’s laugh. “I don’t know why I have this laugh,” he writes, somewhat unsettlingly, in Invent & Wander. “It’s just that I laugh easily and often.”) Amazon thrusts my identity as a consumer into open conflict with my other identities – writer of books, holder of vaguely socialist ideals – in such a way that my consumer identity too often prevails. We live in a world where the satisfaction of quotidian desires is the work of mere moments. Whatever you want (and can afford) can be brought to you, cheaply and with vanishingly minimal effort on your part. We know that this form of satisfaction doesn’t make us any happier, and in fact only damages the world we live in, but even so we continue pursuing it – perhaps because it’s in our nature, or perhaps because almost every element of the culture we exist in is calibrated to make us do so. And so the problem, as such, is one of desire. It’s not that Amazon gives me what I want; it’s that it gives me what I don’t want to want. I want the convenience and speed and efficiency that Amazon offers, but I’d rather not want it if it entails all the bad things that go with it. To put it in Freudian terms, we are talking about the triumph of the consumerist id over the ethical superego. Bezos is a kind of managerial Mephistopheles for our time, who will guarantee you a life of worldly customer ecstasy as long as you avert your eyes from the iniquities being carried out in your name. It is hard to recognise the Faustian nature of this bargain, just as it is hard to see clearly what Jeff Bezos is. In Isaacson’s introduction to Invent & Wander, he mentions a detail from Bezos’s childhood – no more or less banal than any other story I’ve encountered about the man – by way of explaining the origin of Amazon’s Echo. He loved Star Trek, and played a lot of Star Trek games with his friends as a kid. And the role he himself tended to play in these games was not Kirk, or Scotty, or even Spock. It was the Enterprise’s talking computer. In this detail of the childhood play of a man who would go on to change the world, we can glimpse something of the meaning of his presence in our lives. Bezos’s genius, such as it is, is that of an artificial intelligence, trained on the goals of endless wealth, and endless growth. And if he is, as Isaacson – and presumably Bezos himself – would like us to believe, a Leonardo or an Einstein of our time, what does that say about our time? In his second shareholder letter, in 1998, included in the book as “Obsessions”, Bezos laid out the fundamental idea that underpinned Amazon’s drive to build the world’s most “customer-centric company.” “We hold as axiomatic,” he wrote, “that customers are perceptive and smart, and that brand image follows reality and not the other way around.” Intentionally or otherwise, the grandiloquence of the language here recalls the US Declaration of Independence: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” The bathos of Bezos’s allusion here – the vertiginous swoop from the rhetorical heights of “We hold as axiomatic” to the mundane invocation of savvy customers – tells us, I think, something profound about the world over which he now presides.
Hypocrites and slave-owners though most of the Declaration’s signatories were, their language invokes an Enlightenment ideal of human beings as free and equal, and life itself as inherently meaningful. There is, by contrast, an almost comical smallness to Bezos’s echoing of that language, and the worldview it reveals. There is no “humanity” being invoked here, no “all men”; there is only “the customer”. There is no grander ideal to be glimpsed behind his words than that of being able to get stuff quickly and cheaply. There is no question that Amazon serves us. The fact that it serves us so well is the reason for its incredible success. But what it serves in us is something very small: the customer, who for all that smartness and perceptiveness Bezos invokes, is a mere husk of a human being. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, sign up to the long read weekly email here, and find our podcasts here"
2021-02-03T17:38:38Z,technology,Technology,Amazon reports UK sales rose by 51% in 2020,"Amazon’s UK sales soared by 51% last year to a record $26.5bn (£19.4bn) as people trapped at home due to the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns turned to the internet retailing giant to buy items unavailable in closed high street stores and to keep them entertained. While Amazon celebrated the rise in revenue collected from UK customers, the company did not state how much tax it paid in the UK last year. The company, which has made its founder and outgoing chief executive Jeff Bezos a $200bn fortune, paid just £293m in tax in 2019 despite the company collecting UK sales of $17.5bn that year. Details of the leap in Amazon’s sales in the UK were contained in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US after the tech company unveiled its latest global financial results on Wednesday night. They revealed that Amazon’s global revenue soared past $100bn in the most recent three months. Bezos also announced he was stepping down from the day-to-day running of the comany and handing the reins to one of his key lieutenants, Andy Jassy. The £19.5bn that UK customers spent at Amazon in 2020 is roughly double the takings at Marks & Spencer, the 137-year-old retailer, and underlines how the Covid-19 pandemic is revolutionising the way we shop and threatening the future of the high street. Paul Monaghan, chief executive of Fair Tax Mark, said it was very unlikely that the 50% jump in Amazon’s UK sales would lead to any sizeable increase in UK tax paid because “a good proportion of [Amazon’s UK sales] will be booked in Luxembourg, where they engineered a near €1bn (£880m) loss last year”. He said the result of this financial engineering would lead to Amazon “racking up hundreds of millions of tax credits that will be used in the future to offset future profits that might have otherwise generated tax contributions”. Last year, it emerged that Amazon received €294m in tax credits across Europe in 2019. Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP who has long campaigned against tax avoidance, said Amazon used “complex corporate structures designed solely for the purpose of avoiding tax” and said it was “about time Amazon buck up its ideas and starts contributing fairly”. ‘These figures demonstrate how Amazon has benefited massively under the pandemic as consumers have switched to shopping online,” Hodge said. “All the while the UK’s well-loved shops and high streets are seriously struggling. “The government must urgently figure out how we can properly tax Amazon and the other tech giants.” Tax transparency campaigners have accused Amazon of “aggressively avoiding” tens of billions of tax due to governments across the world by shifting its profits through low tax jurisdictions, such as Luxembourg. Monaghan said Amazon’s annual results indicate that the company has “tax avoidance baked into its business model”. “Their tax contribution continues to be miserly once you analyse the cash payments that are actually handed over to government,” Monaghan said. “In 2020, their corporation tax contribution across the world was just 7%, which is down even on the 11% they paid through the preceding decade.” Amazon is not alone in creating complex corporate structures to avoid tax. The big six US tech firms – Amazon, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Apple and Microsoft – have been accused of avoiding $100bn (£75bn) of global tax over the past decade. The UK government has tried to clamp down on multinational tech companies avoiding tax by the creation of a 2% digital services tax, but Amazon will not have to pay the tax on products it sells directly to consumers. The company has already stated that the 2% tax on revenues made in the UK will be passed on to sellers. After a public and political outcry over its failure pay the appropriate amount of tax, Amazon said in 2015 it would stop using corporate structures that diverted sales and profits away from the UK. A spokesperson for Amazon said: “We are investing heavily in creating jobs and infrastructure across the UK – more than £23bn since 2010. The UK has now become one of Amazon’s largest global hubs for talent and last year we announced plans to create 10,000 new jobs in the country by the end of 2020, taking our total workforce to over 40,000. “This continued investment helped contribute to a total tax contribution of £1.1 billion during 2019 – £293m in direct taxes and £854m in indirect taxes.”"
2021-02-03T17:29:22Z,technology,Technology,Spotify credits podcast popularity for 24% growth in subscribers,"Spotify recorded a doubling in podcast listening hours in the fourth quarter of 2020, as locked-down listeners hunting for entertainment tuned in to Michelle Obama and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, driving a Wall Street-beating 24% year-on-year increase in paying subscribers. The audio streaming company, which now has 155 million paying customers, saw its total monthly user base, including those on its free, advertising-supported tier, grow 27% year-on-year to 345 million. A quarter of all users engaged with podcast content in the final three months of 2020 in what Spotify sees as validation of its decision to spend millions on a roster of new talent in a strategic shift beyond music. “We are confident that podcast usage has been a factor in the accelerated net additions,” said Daniel Ek, founder and chief executive of Spotify, in a letter to shareholders. “We have increasing conviction in the causal relationship between growth in podcast consumption driving higher [value] and retention among our user base.” The number of podcasts offered has more than tripled in a year, from 700,000 in the final quarter of 2019 to 2.2m at the end of 2020, with deals now in place with a huge range of presenters. In December, Spotify announced a multi-year partnership with the Sussex’s company, Archewell Audio. The company said it was “pleased” with the performance of its holiday special, released in December, and is looking forward to a “full-scale launch of shows coming in 2021”. Obama’s interviews with family and friends have been pulling in listeners, while the Joe Rogan Experience, which has controversially featured the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, is Spotify’s No 1 podcast in 17 territories since becoming exclusive late last year.
Spotify’s podcasting strategy helped it outperform expectations of advertising income, which grew 29% year-on-year to €281m, as advertiser demand continues to bounce back after contracting at the start of the pandemic. Ad revenues related to its podcasts grew by more than 100% year-on-year, with a 50% increase in the number of advertisers compared with the third quarter. Advertising now contributes a meaningful share of total revenues, accounting for 13% in the fourth quarter.
The main driver of the business continues to be subscriptions, up 15% year-on-year to 1.89bn. Total revenues grew 17% year-on-year to €2.17bn. Despite attracting a record 31 million new paying subscribers last year, Spotify’s share price fell 8% as the market reacted to lower-than-expected forecasts for growth in 2021. Spotify expects to reach as many as 427 million monthly active users and 184 million paid subscribers this year. It ventured into podcasting in 2019, spending hundreds of millions acquiring companies in the sector and striking talent deals, to reduce its dependence on music in the face of rising competition from rival services including Apple and Amazon Music."
2021-02-03T16:47:57Z,technology,Technology,Bezos leaves Amazon in its prime – keeping it that way is the task,"A pain-free departure of a visionary founder is a difficult trick to pull off for any business. The stakes are even higher for a company the size of Amazon, as Jeff Bezos steps back from his day-to-day management role. The decision by Bezos, 57, to quit as chief executive later this year took analysts by surprise, but the first step has already gone smoothly, with Andy Jassy appointed as his successor without any public power struggle. It is, on the face of it, an auspicious time for a new chief executive. Amazon also reported another round of record results, with profits of $24bn (£17.6bn) during 2020 pumped up by housebound customers during the pandemic. Yet the company’s scale and reach means Jassy will face several significant challenges when he takes the reins.
In its core retail business Amazon has a dominant position, but Jassy will now oversee its push into businesses with stricter regulation, such as prescription medicines. Amazon is also targeting fresh food, where deep-pocketed incumbents will not willingly give up their customers. And the upheaval in retail is by no means over. Amazon’s investments in technologies such as autonomous drone delivery and shops without tills show it is alert to threats, but new business models could pop up, particularly from rivals in China, that could dent growth. Growth in its main markets could also become moredifficult, forcing Amazon to spend moreto retain customer loyalty, such as going up against Netflix and Apple on expensive film and television production to feed its Prime Video service. There are other, more controversial issues that Jassymust grasp. Amazon still relies on an army of low-paid workers and has faced repeated criticism from workers who have felt inadequately protected during the Covid-19 pandemic, and over the firm’s continued opposition to unionisation. Amazon has already faced scrutiny from regulators in Europe and the US, particularly focused on the potential conflict between its role as a platform for smaller retailers and as a retailer itself. The European commission has already found evidence that Amazon used non-public data from its sellers to its advantage. Further evidence of abuses could cause serious headaches for Jassy. In the longer term the new boss faces a problem of his own making. Jassy, who joined Amazon in 1997, was a technical adviser to Bezos when two engineers suggested the company sell the web hosting technology it had built to other businesses. Under Jassy’s leadership Amazon Web Services (AWS) expanded to provide operating income of $13.5bn last year – well over half the group’s total. That success has led some analysts to question whether AWS should be a standalone company, able to spend the cash it generates on more profitable ventures than subsidising the retail business. Those voices could be emboldened by a new chief executive."
2021-02-03T10:00:03Z,technology,Technology,Amazon intensifies 'severe' effort to discourage first-ever US warehouse union,"A push to unionize workers at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama is running into tough opposition as the retail giant, whose profits have boomed during the coronavirus pandemic despite concerns over worker safety, has launched an aggressive anti-union drive.
If workers at the BHM1 warehouse in Bessemer, near Birmingham, succeed in their efforts they would form the first union at an Amazon warehouse in the US. The warehouse opened in March 2020, during the beginning of the pandemic. By the end of 2020, the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union said over 2,000 workers at the warehouse signed union authorization cards ahead of the election workers filed for in November 2020. Ballots for the election are scheduled to be mailed out to about 5,800 Amazon workers on 8 February, with vote-counting scheduled for 30 March 2021. Lawyers for Amazon are currently trying to appeal against the decision to allow the election to be carried out by mail, and have requested the election be delayed until their appeal is reviewed. Ahead of the union election, Amazon has strongly encouraged workers to vote against the union through texts, messaging, an anti-union website and several anti-union captive audience meetings with workers at the warehouse. In the texts, Amazon claims workers will “be giving up your right to speak for yourself” by signing a union authorization card and emphasizing union dues, claiming “unions are a business,” telling workers “don’t let the union take your money for nothing” and prompting them to visit their anti-union website DoItWithoutDues.com. Amazon has also sponsored ads on Facebook featuring their anti-union website and telling workers to vote “no” in the union election. “When it comes to this union busting, it’s severe. We’ve never seen anything like it on this level,” said Joshua Brewer, an organizer with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. “This is something that has always been and will continue to always be the people of Bessemer, the workers at Amazon coming together. This was theirs, and will always be theirs,” Brewer added. Amazon’s sales and profits have boomed during the pandemic and its outgoing CEO and founder, Jeff Bezos, added more than $70bn to his net worth during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, which is now nearly $185bn. But the company has also faced criticism for safety concerns in its warehouses. Brewer explained some of the reasons workers have cited as wanting to form a union, with the primary one being the lack of communication between workers and managers within the warehouse as disciplinary measures are often carried out by an app, making it difficult for workers to appeal write-ups, terminations or address grievances in the workplace. Una Massey, a former level five area manager at BHM1, affirmed the lack of communication, disorganization, and mistreatment of workers at the warehouse. She worked at Amazon for over four years before she was terminated in August 2020 after she claims she made several complaints about discrimination and harassment against her and other female managers from men in management, all of which were ignored. It was her fourth warehouse launch with Amazon since starting with the company at the age of 18. When she was first offered the position, she was told the warehouse was having trouble gathering enough experienced managers to launch the warehouse. She was excited to start, especially because the group of managers were predominantly African American like herself and she never had the opportunity to work in that environment, but that veneer quickly faded among red flags she saw throughout the launch process. She noted the lack of experienced managers helped create the conditions in which workers at the warehouse are now seeking to form a union. “I feel like the reason why BHM1 is in a situation right now with it going to vote to become unionized is the lack of experienced managers that they had,” she said. “A majority of those leaders were external hires, meaning they were either college graduates or had been something similar to managers in other companies.” She cited a lack of communication in quickly changing company policies during the first few months of the launch as putting Amazon workers at significant risk of job security and safety. During the first few months of the pandemic, when the warehouse in Alabama opened, Amazon workers were allowed to keep their cellphones on them during work hours in case of emergency, but when that policy was revoked and implemented with zero tolerance, it was only communicated on employees’ screens. “Instead of giving a transitional period for the associates for them to get used to this new rule, they went immediately just to say that if they were seen with it, it’s their fault, and it was going to be a final warning,” Massey said. “That they would be so callous as to just have something as simple as having your phone out.” The same issue occurred when Amazon’s unlimited unpaid time-off policy ended during the pandemic in July, explained Massey, which was enacted abruptly in the new warehouse, leaving workers who went in the negative subject to termination. Because of these policies, Massey said attrition rates soared and a lot of time went into having to train new hires. She noted that she and other managers spoke up about the lack of communication and against the policies, but were ignored. As staffing became an issue, she added, safety protections were shoved aside. “If we were short-staffed in an area, they would move an associate there to continue on without going through the proper training or safety protocols,” Massey said. The lines were also designed in a way where six feet of social distancing was impossible for workers to practice while working, but Amazon still used a team called “Space Force” to enforce social distancing during lunches, clock-ins and clock-outs, writing up workers who did not follow protocols even though there wasn’t enough space for them to do so. “They started giving associates final warning for breaking social distancing, meaning that if associates were seen within six feet of each other, they were given that final pink slip. But that was so unfair to the associates, because there weren’t even enough seats in the lunchroom,” Massey added. Amazon did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Massey’s termination or characterizations of the work environment at BHM1. In regards to the union drive, an Amazon spokeswoman, Heather Knox, said in an email, “We respect our employees’ right to join or not join a labor union but we don’t believe this group represents the majority of our employees’ views. Our employees choose to work at Amazon because we offer some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire, and we encourage anyone to compare our overall pay, benefits, and workplace environment to any other company with similar jobs.”"
2021-02-03T00:29:18Z,technology,Technology,Who is Andy Jassy? Amazon’s new CEO ushered in the era of cloud computing,"Amazon on Tuesday said its billionaire founder, Jeff Bezos, would step down as chief executive officer and become executive chairman after nearly 30 years at the company. The transition will promote the company’s current cloud computing head, Andy Jassy, to the next chief executive of the company, as Bezos hands over the reins for the first time since he founded Amazon and oversaw its evolution from small online bookstore to ubiquitous retail juggernaut. Jassy, 52, joined Amazon in 1997 after Harvard Business School. “I took my last final exam at HBS, the first Friday of May in 1997, and I started Amazon next Monday,” Jassy said in a Harvard Business School podcast in September. “No, I didn’t know what my job was going to be, or what my title was going to be.” Jassy went on to found Amazon Web Services, according to the company’s website, a cloud hosting product that creates the infrastructure used by millions of companies, schools, and governments to run websites and apps.
In the years since, AWS has grown into a cloud platform used by millions that dominates legacy players like Oracle and Microsoft. The company now owns almost half the world’s public cloud infrastructure market. It boasts a dominant 30% market share of the cloud computing market. Competitors are eyeing Amazon’s top spot, however, with Microsoft and Google announcing growth in their cloud computing businesses in the fourth quarter. His promotion underscored the importance of web services to Amazon’s future, said Tom Johnson, chief transformation officer at Mindshare Worldwide. “Jassy’s background in steering AWS shows just how top-of-mind those services are to Amazon’s business strategy,” Johnson said. “It will be interesting to see how that affects their strategy and balancing that priority with a growing ad business and the commerce behemoth.” Bezos said in a letter to staff on Tuesday that he had “full confidence” in Jassy. “Andy is well known inside the company and has been at Amazon almost as long as I have,” he said. “He will be an outstanding leader.” Bezos added that he would stay engaged in Amazon initiatives. “But I will also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, the Washington Post, and my other passions,” he wrote. “I’ve never had more energy, and this isn’t about retiring. I’m super passionate about the impact I think these organizations can have.” Jassy is known for understanding technical details, and has bestowed a rock-star aura to keynotes at AWS’s annual Las Vegas conference. He has occasionally spoken out on social issues, tweeting about the need for police accountability after Breonna Taylor, a Black woman, was killed in her home by white policemen during a botched raid, and in favor of LGBTQ+ rights. Amazon said it was not announcing an AWS replacement for Jassy yet."
2021-02-02T22:33:15Z,technology,Technology,Jeff Bezos to resign as chief executive of Amazon,"Jeff Bezos, billionaire founder of Amazon, will step down as chief executive, the company announced on Tuesday.
Bezos, who will remain executive chair, will hand the reins to Andy Jassy, chief executive of Amazon Web Services, the company’s fast-growing cloud computing business. The surprise news came as Amazon released its latest financial results. Few companies have thrived like Amazon during the coronavirus pandemic, and in the last three months of the year, the company recorded sales of more than $100bn for the first time. Bezos, 57, founded Amazon in 1994 and built it into one of the largest companies in the world, amassing a fortune of $185bn. Amazon, which started as an online bookseller, is now a dominant force in cloud computing, groceries, electronics and entertainment, and employs more than 1.1 million people. “Amazon is what it is because of invention,” said Bezos. “If you do it right, a few years after a surprising invention, the new thing has become normal. People yawn. That yawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive. When you look at our financial results, what you’re actually seeing are the long-run cumulative results of invention. “Right now, I see Amazon at its most inventive ever, making it an optimal time for this transition.” Bezos has stepped back from the day-to-day running of Amazon in recent years to pay more attention to his other interests, including space exploration and his ownership of the Washington Post. But his departure as chief executive was unexpected. Jassy, 52, has long been seen as Bezos’s heir apparent, vying with Jeff Wilke, who ran Amazon’s retail business until he announced plans to retire last year. Amazon Web Services (AWS) – which provides cloud computing and storage for governments and companies including McDonald’s and Netflix – has become one of the company’s most important businesses, accounting for 10% of sales in the last quarter and 52% of the company’s profits. The company had a “record-breaking holiday season” last year, Amazon said, reporting sales of $125.56bn, its largest quarter of all time. The leadership change comes at a strange time for Amazon. While profits continue to surge, it faces pressure from workers who have complained of mistreatment during the pandemic, and increasing political scrutiny of the size and power of its business – not least at AWS. Last month, AWS declined to host Parler, a would-be Twitter rival popular with Donald Trump supporters, which became a communication hub for the rioters who stormed the US Capitol.
Last year, the US Congress grilled Bezos and other top tech executives over the size of their businesses. “These companies, as they exist today, have monopoly power,” said David Cicilline, chair of the House judiciary committee’s antitrust subcommittee. “Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable. This must end.” Tim Hubbard, assistant professor of management at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business, said: “Andy Jassy stepping into the CEO role at Amazon is a natural fit. Amazon Web Services is a powerhouse within the company, driving a lot of profitability. “This transition may free up Bezos to focus on other ideas that he’s been accumulating over the years. In one way, I think it might be freeing for him to have the space to personally innovate again, without having to manage the rest of the company.” Hubbard added: “Given the recent successes at Amazon, especially during the pandemic, it’s going to be hard to disrupt their momentum.” This article was amended on 2 February 2021 to correct the date when the news was announced."
2021-02-02T16:44:37Z,technology,Technology,iPhone update lets Apple Watch users unlock Face ID in a mask,"A year into the global pandemic, Apple has solved the problem of how to unlock iPhones with Face ID without removing your face mask – at least, it has for its most dedicated customers. In the latest version of iOS, the operating system for iPhones, which is being beta tested by the public, users can enable a setting that makes Face ID work even if a mask is worn, but only if the mask is accompanied by an unlocked Apple Watch. The feature, which is borrowed from a similar option that has long been available on Mac computers, takes advantage of the fact that the Apple Watch can tell whether it has been removed from a user’s wrist via a built-in heart-rate sensor. That means that once the watch is unlocked after it has been put on, it can stay unlocked, safe in the knowledge that it is still in the possession of its owner. Face masks have proved problematic for Apple, which has switched most of its devices from fingerprint recognition to facial recognition over the past three years. While some accuracy can be provided by the upper half of the face, and the contours visible beneath the mask, it is not enough to allow a security system to work. In mid-May, Apple released a software update for iPhones that allowed them to recognise when a mask was being worn, and skip straight to requesting a passcode from the user. That sticking-plaster solution has been followed by the latest, more robust option. An Apple Watch doesn’t allow iPhone owners to bypass Face ID entirely. If wearing a mask and an unlocked watch, they will still need to glance at their phone to confirm the unlock. But the setting, which must be actively enabled, reduces the accuracy required for the iPhone to be satisfied that it really is seeing its owner. The strength of the Bluetooth signal between the phone and watch will also be measured, to ensure that they are being held by the same person – similar to how a Covid-19 contact-tracing system uses Bluetooth strength to estimate the distance between two devices. The feature will be introduced as part of Apple’s iOS 14.5 update, which does not yet have an estimated release date. Alongside the Face ID changes, it will include support for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series controllers to iPhones. It will also launch Apple’s App Tracking Transparency feature, a new privacy setting that has launched a war of words between the company and Facebook. The social network has accused Apple of undercutting the business model of the internet by allowing users to opt out of surveillance."
2021-02-02T16:30:34Z,technology,Technology,"Google's search engine not as good as its competitors for news, research finds","Australians trying to stay up to date with the news by searching online may be better off ditching Google and using its competitors, research by Monash University has shown. On Australia Day “Grace Tame” was the most popular search term used on Google – reflecting the fact that she had just been made Australian of the Year. The top 50 results delivered by Google included only 70% of professional news websites, compared with 94% for the same search term on Bing and 82% on Ecosia. Last Sunday Australians rushing to find out more about the suddenly announced coronavirus lockdown in Perth made “perth lockdown” the most popular search term. Google delivered only 80% of news websites in the top 50, compared with 90% from Bing and 86% from Ecosia.
Meanwhile those trying to find out about how federal Liberal MP Kevin Andrews had lost his preselection would have found only 34% of news websites in response to a search on Google, compared with 70% on Bing and 48% on Ecosia. Researchers from the Monash University Climate Change Communication Hub took the top 10 search terms used by Australians on Google on two days last week, and compared results delivered by Google, Microsoft Bing and Ecosia. They found that Bing and Ecosia delivered substantially more professionally produced news in the top 50 results compared with Google. The director of the Climate Change Communication Research Hub, Associate Professor David Holmes, said the results demonstrated the importance of news media to search engines, with the top search terms clearly reflecting that people were trying to learn more about current affairs topics. “It is in the interests of search engines to show news sites because that brings users who are in search of trusted and useful quality content,” he said. “These results suggest that Google’s competitors are well able to deliver that kind of professional content.” The results are significant because Google has threatened to shut down search in Australia if the government passes a law that would force it and Facebook to compensate media companies for using their content. The legislation was tabled in parliament in December and is presently before a parliamentary inquiry. Labor has said it supports the proposal in principle. Meanwhile, Microsoft has said it is ready to pick up the slack if Google delivers on its threats to desert the Australian market. The Monash University results suggest that Microsoft Bing and Ecosia rely more on news media websites than Google. At present, Microsoft and Ecosia are not included in the proposed code, the justification for which is Google and Facebook’s substantial market power. Google is overwhelmingly the dominant search engine in Australia with 94% of the market. Microsoft Bing has just 3.7%. Ecosia, which is a social enterprise contributing its profits to growing trees, has less than 1%. A spokesman for Google responded to the findings by saying “Google is not a news aggregator” and that news-related queries accounted for only 1.25% of searches in Australia each year. “As people come to Google looking for all types of information, we designed Google Search to provide the most relevant and reliable results for someone’s query from across the web (not just from news sites),” he said. “For issues like the coronavirus pandemic, for example, official governmental health authorities provide important information to the public.” But the Monash University results suggest that news-related queries are more important to Google users than Google suggests.
On 31 January, the top 10 search terms included six that were clearly were prompted by the news, including “perth lockdown”, “Melissa Caddick” (the missing Sydney millionaire), Andrew O’Keefe (a game show host dumped by Channel Seven over allegations of domestic violence) and “Kevin Andrews” – as well as the name of the news media website PerthNow. Other search terms concerned reality television shows I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here and Married at First Sight, the cryptocurrency related stock XRP, which had lost more than half of its value in a few hours, and the cricket match between Sydney Thunder and the Brisbane Heat. On Australia Day, the top 10 search terms included both “grace tame” and “Australian of the year 2021” and “Adelaide bushfires” and “Pfizer vaccine”. Search results for “perth lockdowns” led to a wide variety of news outlets, the Monash data shows, with no clear dominance by a particular company. Search results included the commercial broadcasters, the ABC, News Corporation and Nine newspapers and the university sponsored not-for-profit the Conversation, as well as West Australian local news outlets and overseas sources such as the BBC and the Huffington Post. Microsoft Bing was approached for comment but had not responded at the time of publication. Sophie Dembinski, Head of Public Policy at Ecosia, said: “For a long time high quality search results have been a central focus for Ecosia’s product team, so we’re proud to see our news function stand head-to-toe with that of a company that has long dominated the search market - which we should add, has significantly more to spend on R&D than us.” Guardian Australia has been in discussion with Google over inclusion in its new “Showcase” offering that would see the company pay news providers for inclusion in this product."
2021-02-01T18:04:06Z,technology,Technology,Price of bitcoin jumps after Elon Musk says it is 'a good thing',"The price of bitcoin rose on Monday after Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla chief executive, said he was a “supporter” of the cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin is a good thing,” Musk said in comments broadcast on social audio app Clubhouse on Monday. Musk said he was “late to the party” in backing bitcoin. Bitcoin had surged to above $38,000 on Friday after Musk changed his biography on the Twitter social network to simply “#bitcoin”.
Last week he jumped on the GameStop bandwagon, tweeting “Gamestonk”, a play on stock market memes, alongside a link to the WallStreetBets forum on Reddit, where users had banded together to pump up the value of the game retailer’s shares. Musk added in his Clubhouse comments that his tweets about dogecoin, another less popular cryptocurrency, were “really just meant to be jokes”. The value of the dogecoin cryptocurrency, which was branded with a Shiba Inu meme, has increased sharply whenever Musk has tweeted about it. He also made a series of notable claims in his first appearance on the app, including saying that Neuralink, a company that he founded to work on controlling computers with the human brain, had implanted a microchip in a monkey’s brain to enable it to play videogames. Musk became the richest person in the world at the start of the year as the price of shares in Tesla, the US electric car pioneer, soared, but in recent weeks he has used his considerable following to talk up other investments. Musk was one of the characters featured in a Star Wars-style poster, widely shared on the WallStreetBets page on Monday, for an imagined film about the GameStop frenzy. The imagined film was entitled Diamond Hands, a reference to investors who hold on to their extremely risky financial bets even in the most volatile conditions. His comfort with online culture has long been apparent, with the chief executive regularly posting memes, including related to financial topics. However, it has also caused problems for him and his company. In 2019 Musk reached a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission after he tweeted that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share. The tweet caused a sharp rally in Tesla shares, but it later emerged that funding was not in place, and there were suspicions that Musk chose the $420 figure because of its associations with cannabis culture."
2021-02-01T08:13:50Z,technology,Technology,"Microsoft's Bing ready to step in if Google pulls search from Australia, minister says","Microsoft’s Bing is ready to swoop if Google makes good on its threat to remove search from Australia when the mandatory news code becomes law, the government has revealed. The communications minister, Paul Fletcher, said Google dominated in Australia with a market share of 93% but there were other players, including Microsoft and DuckDuckGo, that were talking to the government about replacing it. “Microsoft, a giant American corporation, an information technology powerhouse, is very significantly interested in the market opportunity in Australia, should Google choose to withdraw its presence in search in Australia,” Fletcher told the ABC’s Patricia Karvelas.
Fletcher played down Google’s threat, saying it “don’t always follow through”, and reiterated that the government would not back down. “What Google and Facebook say they intend to do is really a matter for them,” he said. “We made it clear we very much prefer them to stay in Australia, they’re an important, significant part of the ecosystem, but ultimately these are business decisions.” “The Microsoft CEO reached out to the prime minister and proposed a meeting, accompanied by senior executives, I was able to join that meeting, and we had a very informative discussion about Microsoft’s interest in the Australian market. At the moment they have a small market share in search, but they’re interested in expanding that, they’re interested in developing the presence of Bing here.” Fletcher said the prime minister told Facebook’s global CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, that he would not “change from the path that we have set out”, which is based on “a very thorough public policy process”. “Look, ultimately, at the end of the day, if you want to do business in Australia, you need to comply with the laws of the sovereign government of Australia.” The second day of public hearings into the code heard that any funds raised from Google and Facebook should be funnelled into the “newsroom and not the boardroom” of big media companies. The Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance warned of the danger of not specifying where the funds should be spent. “It would be a perverse consequence of the years-long digital platforms inquiry and code development process if funds raised via the code were directed to purposes other than sustaining and increasing news content that serves the public interest,” Meaa’s director of its media section, Adam Portelli, said. Smaller media companies, including regional newspapers, Crikey and the New Daily, told the Senate they supported the code but had reservations about some aspects.
Country Press Australia does not want the ABC and the SBS included in the code because it would diminish the pool of money available for them, and Crikey publisher Eric Beecher supported Google’s push for its product News Showcase to be a mechanism for paying news companies. Beecher said Google had not “stolen content” from media companies or “stolen advertising” and it was a “crazy concept” to suggest otherwise. He proposed the digital giants pay a “social licence”, which would be used to fund public interest journalism. Facebook and Google’s threats to withdraw services should send a chill through those who value democracy, the Centre for Responsible Technology’s Peter Lewis said. “Let’s be clear: what Google and Facebook are really terrified of is the existence of this legislation, because this will provide a global model for addressing the impact of their market dominance of the advertising industry,” Lewis said. “Capitulation will be a recognition that big tech is now more powerful than our elected government, a proposition that is just not sustainable.” Officials from Treasury repeatedly refused to answer questions about their contingency plan should Google and Facebook withdraw some services from Australia. According to the latest Guardian Essential poll, more people are concerned about the prospect of not being able to use Google search and Facebook news if they are removed than those who aren’t concerned (57% vs 43%). Those aged 18 to 34 are most concerned (73%), followed by those 35 to 54 (63%). Those over 55 are not as concerned compared to younger cohorts (38%)."
2021-01-31T14:00:39Z,technology,Technology,The tyranny of passwords – is it time for a rethink?,"Modern life is the act of entering the third character of a long-dead family pet into an online form three times a week, getting it wrong, and speaking to a call-centre worker in India whose real name is almost certainly not Kenny, ad infinitum, until you die. Our ancestors lived short, brutish lives and died in childbirth, or were gored to death on the battlefield, but at least they didn’t have passwords, and that’s something. The tyranny of passwords; it colonises modern life. These petty dictators deny us access to our bank accounts, our baby photos, our phone contracts, even our heating. They reproduce as endlessly as bacteria, and yet, like Tupperware lids, you can never find the one you need. They are our boyfriends, our girlfriends, our children, our pets. A talented and motivated adversary could probably work yours out in the time it has taken you to read this paragraph. Most of the time, not being able to remember your password is merely irritating. But sometimes, password amnesia can be life-altering. After going public with his account of losing the password to around $220m (£161m) worth of bitcoin, German programmer Stefan Thomas, 33, sparked a conversation around passwords, loss, and how you grieve a fortune you’ll never get back. Thomas had three copies of his bitcoin passwords saved on hard drives and a USB stick, but the first two versions failed due to software updates, and the USB stick is password protected. If Thomas enters the password incorrectly 10 times, the data wipes. He has two attempts left, and he can’t remember the password. When we speak, Thomas is remarkably sanguine. “There are some days where I’m almost grateful for it,” he says cheerfully. “There were weeks where I would lie in bed, looking at the ceiling, just completely desperate,” he says. “I’d spend hours trying to think of ways to recover the data, jump up, run to my computer and try it and then it wouldn’t work, so I’d go back to staring at my ceiling.” Eventually, he decided: enough. He climbed out of bed, and forged a career in technology, before founding his own company, Coil.
Not everyone can move on from such a wringing loss. “I’m coming up against a brick wall,” says James Howells, his voice rising. “They don’t even want to have a conversation with me about it! Which is so silly, given the valuation.” He is referring to Newport city council, owner and operator of the rubbish tip into which he accidentally slung a hard drive containing the key to the bitcoins he’d mined in 2009. The bitcoins are now worth £210m, and the 35-year-old cryptocurrency trader from Newport is so desperate to get them back he’s offered 25% of his haul, or £50m, to Newport city council. The council has declined Howells’s offer repeatedly over the past eight years, due to the cost. As gently as possible, I ask if it might be better to let this go? “I’m just looking for an opportunity to search for what belongs to me,” he says, sounding wretched. “And I am willing to share it. But it’s hard to accept it’s gone without being given the opportunity to search. Knowing the hard drive’s there, and there’s still a chance.” We lose things; we forget. It is in our nature, it’s what makes us human. “The art of losing isn’t hard to master,” observed Elizabeth Bishop in her poem One Art. Life is a continual surrendering to loss. Some fare better than others: for every Thomas, there is a Howells. “Lose something every day,” Bishop writes, and we oblige her. We lose coats, books, bags, phones, friends, money, loved ones, mobility and eventually, ourselves. Most of all, we forget our passwords. The average person has close to 80 passwords, hardly any of which they remember. Technology companies have become the custodians of vast tranches of personal data, which they protect for us and mine for profit. I forgot the password to my Google photos album for many years, and then I got a new phone and it did that miraculous thing new phones often do and somehow logged me in. My life in 2013, preserved in aspic. It was jarring to realise that Google remembers more about my life than I do. Because passwords are tedious, humans are very bad at them. “There are literally billions of passwords breached every year,” says Gerald Beuchelt of the password manager LastPass. “It’s a total epidemic. It’s happening on a daily basis.” A Google/Harris poll from 2019 found that 52% of people reuse their passwords across multiple accounts, which is very bad security practice. “The best password is a random password,” says password researcher professor Lorrie Cranor of Carnegie Mellon University. “But people aren’t good at generating random passwords or remembering them.” Almost everything you intuitively believe about passwords is not correct. “If you struggle to remember your passwords,” Cranor says, “write them in a notebook and hide it at home. It’s highly unlikely that a hacker is going to get access to your house.” According to research published by the Garner Group in 2017, 20-50% of all IT helpdesk calls are for password resets. “It’s the biggest overhead on IT helpdesks,” says Siân John, a cybersecurity strategist at Microsoft. “It’s usually in the first week of January, or after the summer holidays – people go on holidays, come back and forget their passwords.”
Our passwords reveal a humanity that is much more shared than we think. “We all think alike,” says Cranor, “and we all do similar things, in creating passwords. People think they are being smart by going diagonally on the keyboard,” Cranor says. “But it’s in all the hacker dictionaries.” John used to play a game where she’d ask her friends five questions, before guessing their passwords. “I’d ask them their parents’, siblings’ and children’s names, anniversaries and birthdays, their pet’s name, and their favourite sporting team,” she says. “I’d usually get 70% of them right.” We would not leave the door to our house open and yet many of us leave our digital accounts vulnerable to cybercriminals every day, because of our laissez-faire attitude to password security. Sometimes, criminals access accounts using personal information a person has shared online, or matching passwords from previous data breaches but, increasingly, hackers also use brute-force software – programmes which match thousands of dictionary words until something fits. “You can brute force most eight character passwords within 10 minutes,” says Beuchelt. The World Economic Forum estimates that cybercrime costs the global economy $2.9m every minute. Around 80% of those attacks are password-related. Matt Hall, a 44-year-old electrician from Walsall, lost his £52,000 life savings through a password breach. He was in the process of buying a house in October 2019 when an email from his solicitor was intercepted. Fraudsters replaced his solicitors’ bank details with their own. “It was the worst day of my life,” he tells me, “apart from losing family members.” Barclays, has yet to refund his money. Hall isn’t sure if it was his email that was hacked, or his solicitor’s – he insists his password was secure. Still, he changed all his passwords after it happened. What are they like now, I ask? “Strong!” he jokes. Modern society’s insistence on password protection can be disenfranchising for older people, who find the number of passwords they’re expected to memorise bewildering. “She doesn’t hear the questions on telephone banking because she’s hard of hearing,” says Anashua Davies of her mother, Dima, who is 84, “and then she forgets her password and tries to put the wrong code in.” Davies often has to help her elderly parents get back into their accounts. Last year, Davies had to drive Dima to the bank because she locked herself out of her telephone banking. She doesn’t blame the bank for having strict security protocols. “People are out there trying to steal from other people,” Davies says. But she wishes there was a way of making things easier. “It’s unfortunate for people like my parents, who don’t have the technology skills to keep up.” There is a solution to all this chaos and confusion: a password manager. “These are apps or small pieces of software,” says Beuchelt, “that store all your different usernames and passwords in secure vaults.” A password manager like LastPass (Google also has a version) will randomly generate impenetrable passwords for all your various accounts, and store them for you. “All users need to do is remember your master password,” says Beuchelt, “and LastPass remembers the rest.” It’s the equivalent of having a book in your house, with all your passwords written in it – only digital and highly secure. Of course, your master password needs to be extremely strong: LastPass recommends a minimum of 12 characters, but the longer the better. A long passphrase, composed of random words, numbers and symbols, that is pronounceable – meaning you’re likely to remember it – but doesn’t use personal information, works best. LastPass doesn’t store its users’ passwords centrally, meaning that even if hackers were able to get into their internal systems they wouldn’t be able to break into accounts. “That gives users the highest degree of security you can get,” says Beuchelt. Before speaking to Beuchelt, I’d viewed people who use password managers with a sort of horrified respect. Who has the foresight to endure the tedium of setting one up? But after speaking to Beuchelt, I’m a convert. I spent a rainy weekend afternoon setting up LastPass. But wouldn’t it be even better to never have to remember another password again? That day is almost nigh. “We’re on the cusp of a passwordless future,” says John. “I’d say, for the ordinary consumers, passwords will be gone within the next two to five years.” The solution is biometrics. The Israeli start-up BioCatch has developed software that can analyse the unique way a person drags their mouse, and use it to catch cybercriminals impersonating users. Other firms are developing technology based on the unique contours of a person’s ears. It is also possible to use the accelerometer sensors that detect motion in smartphones to identify users, based on the way they hold the phone. “We will have a constellation of biometrics,” Cranor says, “not just your fingerprint, but your voice, how you hold your phone and your gait.” I ask Google’s security and identity director Mark Risher whether Google is developing hi-tech alternatives to fingerprint and face ID. He says not. “We want to be equitable because we have users in every country. Fingerprint sensors are cheap now and robust. Technology like ear prints and breath detectors are more esoteric – they’re still at the science project stage. As the technology becomes more mainstream, we’re hoping to invest in it.” The key to integrating biometric data into our lives smartly is to ensure the data never leaves the device. “I love biometrics if they are local,” says Beuchelt. “If they’re on your own phone or laptop and the information isn’t shared anywhere else, that’s good biometrics… Giant centralised databases in India or China – that’s not good. Then you end up creating extremely sensitive databases that are incredibly valuable to cybercriminals and oppressive regimes.” You can change your password, but you can’t change your face. The tyranny of passwords – it is coming to an end. We may soon move seamlessly through life, unencumbered by passwords, like an ermine-wearing oligarch with a chauffeur opening doors. Until that day we labour on, brows furrowed, fingers typing in hope, before an endless flashing computer screen that reads “access denied”."
2021-01-31T02:26:49Z,technology,Technology,Zuckerberg lobbies Josh Frydenberg over plan to force Facebook and Google to pay for news content,"Facebook’s founder Mark Zuckerberg has lobbied senior federal ministers about the proposed code forcing the digital giants to pay media companies, and the prime minister has engaged with Microsoft amid threats from Google about removing its search engine from Australia. With a lobbying offensive in overdrive with Labor expected to endorse the Morrison government’s code after a shadow cabinet meeting this week, and with a Senate inquiry continuing to hear from stakeholders – the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, confirmed the conversation with Zuckerberg on Sunday. Facebook has branded the proposed code unworkable in its current form, and has asked for digital platforms to be given six months’ grace to negotiate deals with news companies directly before being hit with mandatory regulations.
Frydenberg told the ABC his discussion with Zuckerberg had been constructive, but the tech mogul had not convinced the Australian government to back down. With parliament set to resume for 2021, the platforms have engaged politically connected lobbyists and are pulling out all stops to try to scale back or scuttle the proposal. Google has threatened to remove its search engine from Australia and Facebook has warned it will remove news from its feed for all Australian users if the code proceeds. As well as confirming the high-level approach from Facebook, Frydenberg also revealed on Sunday that Scott Morrison had spoken to Microsoft, which operates a rival search engine to Google. He said Microsoft was “watching this very closely” and was “mulling expansion opportunities in Australia”. The government remained “in detailed discussions with Google, with Facebook, with the other players across the industry” – discussions that had been under way for some time. Australia’s major media players, hit by technological disruption and by the economic shock associated with Covid-19, have also lobbied extensively for fairer commercial arrangements with the platforms. The proposed code – a world first – aims to address the imbalance in bargaining power between the news media and tech giants. Google and Facebook would have to pay for displaying news content and provide media companies with information on changes that might affect their traffic – such as alterations to news rankings or the search algorithm. If they failed to comply, they could be forced to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in fines. The proposal was developed by Australia’s competition watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Although Labor supports the code in principle, its communications spokeswoman, Michelle Rowland, said last week that the government needed to be clear with internet users and businesses what Google’s threatened departure from Australia – if that eventuated – would mean in practical terms. Frydenberg said on Sunday he didn’t “dismiss the threats” but “I’m not intimidated by them either”. The code was “the product of an 18-month inquiry, world-leading inquiry, by the ACCC, and at every step of the way, these businesses have been consulted”. As the process went on, the story from the platforms appeared to be changing: “The goalposts seem to be shifting because originally they had a concern with the algorithm requirements of notification, then it was about value exchange and then it was about a final arbitration model. “Now we’re told that if we go ahead with this, we’re going to break the internet.” Frydenberg said the government’s view was it was clear current practices had to change: “What I do know is that media businesses should be paid for content.” • Guardian Australia has been in discussion with Google over inclusion in its new “Showcase” offering that would see the company pay news providers for inclusion in this product."
2021-01-31T00:05:22Z,technology,Technology,Mighty Amazon looks all but unassailable as Covid continues,"The earliest references to the “one-stop shop” emerged during the first decades of 20th century as the fast-growing US economy spurred rapid retail innovation. A single location for various products provides obvious benefits: removing the hassle of travelling around town to visit different stores. Jeff Bezos redefined that logic for the internet age, making Amazon a dominant (and perhaps ambivalent) force first in selling books, and then in pretty much everything else. Before 2020 Amazon was a phenomenon, but the coronavirus pandemic has made it all but ubiquitous. The numbers in its financial results for the last three months of 2020, to be published on Tuesday, will be even bigger than Amazon’s earlier instalments in the first pandemic year. Christmas and Thanksgiving always make the final quarter of the year the strongest for Amazon. Christmas 2020 will mainly be remembered for locked-down celebrations, but analysts predict that it will also mark the first time Amazon’s revenue surpasses $100bn in one quarter. In fact, consensus estimates collated by S&P Global Market Intelligence are forecasting sales of about $120bn – 37% up on the same period in 2019. Profits before tax are pegged at $4.4bn – shy of the record $6.8bn it made in the three months to September, but higher than any single quarter before the pandemic. It was only in 2016 that single-quarter profits topped $1bn, but that’s because the Bezos strategy is to invest spare cash in relentless, ruthless expansion and innovation, so that rivals cannot creep up on it.
There are some potential threats to Amazon’s dominance, but they seem remote. Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce group – which also updates investors on Tuesday – has grown at a relentless pace, but its founder Jack Ma is now in a high-stakes political battle with premier Xi Jinping. There is always a chance (albeit seemingly remote now) that Amazon, the disrupter par excellence of high street retail, could be upended by challengers such as Shopify, the retail internet tech provider. Some business models – Chinese social commerce pioneer Pinduoduo, for example – seem baffling until you see the enthusiasm and the revenues they generate. And the pandemic has forced bricks-and-mortar retailers to look online as well, which could dent Amazon’s market share. Amazon’s growth has various avenues. Its server subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, was created almost by accident, but is a margin machine that shows little sign of slowing, given the pandemic-accelerated shift to cloud services. There are signs of success in its battle for the sofa with its Prime video streaming service drawing customers. And its store of info on what people actually buy – possibly the most valuable data for advertisers – has quietly made it the third-biggest force in online advertising. Diversified profit sources ease the pressure for success from each arm from quarter to quarter, and make it much easier for Amazon to incubate businesses in sectors it has not yet cracked, such as fresh food retail. That diversity also means that regulators are less likely to land a blow – although the company’s treatment of warehouse workers during the pandemic and its undercutting of sellers with its own-label products have drawn political fire. At the start of 2021 Bezos lost his crown as the world’s richest man to his space-race rival, Tesla boss Elon Musk. The symbolism is probably misplaced: 2020 showed that Amazon’s efforts to be the online everything shop will take some beating."
2021-01-30T19:00:16Z,technology,Technology,Facebook ‘still making money from anti-vax sites’,"Facebook is allowing users to profit from the spread of potentially dangerous false theories and misinformation about the pandemic and vaccines, including deploying money-raising tools on pages with content flagged up by the social media giant’s own factcheckers. An investigation has found 430 pages – followed by 45 million people – using Facebook’s tools, including virtual “shops” and fan subscriptions, while spreading false information about Covid-19 or vaccinations. The findings come despite a promise the platform made last year that no user or company should directly profit from false information about immunisation against Covid-19. Facebook generally does not share this income, but it does occasionally take a cut, and benefits financially from users engaging with content and staying on its services, exposing them to more ads. The research, by the London-headquartered Bureau of Investigative Journalism, is likely to have uncovered only a tiny snapshot of the vast amount of monetised misinformation on Facebook related to the pandemic and vaccines. A Facebook spokesman said the company was investigating the examples brought to its attention, and had “removed a small number of the pages shared with us for violating our policies”. However, many of the posts identified as misinformation do not violate Facebook rules, the spokesman added, without providing any details. “Our initial investigation shows a large number of the pages flagged had zero violations against our harmful misinformation policies, and we’d dispute the overall accuracy of the data being provided,” he said. The pages identified included sites for comedians and religious leaders, social media personalities and traditional media reporters. There are a large number of alternative health sites, focused on a range of subjects from nutrition to yoga and wellness. Only a minority are clearly focused on the pandemic, or anti-vaccine sentiment. The others are sharing content to broader audiences. Seven languages are represented – including German, Hebrew, Polish and Spanish – reaching readers around the world.
More than 260 of the pages the bureau identified have posted misinformation about vaccines. The remainder include false information on the pandemic, on vaccines more broadly, or a combination of the two. More than 20 pages identified have gained Facebook’s blue tick signalling authenticity. For Facebook, offering ways to make money is probably a route to encouraging people to use its platform rather than its competitors’, according to Dr Claire Wardle, executive director of First Draft, a US-based non-profit organisation fighting online misinformation, which contributed to the bureau’s research. However, Facebook can also profit from the popularity of brands and individuals who spread misinformation. It takes a cut of 5% to 30% on its Stars currency, used by fans to tip creators who stream live video. Facebook also briefly took up to 30% of fees paid by new supporters from January last year, but reversed this in August. The bureau found two pages using Stars: An0maly and Sid Roth’s It’s Supernatural, a religious site which has blamed the pandemic on abortion and has featured guests describing a dream in which God showed them the virus being created in a Chinese lab. Between them, the pages have reached more than 2.6 million people. The site run by An0maly, real name AJ Feleski, who describes himself as a “news analyst & hip-hop artist”, is one of the most influential pages sharing misinformation to be identified by the investigation, with more than 1.5 million followers. A video from last March, in which he questions if the pandemic is “bio-terrorism”, is one of at least three posts on the page that Facebook’s factcheckers have flagged for containing false or partly false information. Yet even on Saturday a strap appears under the videos inviting viewers to pay to “Become a supporter” and “Support An0maly and enjoy special benefits”. Facebook’s policies for creators using monetisation tools include rules against misinformation, especially medical misinformation. In November, Facebook, along with Google and Twitter, agreed a joint statement with the UK government committing to “the principle that no user or company should directly profit from Covid-19 vaccine mis/disinformation. This removes an incentive for this type of content to be promoted, produced and be circulated.” The bureau’s findings suggest Facebook has breached this agreement, as well as failed to enforce its own policies. A Facebook spokesman said: “Pages which repeatedly violate our community standards – including those which spread misinformation about Covid-19 and vaccines – are prohibited from monetising on our platform. “We take aggressive steps to remove Covid misinformation that leads to imminent physical harm, including false information about approved vaccines.”
The company removed 12 million pieces of Covid misinformation between March and October, and placed factcheck warning labels on 167 million other pieces of content, he added. Organisations including the UN, the World Health Organization and Unesco said in September that online misinformation “continues to undermine the global response and jeopardises measures to control the pandemic”. Some of the pages identified in the investigation also directed their followers to more extreme content that has been largely scrubbed from social media. Veganize, a Portuguese-language page based in Brazil with 129,000 followers, offers paid supporter subscriptions. A “pinned post”, which is fixed at the top of the page even as new content is added, carries a link to a collection of files hosted on Google including “Plandemic”, a pair of conspiracy-laden, thoroughly discredited videos that briefly went viral last summer before social networks made strenuous efforts to remove them. Groups spreading information flagged by factcheckers as false have also used Facebook to fundraise. The Informed Consent Action Network (Ican), a US non-profit, is one of the most well-funded organisations in the US opposing vaccinations. Facebook and YouTube removed pages for Highwire, an online show run by Ican founder Del Bigtree that made claims repeatedly rated as false by factcheckers, for which Ican says it is suing the tech companies. Yet despite removing the Highwire page, Facebook still allows Ican to solicit donations from its more than 44,000 followers on a page that has had at least two posts flagged by factcheckers. According to its page, Ican has raised almost £24,000 since February 2020. Facebook must approve organisations signing up to raise funds and vaccine misinformation is explicitly cited as a reason that fundraising may be removed from an organisation. Wardle, from First Draft, believes the money-making systems Facebook offers could encourage people to spread misinformation. “It is human nature. We know one of the motivations is financial,” she said. “They have started to believe these things, but when you are in that circle, you also realise there is a way to make money, then you realise that the more you get hits the more money you are making. It’s more than the dopamine hit – it’s dopamine plus dollars.”"
2021-01-29T07:00:39Z,technology,Technology,Chromecast with Google TV review: full smart TV upgrade with voice remote,"Google’s latest Chromecast streaming media dongle is a bit different. Instead of just streaming or “casting” content from your mobile or computer like its predecessors, the new device acts more like a modern smart TV. With a full interface and a remote, the new Chromecast with Google TV costs £59.99 and sits above the basic £30 Chromecast. You can still Google Cast to the new device, but the new flat plastic dongle is more than just a simple receiver, running the full Android TV software similar to the Nvidia Shield or smart TVs from Sony and others. Specifications Processor: quad-core ARM RAM: 2GB Storage: 4GB Connectivity: wifi ac, Bluetooth, HDMI 2.0b (HDCP2.2) Software: Android TV (Android 10) Format support: up to 4K @ 60Hz, Dolby Vision, HDR10, HDR10+; Dolby Atmos, Digital and Digital Plus Dimensions: 162 x 61 x 12.5mm Weight: 55g Google TV
Once plugged in, the new Chromecast is set up using the Google Home app on an Android, iPhone or iPad in about five minutes. Scan the QR code on your TV, log in with the required Google account, and choose some apps to install. You can also add additional Google accounts for limited multi-user support such as the ability to access more than one account in apps such as YouTube. The interface is fairly simple. Individual apps for your media services work like they do on most smart TVs, navigated with the remote’s direction pad, select and back buttons. Most of the TV apps you’d expect are available, including Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+, BT Sport, YouTube and the UK catchup services, such as BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub and My5. The big outliers are All 4, BritBox and Apple TV, which are not available. You can still cast All 4 and BritBox from a phone to the dongle, but those looking to watch Apple TV+ or their iTunes library are out of luck. Also strangely not available yet is Google’s Stadia game-streaming service. Google TV also tries to bring content out of the apps and into the main interface, learning what you like as you watch, and suggesting more of what you might want to see. The first “for you” pane has personalised picks, a list of your installed apps, plus popular movies and TV shows across various genres and types curated by algorithm. Press and hold select on any movie or show thumbnail and you can see where it is available, watch a trailer, add it to a watchlist, mark it as already seen and like or dislike it. It also pulls in trends from Google such as most-searched movies, topics such as “Tom Hanks” and videos from YouTube. Tabs for Movies and Shows narrow the recommendations down by type. The Apps tab shows you all your apps plus a store front for finding new ones for Android TV. Lastly, the Library tab shows you any movies or TV shows you’ve purchased from the Google Play Store. Google Assistant
There’s also a search tab, but the interface is entirely geared up for using voice to search with the remote. Press and hold the Google Assistant button while speaking and it will either find what you want or perform the desired action. You can ask for an app, movie or TV show, or a combination of terms such as “Timeless on Netflix” to launch straight into it. You can also search via movie element, such as actor or director. Ask for Steven Spielberg movies and it’ll show any from your subscription services, Google Play Movies and also apps such as BBC iPlayer. You can even narrow it down by production studio or actor, but ask it for “Steven Spielberg movies with Tom Hanks” and it’ll suggest The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons – proving Google isn’t infallible. It can occasionally show you things from the Google Play Store that are available from one of your subscription services too, something logging out and logging back into Netflix and other services appeared to cure. Beyond search, Assistant can control playback such as “skip 15 minutes” and do some of the things the voice assistant is capable of on a smartphone, tablet or smart display. That includes streaming the feeds from compatible smart cameras, turn lights on and off, look up the weather, showing events from your calendar and other bits. The remote can also be configured to control your TV or sound system and has its own power, input select and mute buttons plus a small volume rocker on the side, which I found a bit fiddly to use. Performance
The Chromecast with Google TV generally performs well when actively streaming content. Apps launch fairly quickly, movies start streaming in high quality immediately on start and the dongle supports all the latest video and audio formats, including 4K UHD, HDR10 and HDR10+, Dolby Vision and the various Dolby surround sound technologies including the latest Atmos. The dongle applies the appropriate HDR format for your TV over the whole interface and all content – similar to the Apple TV. But the sound and HDR format you actually get on the movie or TV show is still dependent on the streaming app and content you’re using. While the interface is slick and modern, when you’re returning to the home screen from an app or video it can occasionally be a bit slow. Sometimes the interface appears in silhouette with blank boxes and a loading animation, waiting for the thumbnails for the various services, content and apps to appear. Navigating within apps such as Netflix is also not quite as fast as it could be. It’s not slow, per se, but you can certainly click the navigation buttons quicker than the interface moves. I found myself waiting for it to catch up a couple of times when I was in a hurry, which can’t be said for the more expensive Nvidia Shield or Apple TV 4K. Sustainability
The Chromecast with Google TV is made with 46% post-consumer recycled plastic in its mechanical parts. The remote takes standard AAA batteries, of which two non-rechargeable types are included. The use of more sustainable materials is part of Google’s commitment to include recycled or renewable materials in at least 50% of plastic used in its products launching from 2025. The company publishes environmental impact reports for some of its products, including the Chromecast with Google TV. Google will recycle all its devices free of charge. Observations You have to hold the Assistant button on the remote for longer than you’d expect after you stop speaking or it will miss the last word you said. You can show your pictures from Google Photos as a screensaver when not actively using the Chromecast, or just ask for your photos from Google Assistant. There’s no support for any non-Dolby audio formats such as DTS. Price The Chromecast with Google TV costs £59.99, but is frequently discounted, and comes in three colours. For comparison, the Chromecast costs £30, the Nvidia Shield costs £149.99, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K costs £49.99 and the Apple TV 4K costs £179.99. Verdict The Chromecast with Google TV gets most things right, reinvigorating Google’s smart TV system with a modern interface, useful voice search and enhanced Assistant features. It might have Chromecast in the name, but the new dongle is far more than a simple cast receiver. Having a remote to control playback without having to reach for your phone is certainly an upgrade. The lack of the All 4, BritBox and Apple TV apps disappoints, while the dongle isn’t always the fastest available, but it is fairly cheap and is made of recycled plastic. The Chromecast with Google TV is a useful, good-value smart TV upgrade that’s a big step up from the basic cast receiver. Pros: modern interface, good voice search, Google Assistant, most streaming apps available, Google Cast support, HDR10/10+, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, recycled material. Cons: interface can be a little slow at times, no All 4, no BritBox, no Apple TV, no Stadia, remote can be fiddly.

2021-01-28T19:14:49Z,technology,Technology,Apple and Facebook at odds over privacy move that will hit online ads,"Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, has launched his strongest attack on Facebook yet, as the two companies face off over Apple’s plans for new privacy features that would severely limit online advertising. Speaking to the Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference on “Data Privacy Day”, Cook defended Apple’s decision to introduce the features, called App Tracking Transparency (ATT). That setting, coming to iPhones in “early spring”, will for the first time require apps to ask for users’ permission in order to track them around the web. Apple’s ATT plans have brought stark criticism from Facebook, which claimed late last year that it would kill small businesses by preventing them from advertising to would-be customers. Facebook’s head of ads, Dan Levy, said Apple was pushing for “anti-personalised advertising, and we think is trying to take the world back 10 or 20 years”. Cook hit back on Thursday, defending ATT and attacking Facebook – without naming the company directly – as an irresponsible actor. He said the company expected many users to block tracking entirely. “Some may well think that sharing this degree of information is worth it for more targeted ads,” he said. “Many others, I suspect, will not, just as most appreciated it when we built a similar functionality into Safari limiting web trackers several years ago. “If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are not choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform. Too many are still asking the question ‘how much can we get away with?’, when they need to be asking ‘what are the consequences?’. “What are the consequences of prioritising conspiracy theories and violent incitement simply because of their high rates of engagement? What are the consequences of not just tolerating but rewarding content that undermines public trust in lifesaving vaccinations? What are the consequences of seeing thousands of users join extremist groups, and then perpetuating an algorithm that recommends even more?”
While Facebook has not responded to Cook’s comments publicly, the social network is reportedly preparing its own offensive. According to the Information, a tech news site, Facebook is planning to launch an antitrust lawsuit against Apple, arguing that the company is breaking US law by requiring independent developers to follow rules that Apple does not itself have to abide by. As well as ATT, Facebook is likely to target a number of other features of iOS that it says are applied unfairly. A new set of “privacy nutrition labels”, for instance, require Facebook to list the hundreds of types of data it collects about users on the App Store, while Apple services such as iMessage, which cannot be deleted and are thus not on the store, do not display that information in the same way. Facebook has also complained about Apple’s payment rules barring it from supporting companies that want to sell services such as online yoga classes, and Apple preventing the social network from launching a gaming app containing social games, even as Apple charges £5 a month for its own Apple Arcade. On Facebook’s earnings call on Wednesday, the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said Apple was focused on “on gaining share in apps and services against us and other developers. So Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own.”"
2021-01-28T17:24:00Z,technology,Technology,Facebook board set to rule on Trump ban reverses four content removal cases,"Facebook’s oversight board, the “supreme court” set up by the company to relieve Mark Zuckerberg of having the final say over moderation, has issued its first decisions, overturning the social network’s choices on four of the five first cases it has heard. The cases, all of which were appeals to reinstate content taken down by Facebook, covered a wide range of topics, from female nudity, to Russian-language ethnic slurs, through islamophobia and Covid misinformation. The board’s decisions are binding under the agreement between Facebook and its quasi-independent overseer. Facebook now has seven days to restore content in the four cases where the board deemed it necessary. The first case to be overturned involved Facebook’s decision to take down, for hate speech, a post from Myanmar which accused Muslims of being inhumane and psychologically maladapted. The board disagreed with Facebook’s translation of the caption, arguing that it was not directly derogatory, and said that the important context is that the text was accompanied by a contrast between reactions to cartoons of the prophet Muhammad, and the ongoing ethnic cleansing in Xinjiang. “That expression of opinion is protected under Facebook’s Community Standards and does not reach the level of hate speech,” the board concluded. That decision was harshly criticised by the US civil liberties group Muslim Advocates, which accused the oversight board of “bending over backwards to excuse hate in Myanmar – a country where Facebook has been complicit in a genocide against Muslims.” “It is clear that the oversight board is here to launder responsibility for Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg,” spokesman Eric Naing said. “Instead of taking meaningful action to curb dangerous hate speech on the platform, Facebook punted responsibility to a third party board that used laughable technicalities to protect anti-Muslim hate content that contributes to genocide.” In a very different case, the board also took an appeal from a Brazilian user who had posted a picture promoting awareness of signs of breast cancer. The picture was automatically removed by Instagram’s systems, which wrongly classified it as adult content, but after the board selected the case, Facebook restored the post and argued that the restoration made it moot. In its conclusion, which agreed that Facebook was right to restore the image, the board also provided recommendations to Facebook, advising that the company ensure that users can appeal automated decisions to a human being, and specifically revise Instagram’s guidelines to allow female nipples to be shown to raise breast cancer awareness. The most contentious decision is likely to be a decision to restore Covid misinformation posted by a French user to the site. In the post, removed by Facebook but referred by the company directly to the board, the user claimed that hydroxychloroquine could “cure” Covid-19. The drug is not effective against the virus. Facebook argued that the post ran the risk of causing imminent harm, but was overruled by the oversight board, which instead concluded that “the user was opposing a governmental policy and aimed to change that policy”. The decision to block the post “did not comply with international human rights standards on limiting freedom of expression”, the board added, in requiring the post to be restored. In a statement, Facebook said: “The board rightfully raises concerns that we can be more transparent about our Covid-19 misinformation policies. We agree that these policies could be clearer and intend to publish updated Covid-19 misinformation policies soon. We do believe, however, that it is critical for everyone to have access to accurate information, and our current approach in removing misinformation is based on extensive consultation with leading scientists, including from the CDC and WHO. During a global pandemic this approach will not change.” In the final overturned decision, the board agreed with a user that a quote intended to compare Donald Trump to Joseph Goebbels was not intended to praise Goebbels. The board sided with Facebook on a single case, agreeing that a post referring to Azerbaijanis as “тазики” or washbowl, was intended as a pun on the word “азики”, an ethnic slur for the nation. While Facebook has committed to following the board’s main decisions, it has made no similar promise about whether to follow the extensive recommendations the oversight board has made alongside. That advice, which pushes for Facebook to be clearer in its community guidelines, better in its moderation, and more transparent in its enforcement, can be rejected by the social network, although it has committed to responding to the recommendations within a month. In the near future, the board will also be issuing a finding to its most high-profile case to date, and possibly ever – the decision to suspend Donald Trump from Facebook and Instagram. “Recent events in the United States and around the world have highlighted the enormous impact that content decisions taken by internet services have on human rights and free expression,” the board said. “The challenges and limitations of the existing approaches to moderating content draw attention to the value of independent oversight of the most consequential decisions by companies such as Facebook.”"
2021-01-28T09:30:30Z,technology,Technology,Tesla shares fall despite electric carmaker's first annual profit,"Tesla shares fell in after-hours trading after the electric carmaker’s earnings fell short of expectations, despite recording its first annual profit, after a bumper payout to its chief executive, Elon Musk. Operating income rose to $575m (£420m) in the fourth quarter, but it was held back by a $267m payout for Musk. Under a scheme waved through by investors in 2018, Musk could eventually be eligible for awards worth up to $55.8bn as the share price rises. Tesla is expanding rapidly as it tries to match its manufacturing capabilities to a stock market valuation that surged eightfold during 2020 to make it the most valuable automotive company in the world. That rise in value has made Musk the world’s richest person, with a net worth of $206bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. During 2020, Tesla made an annual profit for the first time, with net income of $721m. However, it made more than $1.5bn from selling regulatory credits to other carmakers during the year, a profit source that will disappear as rivals catch up with electric car production. The average selling price of new Teslas fell by 11% during the fourth quarter of 2020 as it shifted towards cheaper Model 3 and Y models.
The disparity between its earnings and its valuation – at $819bn when markets closed on Wednesday – means investors are keenly awaiting signs of the company’s future growth. Tesla said it expected to grow output by more than 50% during 2021, but gave no further detail. Tesla last year narrowly missed its target of delivering 500,000 vehicles, but it is racing to finish new factories in Texas and Berlin. It is still on track to build its first vehicles in both plants during 2021, as well as expanding its factory in Shanghai further, Tesla said. One big advantage Tesla gained during its enormous share price increase was easy access to capital, removing a significant concern in earlier years. Tesla had $19.4bn of cash or cash equivalents at the end of December, a pile that will allow it to continue to make big investments in technologies that it views as key to future earnings such as still-under-development autonomous driving capabilities."
2021-01-27T22:24:15Z,technology,Technology,Apple records most profitable quarter ever as sales soar amid pandemic,"Apple finished 2020 with its most profitable quarter ever as sales of its high end iPhones, tablets and laptops soared amid the pandemic. The company announced that sales for the three months ending on 26 December 2020 totalled $111.4bn and it had made a profit of $28.7bn, 29% higher than the same period last year.
The holiday period is a crucial time for Apple, accounting for 30% of its sales, and 2020’s bumper quarter was boosted by strong sales of its latest iPhone. The blowout results, stronger than Wall Street had expected, were fueled in large part by sales of the company’s latest iPhones. iPhone revenues were $65.6bn for the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. “We’re gratified by the enthusiastic customer response to the unmatched line of cutting-edge products that we delivered across a historic holiday season,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in a statement. The quarterly report was Apple’s first following the launch of its iPhone 12 mini, the iPhone 12, the iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone 12 Pro Max. But the company performed strongly across the board with its services division, which includes its App Store and licensing deals, delivering revenues of $15.76bn, up 24% year-over-year. Other products’ revenues, including the Apple Watch and home products, were up 29% at $12.97bn and Mac sales were up 21% at $8.68bn. Cook said that the results could have been even better if not for the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced Apple to temporarily close some of its stores around the world. “Taking the stores out of the equation, particularly for iPhones and wearables, there’s a drag on sales,” Cook told CNBC. Apple’s record results followed record results from Microsoft on Monday, which recorded $40bn in sales for the last quarter. Facebook, too, announced better than expected results on Tuesday, with revenues of $28bn for the last quarter. “Our December quarter business performance was fueled by double-digit growth in each product category, which drove all-time revenue records in each of our geographic segments and an all-time high for our installed base of active devices,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s chief financial officer. Apple’s shares fell 2% in after-hours trading but have risen 84% over the past 12 months."
2021-01-27T22:12:01Z,technology,Technology,Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says platform will halt political suggestions,"Facebook will halt algorithm-driven recommendations of political Facebook groups around the world and is looking into reducing political content in its News Feed, according to chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg. “People don’t want politics and fighting to take over their experience on the platform,” Zuckerberg told investors. “We’re going to focus even more on being a force for bringing people closer together,” he added. Zuckerberg’s remarks came on the quarterly earnings call for the platform. Facebook on Wednesday beat analyst predictions in the October-December quarter, with a revenue of $28bn, or $3.88 a share The earnings announced Wednesday cover only the end of 2020 and thus do not reflect the market’s reaction to revelations about the role of social media in the 6 January insurrection and Facebook’s decision to ban Donald Trump in the subsequent days.
Facebook had announced ahead of the 2020 elections it would stop recommendations of partisan groups to users in the US, but a report from the Markup showed users were still regularly funneled into political groups through the platform’s algorithms as recently as early January. Following the report, Democratic senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts sent a letter to Facebook demanding answers as to why it did not fulfill its promises. “Facebook’s system of recommending political groups poses grave threats to American democracy and public safety,” Markey said. The 33% year-over-year growth announced on Facebook’s earnings report came despite a difficult year marked by an advertiser boycott, rumblings of antitrust actions, and content moderation concerns surrounding the 2020 presidential election. “For now, Facebook seems untouchable,” said Tamara Littleton, analyst and chief executive officer at social media agency The Social Element. “But the fact remains: Facebook has damaged its reputation through consistently putting profit before anything else.” In a statement accompanying the report, Facebook’s chief financial officer said the company benefited from the ongoing shift amid the pandemic to online commerce, as well as the shift in consumer demand “towards products and away from services”. He also stated Facebook continues to face difficulties, including the ongoing economic impact of the pandemic as well as “the evolving regulatory landscape”. Facebook and other tech giants have been subject to antitrust probes and other regulation in 2020, a trend that is expected continue or accelerate in 2021. “We continue to face significant uncertainty as we manage through a number of cross currents in 2021,” the statement said. Authorities filed a flurry of lawsuits against big tech firms in 2020, including long-anticipated suits filed against Facebook by the Federal Trade Commission and 48 states accusing the social media giant of abusing its power in social networking to squash smaller competitors, and sought remedies that could include a forced spinoff of Instagram and WhatsApp. This, and actions against Google, have been declared the biggest antitrust action since the 1970s. Enforcement from the Biden administration is likely to differ from the government’s approach under Trump, who appeared to have a personal vendetta against the platforms over perceived censorship. Still, Biden has promised to take action to restrain big tech. In the call with investors on Wednesday, Zuckerberg also took shots at competitor Apple, arguing Facebook subsidiary WhatsApp is “superior” to Apple’s iMessage in terms of privacy. Zuckerberg also criticized iOS14, a new Apple system update that will require apps to get permission to track user behavior, saying it will impact Facebook’s advertising business – by far the bulk of its revenue – as users will be able to opt out of data collection. “Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own impact,” Zuckerberg said. Facebook’s stocks fell as much as 6% in after-hours trading as the market on the whole experienced its worst day since October 2020."
2021-01-27T16:30:48Z,technology,Technology,Important stories hidden in Google's 'experiment' blocking Australian news sites,"Google’s “experiment” in Australia to remove major news sites from search results is hiding important news stories from hundreds of thousands of Australians. In some cases filtering out mainstream news publications from search results is also resulting in lower-quality publications being promoted, including a news website known for spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories. The search giant previously admitted that it is running “a few experiments that will each reach about 1% of Google Search users in Australia to measure the impacts of news businesses and Google Search on each other”, but has previously refused to answer detailed questions about the experiment.
For some users, major news sites will not show up in search results, and users are not informed that their search results are being restricted. People are still able to view the news stories in Google news, and can find news stories by normal methods such as visiting news websites directly or using alternative search engines. The experiment does not remove results that link to official information, such as that found on government websites. A Google spokesperson confirmed that a “small per cent of users” would not see some news stories in Google search, but disputed that this would prevent Australians from reaching news sources. “It is demonstrably incorrect to claim this has prevented Australians from reaching news sources. First, these are tiny experiments, impacting only a very small per cent of users, so the vast majority of users are totally unaffected,” he said. “Second, even users affected by the experiments can continue to access the news websites, for example they can go to publishers’ websites directly, use publishers’ apps, via Google News, follow links on social media or shared by friends and family, or get news from TV, radio, print newspapers and magazines.” Guardian Australia was able to generate browser sessions that were affected by news site removal, and can reveal the impact of blocking news sites compared with a normal search session. A comparison of two side-by-side search sessions shows that in this case the “experiment” removes results for major Nine Entertainment websites such as the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the AFR; News Corp Australia websites, including major news sites like the Herald Sun, but also including regional publications such as the Gympie Times; the Guardian’s website; and Seven West Media websites such as 7news and the West Australian.
Even searches like “the Age” or “the Herald Sun” will not return the main news websites in search results. Other news sites such as the ABC, BBC and Canberra Times were unaffected. The ABC was reportedly filtered out of search results for a user last week, so it’s possible the difference in news sites is down to different “experiments”. This filter results in users being unable to see some news stories entirely in search results if it is not being covered widely. For example, Guardian Australia’s exclusive story about allegations of mistreatment of an Indigenous woman in an ACT prison did not show up at all in search results affected by the filter.
The Sydney Morning Herald’s story about increasing donations from property developers was similarly affected, and the original story did not show up at all in searches affected by Google’s restrictions, only mentions of the story on social media and other websites. For other news stories, such as this story about Asic, the corporate regulator being targeted by hackers, the filter results in the top news results being from sources outside of Australia.
In some cases, the experiment has resulted in sources of questionable quality being promoted over the blocked news websites. A search for “Scott Morrison” conducted last Thursday by a colleague who was experiencing the restriction on news sites returned the Epoch Times as one of the top three results. The Epoch Times has reportedly spread pro-Trump conspiracy theories, QAnon content, and anti-vaccine misinformation.
Google has said that the experiment will reach around 1% of users. However, given the large market share of Google in Australia (about 95%), and the high proportion of Australians who use the internet for news purposes (at least 86% for those over 18), this experiment could feasibly affect at least 160,000 people based on a back-of-the-envelope calculation.
A spokesperson from Google said the experiment related to its ongoing involvement in the development of the Australian government’s draft bargaining code that would force them to negotiate a fair price for displaying local news content. “We remain committed to reaching a solution for a workable code, as we have been throughout this whole process. And the small, short-term experiments we are currently running are part of our preparations for the code, which among other things, may require us to demonstrate the impact of news on our platform,” he said. Google has previously criticised the proposed code in messages to the search engine’s users while Facebook has warned it could block Australians from sharing local news as a consequence. •If you’re affected by the news site “experiment” and you want to restore normal search behaviour, you can try clearing cookies, or searching in an incognito window. Guardian Australia has been in discussion with Google over inclusion in its new “Showcase” offering that would see the company pay news providers for inclusion in this product."
2021-01-27T16:30:47Z,technology,Technology,Australian watchdog warns Google may be misusing its market power in $9.1bn online ad market,"The Australian government looks set to open another front in its fight against Google, with the Australian competition watchdog warning the company could potentially be misusing its market power in the $9.1bn online display advertising market. As part of its long-running digital platforms inquiry, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission launched an inquiry in March into the complex world of online ads, and issues with the markets where those ads are bought and sold. Ads displayed on websites are most commonly determined through an automated auction system that figures out which advertisement to present based on the information held about who is visiting that site, as well as the price sold to present the ad.
The interim report from the ACCC, to be released by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, on Thursday, has found Google is the dominant provider across all aspects of the online ad market examined by the inquiry. “While there are a large number of ad tech providers across the supply chain, Google is by far the largest provider of each of the four key services considered,” the report states, according to a selection briefed by the treasurer’s office to media outlets prior to its release. The report found in the display advertising market, which made up 37% of the $9.1bn online ad spend in 2019-2020, Google accounted for between 50% and 100% of the four markets examined, where advertisers buy ads, run ad campaigns, and publishers sell ad space. The ACCC warned Google’s position within various parts of the supply chain, and a lack of transparency over the supply chain, meant Google is “likely to have the ability and incentive to favour its own related business interests (self-preferencing).” The report found that fees for ad services were quite high, making up 28% of advertiser expenditure on display ad impressions in Australia in 2019. If Google was found to be self-preferencing, it could be a misuse of market power under Australian competition law, the ACCC said in the report, but it had not yet reached a view on that. The regulator said it would continue to examine this issue before delivering the final report to the government in August. It has sought feedback on proposals to strengthen rules around conflicts of interest and self-preferencing. The ACCC has also proposed more transparency around the supply chain from advertiser to seller, as well as a proposal to make it easier for users of the ad tech systems to move data between operators. Frydenberg said in a statement the government noted the competition concerns and the “continued dominance of tech giants”.
“Digital platforms have fundamentally changed the way that media content is produced, distributed and consumed,” he said. “To that end, we need to ensure our regulatory frameworks keep pace with the changes being driven by digital platforms.” It is the latest front in the government’s battle with tech companies Google and Facebook, as the two companies last week threatened to withdraw search and news services in Australia if a code is brought in to force the digital platforms to negotiate with news media companies over payment for content. Facebook was not included in any of the ad tech report briefed to media before its release. In the company’s submission to the inquiry last year, it sought to downplay its position in the ad tech sector as “limited”. “We are not vertically integrated: we do not provide publisher ad servers, we do not run publisher-side auctions and we do not independently offer market-wide analytics,” Facebook said."
2021-01-27T11:00:30Z,technology,Technology,Big tech was allowed to spread misinformation unchecked. Will Biden hold them accountable?,"Donald Trump’s election lies and the 6 January attack on the US Capitol have highlighted how big tech has led our society down a path of conspiracies and radicalism by ignoring the mounting evidence that their products are dangerous. But the spread of deadly misinformation on a global scale was enabled by the absence of antitrust enforcement by the federal government to rein in out-of-control monopolies such as Facebook and Google. And there is a real risk social media giants could sidestep accountability once again. Trump’s insistence that he won the election was an attack on democracy that culminated in the attack on the US Capitol. The events were as much the fault of Sundar Pichai, Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg – CEOs of Google, Twitter and Facebook, respectively – as they were the fault of Trump and his cadre of co-conspirators. During the early days of social media, no service operated at the scale of today’s Goliaths. Adoption was limited and online communities lived in small and isolated pockets. When the Egyptian uprisings of 2011 proved the power of these services, the US state department became their cheerleaders, offering them a veneer of exceptionalism which would protect them from scrutiny as they grew exponentially. Later, dictators and anti-democratic actors would study and co-opt these tools for their own purposes. As the megaphones got larger, the voices of bad actors also got louder. As the networks got bigger, the feedback loop amplifying those voices became stronger. It is unimaginable that QAnon could gain a mass following without tech companies’ dangerous indifference. Eventually, these platforms became immune to forces of competition in the marketplace – they became information monopolies with runaway scale. Absent any accountability from watchdogs or the marketplace, fringe conspiracy theories enjoyed unchecked propagation. We can mark networked conspiracies from birtherism to QAnon as straight lines through the same coterie of misinformers who came to power alongside Trump. Today, most global internet activity happens on services owned by either Facebook or Alphabet, which includes YouTube and Google. The internet has calcified into a pair of monopolies who protect their size by optimizing to maximize “engagement”. Sadly, algorithms designed to increase dependency and usage are far more profitable than ones that would encourage timely, local, relevant and, most importantly, accurate information. The truth, in a word, is boring. Facts rarely animate the kind of compulsive engagement rewarded by recommendation and search algorithms. The best tool – if not the only tool – to hold big tech accountable is antitrust enforcement: enforcing the existing antitrust laws designed to rein in companies’ influence over other political, economic and social institutions. Antitrust enforcement has historically been the US government’s greatest weapon against such firms. From breaking up the trusts at the start of the 20th century to the present day, antitrust enforcement spurs competition and ingenuity while re-empowering citizens. Most antitrust historians agree that absent US v Microsoft in 1998, which stopped Microsoft from bundling products and effectively killing off other browsers, the modern internet would have been strangled in the crib.
Ironically, Google and Facebook were the beneficiaries of such enforcement. Over two decades would pass before US authorities brought antitrust suits against Google and Facebook last year. Until then, antitrust had languished as a tool to counterbalance abusive monopolies. Big tech sees an existential threat in the renewed calls for antitrust, and these companies have aggressively lobbied to ensure key vacancies in the Biden administration are filled by their friends. The Democratic party is especially vulnerable to soft capture by these tech firms. Big tech executives are mostly left-leaning and donate millions to progressive causes while spouting feelgood rhetoric of inclusion and connectivity. During the Obama administration, Google and Facebook were treated as exceptional, avoiding any meaningful regulatory scrutiny. Democratic Senate leadership, specifically Senator Chuck Schumer, has recently signaled he will treat these companies with kid gloves. The Biden administration cannot repeat the Obama legacy of installing big tech-friendly individuals to these critical but often under-the-radar roles. The new administration, in consultation with Schumer, will be tasked with appointing a new assistant attorney general for antitrust at the Department of Justice and up to three members of the Federal Trade Commission. Figures friendly to big tech in those positions could abruptly settle the pending litigation against Google or Facebook. President Joe Biden and Schumer must reject any candidate who has worked in the service of big tech. Any former White House or congressional personnel who gave these companies a pass during the Obama administration should also be disqualified from consideration. Allowing big tech’s lawyers and plants to run the antitrust agencies would be the equivalent of allowing a climate-change-denying big oil executive run the Environmental Protection Agency. The public is beginning to recognize the harms to society wrought by big tech and a vibrant and bipartisan anti-monopoly movement with diverse scholars, and activists has risen over the past few years. Two-thirds of Democratic voters believe, along with a majority of Republicans, that Biden should “refuse to appoint executives, lobbyists, or lawyers for these companies to positions of power or influence in his administration while this legal activity is pending”. This gives the Democratic party an opportunity to do the right thing for our country and attract new voters by fighting for the web we want. Big tech played a central role in the dangerous attack on the US Capitol and all of the events which led to it. Biden’s antitrust appointees will be the ones who decide if there are any consequences to be paid.

2021-01-27T10:00:28Z,technology,Technology,Amazon seeks to block workers from voting by mail in landmark union drive,"Amazon is attempting to force workers planning to unionize at an Alabama warehouse to vote in person rather than by mail as it fights off a landmark attempt by its staff to organize. The company is appealing against a ruling by a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) officer to permit 5,800 employees at Amazon’s warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, to begin casting ballots by mail to be represented by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.
The NLRB, the federal agency responsible for enforcing US labor law, favors manual elections but has moved to supporting mail-in ballots during the coronavirus pandemic. Between March and November 2020, 90% of union election representation cases presided by the NLRB were conducted by mail rather than in-person. On Monday the state said there had been 350,988 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Alabama since March and 6,662 confirmed deaths. The appeal was filed on 21 January by attorneys representing Amazon, who argued a mail-in ballot election would take too long and involve too many resources, and requested the board postpone the election until the NLRB reviews Amazon’s appeals. The NLRB is currently scheduled to begin mailing out ballots for the election on 8 February. The union filed their initial petition requesting a union election on 20 November. If successful, Amazon workers at the BHM1 warehouse in Bessemer would be the company’s first warehouse in the United States to unionize. Under the Trump administration, the NLRB halted several mail-in ballot union elections during the pandemic in 2020 to review employer arguments for in-person voting. In April 2020, attorneys for the union avoidance law firm Jackson Lewis asserted in a blogpost that “Mail ballot elections favor unions,” citing the decreased ability of employers to dissuade workers from supporting unionization ahead of an election. Amazon has strongly opposed unionization and organizing efforts throughout its network in the US. In September 2018, an anti-union training video distributed to managers at Amazon-owned Whole Foods was leaked after a group of workers announced the formation of Whole Worker, a group intent on unionizing workers at the grocery chain. During the coronavirus pandemic, several workers at Amazon warehouses have alleged they were fired in retaliation for organizing protests demanding coronavirus safety protections. Recent reports have exposed Amazon’s use of surveillance and heat mapping networks to track labor unions and unionization risks across the US and Europe. Ahead of the Alabama warehouse union election, Amazon launched an anti-union website targeted at its warehouse workers, emphasizing union dues to try to dissuade workers from unionizing. “Don’t buy that dinner, don’t buy those school supplies, don’t buy those gifts because you won’t have that almost $500 you paid in dues. Why not save the money and get the books, gifts, and things you want?” a section of the website claims."
2021-01-27T07:25:08Z,technology,Technology,"Ignore threats to shut search in Australia and force Google to pay, small business groups say","Australia should ignore threats from Google to shut down its search service in the country and press ahead with a code forcing the technology group to pay for news, the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia (Cosboa) says. Cosboa chief executive Peter Strong said Google turning off search in Australia would hurt both small businesses trying to promote themselves and consumers trying to find products. However, Google needed “strong and stringent” regulation due to its monopoly on internet search, he said. Last week Google’s Australian managing director, Mel Silva, told a Senate inquiry the company would shut down its flagship search service in Australia if the government introduced a law that would require it to pay for news content it uses on its website.
Legislation before parliament would introduce a bargaining code forcing digital platforms such as Google and Facebook to negotiate with media companies over payment for news content. If they were unable to agree, they would be sent to an arbitrator who would pick one of the offers made by the sides. Silva told parliament the code, which was developed by competition tsar Rod Sims, would cause “unmanageable financial and operational risk” and that forcing Google to pay for news content would set a dangerous precedent. Strong said the threat highlighted the problem of dealing with one dominant market player – something his members had experience with from dealing with supermarkets and big suppliers. “They’re not evil, they’re just too big,” he said. “We will find ways around this, but some businesses will suffer from it. “What it has highlighted is that if we do have to have a dominant player then that player must respond to regulation and that regulation must be fairly strong and stringent.” He said small business had long had problems with the way Google’s search algorithms worked. “We were getting stories from businesses that were on the front page one day and then the next day they weren’t,” he said. He said that despite Google mounting some “quite sound” arguments against the code, Cosboa supported it. “Good on Rod Sims for doing this,” he said. Former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Allan Fels, who is now the chairman of the Public Interest Journalism Initiative, said he was sceptical about Google’s threat to pull search from Australia. “It’s frequently the case that before ACCC decisions companies that are affected threaten closures, shutdowns, cuts, job losses – but then don’t do it,” he said. “Whether the digital platforms are different remains to be seen.” He said the code had already been amended to take into account concerns expressed by the tech companies. “One supposes that very high in the Google global organisation they have decided to put more pressure on Australia,” he said. He also dismissed the US government’s contention that the code could breach a free trade agreement between the two countries. “It’s dubious that the proposal is in contravention of the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement,” he said. “The code is best understood as a domestic policy aimed at removing gross bargaining imbalances. “It is a conventional use of the Competition Act.” Guardian Australia has been in discussion with Google over inclusion in its new “Showcase” offering that would see the company pay news providers for inclusion in this product."
2021-01-26T16:58:15Z,technology,Technology,"Tory party illegally collected data on ethnicity of 10m voters, MPs told","The Conservative party acted illegally when it collected data on the ethnic backgrounds of 10 million voters before the 2019 general election, the information commissioner has told a committee of MPs. However, Elizabeth Denham insisted there had been no need to issue an enforcement notice against the party, as it had voluntarily deleted the data it held after a “recommendation” from her office. Answering questions at a digital, culture, media and sport select committee meeting on Tuesday morning, Denham said that the Conservatives’ collection of estimated data on voters’ ethnic origin, religion, and country of birth had no legal basis. “We made the recommendation that they destroy the data because they didn’t have a legal basis to collect it,” she said, adding, under sustained questioning from the SNP MP John Nicolson: “It was illegal to collect the ethnicity data.” The breach was first highlighted in November in a report by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), assessing political parties’ compliance with data protection laws. It reported that the Conservatives had purchased so-called estimated onomastic data – which attempts to identify individuals’ ethnic origin, religion, country of birth and other characteristics, based on their first and last names – and appended it to the records of 10 million people. The Conservative party has a history of the controversial use of such data. In 2016, Zac Goldsmith’s Conservative party campaign for London mayor was accused of trying to exploit anti-Muslim sentiment among Hindu, Sikh and Tamil voters as he competed for votes with Labour’s Sadiq Khan, which Goldsmith denied. On Tuesday, Denham faced accusations from Nicolson that the ICO was “weak when it comes to enforcement”. No political party has been served an enforcement notice for its use of data, despite the ICO identifying a number of breaches by parties in its November report. Denham insisted that enforcement had not been necessary after parties voluntary complied with her recommendations. Jim Killock, the executive director of Open Rights Group, called for more clarity on the ICO’s role regarding political data collection. He said: “Elizabeth Denham finally confirmed the unlawful nature of this profiling by the Conservative party under pressure from MPs on the DCMS committee. Yet the ICO still has not explained what parties can and can not do. Mass profiling of voters continues, even if this data has been removed. The ICO needs to act to stop unlawful profiling practices. That’s their job.” Denham’s comments also seemingly contradicted a statement made in parliament by John Whittingdale, the data minister, last month. Questioned by Nicolson in a Commons debate on data protection on 10 December, Whittingdale said of the ICO’s report: “As I recall, the information commissioner examined the practices of all political parties and made comments against all of them. However, it did not find that any breaches of the law had occurred.” Denham would not be drawn into commenting on Whittingdale’s statement. Cat Smith, the shadow voter engagement minister, said: “The Conservative party’s illegal misuse of ethnic race data – a characteristic protected by law – is deeply concerning. “With the government’s discriminatory voter ID laws due to come into law this year, such racial profiling by the party that is in charge of upholding our data protection laws raises serious alarm bells.” A Conservative party spokesperson said: “The Conservative party complies with all prevailing electoral, data protection and electronic marketing legislation. “The party has assisted the Information Commissioner in its review of political parties’ practices and have taken on board the constructive feedback from the review.”"
2021-01-26T16:38:32Z,technology,Technology,UK regulator to write to WhatsApp over Facebook data sharing,"The UK’s data regulator is writing to WhatsApp to demand that the chat app does not hand user data to Facebook, as millions worldwide continue to sign up for alternatives such as Signal and Telegram to avoid forthcoming changes to its terms of service. Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, told a parliamentary committee that in 2017, WhatsApp had committed not to hand any user information over to Facebook until it could prove that doing so respected GDPR. But, she said, that agreement was enforced by the Irish data protection authority until the Brexit transition period ended on 1 January. Now that Britain is fully outside the EU, ensuring that those promises are being kept falls to the Information Commissioner’s Office. “The change in the terms of service, and the requirement of users to share information with Facebook, does not apply to UK users or to users in the EU,” Denham told the digital, culture, media and sport sub-committee on online harms and disinformation, “and that’s because in 2017 my office negotiated with WhatsApp so that they agreed not to share user information and contact information until they could show that they complied with the GDPR.” Asked by the committee chair whether there was any more recent agreement than the 2017 one, however, Denham said there was not. “Up until 1 January, it was the Irish data protection authority’s job to oversee the activity of WhatsApp. As long as we were in the transition period, the one-stop-shop meant it was my Irish colleague who was responsible for WhatsApp. That’s changed now.” The information commissioner also revealed that she uses Signal, a privacy-focused competitor to WhatsApp, for her personal messaging, and does not have an account with either Facebook or WhatsApp. “What’s really interesting about WhatsApp’s announcement on its ongoing sharing with Facebook is how many users voted with their virtual feet and left the platform to take up membership with Telegram or Signal,” she added. “Users expect companies to maintain their trust and not to suddenly change the contract that they have with the users, and I think it’s an example of users being concerned about the trustworthiness and the sustainability of the promises made to users.”
The user exodus from WhatsApp began in early July, when the company announced plans to implement a new privacy policy on 8 February. Those plans, which have now been delayed to early summer, caused substantial panic among the app’s users. Some of the concern was around changes that explicitly spelled out, for the first time, the existing data-sharing arrangements between WhatsApp and Facebook outside the “European region”, which includes the EU and UK. Others were concerned by misinformation, ironically spread on WhatsApp itself, that the new terms of service would allow Facebook to read user messages. That is not the case – the end-to-end encryption applied by WhatsApp prevents Facebook from accessing message contents even if it desired, but the claim spread far enough for WhatsApp to buy advertising declaring: “Neither WhatsApp nor Facebook can read your messages or hear your calls.” Signal and Telegram, the two big beneficiaries of the panic, have added millions of users each in the first three weeks of January. Signal, which was not in the top 1,000 apps in Britain at the beginning of the year, spent several days as the most downloaded app in the country, and has gained 7.5 million users globally."
2021-01-26T16:36:38Z,technology,Technology,Grindr fined Â£8.6m in Norway over sharing personal information,"Grindr has been fined 100m krone (£8.6m) by the Norwegian Data Protection Authority after an investigation revealed the dating app was sharing deeply personal information with advertisers, including location, sexual orientation and mental health details. The fine is 10% of Grindr’s global annual revenue and is particularly high because of the personal nature of the information shared. “This is a milestone in the ongoing work to ensure that consumers’ privacy is protected online. The Data Protection Authority has clearly established that it is unacceptable for companies to collect and share personal data without users’ permission,” said Finn Myrstad, the director of digital policy in Norway’s Consumer Council (NCC). In 2019, the NCC launched a study of the data practices of 10 apps, including period trackers and dating services. At the time, it found that Grindr stood out for the lack of information contained in its privacy policy: the company told users that they needed to check with advertising partners to find out how their data was used, but only listed one such partner, MoPub, an ad network owned by Twitter. Twitter dropped Grindr soon after. Grindr argued that sexual orientation, a specially protected category of data, was not exposed by selling its users’ data, since some of them may be straight. That argument was rejected by the Norwegian authorities, who noted that the app explicitly markets itself as “exclusively for the gay/bi community”. Max Schrems, the chairman of consumer rights group noyb, which supported the case, said the claim was “rather remarkable”. “An app for the gay community, that argues that the special protections for exactly that community actually do not apply to them, is rather remarkable. I am not sure if Grindr’s lawyers have really thought this through.” Ala Krinickytė, a data protection lawyer at noyb, said the fine also created precedent for companies that simple “take it or leave it” terms of service were not sufficient to claim user consent. “The message is simple: ‘take it or leave it’ is not consent. If you rely on unlawful ‘consent’ you are subject to a hefty fine. This does not only concern Grindr, but many websites and apps. “We do not expect any successful objection by Grindr. However, more fines may be in the pipeline for Grindr as it lately claims an unlawful ‘legitimate interest’ to share user data with third parties – even without consent. Grindr may be bound for a second round.” Last June, Grindr attempted to blunt controversy over a different use of user data, after the company committed to removing an “ethnicity filter” from its app to mark its support for the Black Lives Matter movement. The company had long defended the feature, which allowed users to filter out people of particular ethic backgrounds from their search results, even though the company’s head of communications said as far back as 2018 that the option “does promote racist behaviour in the app”. Grindr said: “Grindr is confident that our approach to user privacy is first-in-class among social applications with detailed consent flows, transparency, and control provided to all of our users. For example, Grindr has retained valid legal consent from all of our EEA users on multiple occasions. We most recently required all users to provide consent (again) in late 2020 to align with the GDPR Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) version 2 which was developed by the IAB EU in consultation with the UK ICO. “The allegations from the Norwegian Data Protection Authority date back to 2018 and do not reflect Grindr’s current Privacy Policy or practices. We continually enhance our privacy practices in consideration of evolving privacy laws and regulations, and look forward to entering into a productive dialogue with the Norwegian Data Protection Authority.”"
2021-01-26T00:01:47Z,technology,Technology,Human rights group urges New York to ban police use of facial recognition,"Facial recognition technology amplifies racist policing, threatens the right to protest and should be banned globally, Amnesty International said as it urged New York City to pass a ban on its use in mass surveillance by law enforcement. “Facial recognition risks being weaponised by law enforcement against marginalised communities around the world,” said Matt Mahmoudi, AI and human rights researcher at Amnesty. “From New Delhi to New York, this invasive technology turns our identities against us and undermines human rights. “New Yorkers should be able to go out about their daily lives without being tracked by facial recognition. Other major cities across the US have already banned facial recognition, and New York must do the same.”
Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project at New York’s Urban Justice Centre, which is supporting Amnesty’s Ban the Scan campaign, said: “Facial recognition is biased, broken, and antithetical to democracy. “For years, the [New York police department] has used facial recognition to track tens of thousands of New Yorkers, putting New Yorkers of colour at risk of false arrest and police violence. Banning facial recognition won’t just protect civil rights: it’s a matter of life and death.” In tests for racial bias, facial recognition technology has repeatedly come up short. In 2016, a team at Georgetown University analysed more than 10,000 pages of documents on the use of the technology by US police departments. It found that the departments were applying the technology to databases that were “disproportionately African American”, even while using software that was particularly bad at recognising black faces. In another study, the American Civil Liberties Union fed photos of members of Congress into Amazon’s facial recognition tool, Rekognition, and asked it to find those matched with a mugshot database. The system returned 28 matches, “disproportionately of people of colour”. Initially, Amnesty will ask New Yorkers to file official comments on NYPD use of facial recognition, under the Public Oversight of Surveillance Technologies Act, passed by the city last summer, which required police to disclose their use of surveillance tech by 12 January this year, and provided a 45-day window for public comment. Amnesty will also help New Yorkers generate freedom of information requests to see where facial recognition technology is being used, and run an open-source intelligence campaign to spot and tag facial-recognition-capable cameras. Eventually, the organisation said, it hopes to make the campaign global. Amnesty is calling “for a total ban on the use, development, production and sale of facial recognition technology for mass surveillance purposes by the police and other government agencies and calling for a ban on exports of the technology systems”. It is not alone in calling for the technology to be banned from law enforcement, nor in highlighting the risks of racial discrimination and suppression of the right to protest. In March, the UK Equality and Human Rights Commission said use of the technology should be suspended until its impact had been independently scrutinised and laws regulating its application actively passed. “The law is clearly on the back foot with invasive [automated facial recognition] and predictive policing technologies,” said EHRC chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath. “It is essential that their use is suspended until robust, independent impact assessments and consultations can be carried out, so that we know exactly how this technology is being used and are reassured that our rights are being respected.”"
2021-01-25T21:42:25Z,technology,Technology,Birdwatch: Twitter pilot will allow users to flag misinformation,"Twitter will allow users to flag and annotate misleading or inaccurate tweets in ongoing efforts to address misinformation on the platform. The pilot program, called Birdwatch, is being tested in the United States, the social media firm said in a blogpost. It comes as calls to better combat misinformation on social media have grown substantially in recent years, particularly surrounding the 2020 presidential election. Twitter in the past year started adding labels and warnings about misinformation on the site, including about the Covid-19 pandemic and the US election. It permanently banned Donald Trump in the days leading up to the inauguration of his successor after the former president’s use of Twitter was seen to praise or enable the storming of the Capitol on 6 January. Executives of the platform, along with those of other big tech firms, have been called to testify in front of Congress multiple times in the past year to answer for issues that include misinformation as well as the reach of big tech’s influence and power. Following its launch, Birdwatch can be found on a separate section of Twitter – twitter.com/i/birdwatch – and pilot participants who apply to the program can write posts identifying and rebutting misinformation. Their notes will initially not be visible on Twitter for users outside the pilot group but will be visible on the Birdwatch site. Twitter said it expects to have between 1,000 and 100,000 Birdwatchers who are being admitted on a rolling basis and who will not be paid. In the blogpost, the Twitter vice-president of product, Keith Coleman, said the notes will ultimately be visible to the global Twitter audience. “We know there are a number of challenges toward building a community-driven system like this – from making it resistant to manipulation attempts to ensuring it isn’t dominated by a simple majority or biased based on its distribution of contributors,” said Coleman in the blogpost. Pilot participants can rate the helpfulness of notes from other contributors. “We believe this is a model worth trying,” he said. Some have criticized Twitter for delegating the important task of moderating questionable content to unpaid users. But others say it could be a step in the right direction. Evan Greer, the director of online activist group Fight for the Future said the effectiveness of the program will depend largely on how, exactly, it is carried out. “There is definitely a need for creative thinking when it comes to addressing disinformation beyond just ‘let’s censor more things’. And it makes sense to explore more decentralized models rather than giving more power to big tech companies,” she said. “That said, as always the devil is in the details. Twitter and other companies should consult with experts and members of impacted communities as they craft their policies and experiment with possible solutions to complex problems.” Reuters contributed to this report"
2021-01-25T17:37:56Z,technology,Technology,Google announces plan to tackle privacy issues in online advertising,"Google has announced a plan to tackle privacy issues in online advertising, as the company attempts to chart a middle ground between Apple’s privacy-first approach and the needs of advertisers – including itself. Google will use AI to bundle an individual user with similar visitors in an attempt to convince users that they don’t need to block all tracking on the internet to preserve their privacy. It will also use a “trusted server” to store adverts without needing to connect to hundreds of providers across the wider web, and cryptography to ensure that advertisers only find out the information they need to pay websites. “We believe that the notion that ‘it’s privacy or it’s advertising’ is a false choice,” said Chetna Bindra, Google’s head of user trust and privacy for advertising. “We really do believe there is a way to meet user expectations, and protect their identity, while allowing for ad supported content.” Google says it will shortly begin to experiment in Chrome, its browser, with how to actually do that. A new “privacy sandbox” bundles together five proposals with bird-themed code-names including Floc (federated learning of cohorts), Fledge (first “locally-executed decision over groups” experiment) and turtledove (two uncorrelated requests, then locally-executed decision on victory), which explore various ways with letting advertisers continue to target ads on the internet, but without the vast surveillance ecosystem that exists to support that.
It’s an approach that differs from the simpler option selected by Apple for Safari: just block all the surveillance. Bindra said there are multiple reasons why the company went a different route. One is that Google has a more rosy view than its competitor of the importance of advertising. “We do believe that ads play a major role in making the internet an accessible and open place,” she said, specifically siting the need for marketers “to connect with people interested in what they have to offer”. But that optimism is paired with a pessimistic view of what blocking surveillance actually means: an arms race between the blockers and the blocked. “A large focus of this effort has been to ensure the ad industry is not being driven towards workarounds for their business where they’re actually circumventing true user privacy,” Bindra said. “We’ve certainly seen that happen over the last couple of years, where companies have leaned into things like fingerprinting and other alternative techniques to be able to work around the absence of third party cookies in certain browsers.” But whatever Google does to online advertising, the company walks a tightrope. With Chrome’s share of the browser market and Google’s share of the online advertising market, it has to keep one eye on the Competition and Markets Authority, which has already announced plans to try to limit Google’s power. At the same time, it needs to satisfy the Information Commissioner’s Office, which has launched its own investigation into privacy in the adtech ecosystem."
2021-01-25T07:00:09Z,technology,Technology,Sony WH-1000XM4 review: Bose-beating noise cancelling headphones,"Sony’s top of the line noise-cancelling headphones have long had a winning formula and the latest edition has a much-requested addition – multiple device connectivity – to make them the best of class. The WH-1000XM4 have an RRP of £350 and on initial inspection little has changed for the fourth edition of the 1000X line, with its understated design. The high-quality plastic body is well made and lightweight at 254g but doesn’t feel as premium as some metal or carbon fibre competitors that weigh more than 300g. They are some of the lightest-feeling headphones you can buy, matching the longstanding comfort kings, the Bose QC35 II. The ear cups are well padded with a gentle, even pressure on the side of your head while a soft leatherette headband sits on your dome. It’s easy to forget you are wearing them apart from when the headband slips forward when you tilt your head to look down.
Specifications Weight: 254g Drivers: 40mm Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.0 with multipoint, 3.5mm, USB-C charging, NFC Bluetooth codecs: SBC, AAC, LDAC Battery life: 30 hours ANC on Controls and connectivity
The XM4 are a regular set of Bluetooth 5.0 headphones, making them compatible with most Bluetooth-sporting phones, tablets, computers and other devices. They support the universal SBC and AAC audio formats used by most devices. But they also support Sony’s high-resolution LDAC Bluetooth audio format that is compatible with many Android devices for some of the highest-quality wireless audio. They are Sony’s first 1000X set to support the popular multipoint connection feature, which means you can have two devices connected at the same time, such as a phone for calls and a laptop for music. It works reliably with a variety of devices. The high-resolution LDAC audio cannot be used when multipoint is enabled, however, restricting connections to the more standard SBC and AAC. There are four ways to pair the headphones – Google’s Fast Pair or via a single tap with an NFC tag for instant pairing with an Android phone, using the Sony Headphones Connect app for Android or the iPhone and iPad, and manual pairing the old-fashioned way by holding down a button. The headphones come with a standard 3.5mm headphones cable that can be used when the headphones are turned on or off. The microphone cannot be used over the 3.5mm cable, however. The left ear cup has a power button and a custom action button, which can be set to control either Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa or noise-cancelling. The right ear cup has a touch pad for the rest of the controls, which work well with bare fingers but not with gloves. Double tap for pause/play, swipe forward or back for track skip, and up and down for volume. Tap and hold for Siri or Google Assistant from your phone. Hold your palm over the touchpad to quickly switch to an ambient listening mode, which is extremely handy for announcements and quick conversations.
The Headphones Connect app for Android and iOS handles various settings and updates, including switching connected devices, noise-cancelling modes and sound options. The XM4 have five mics for picking up your voice and are slightly improved compared with previous versions, with callers able to hear what I was saying in areas with a little background noise, but still do not compare with the class-leading Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700.

The XM4 have some of the best active noise-cancelling technology available, with a level of control that goes beyond most, effectively reducing most droning and low-frequency sound as well as some speech and other more sudden noise, matching the best from Bose. Using the app you can personalise the noise-cancelling to take into account hair, glasses and other things that effect the seal of the ear cups, while a pressure optimiser that can determine whether you are on the ground or in the air helps when flying versus just the commute. In addition, there are the ambient sound modes, which adjust the amount of background noise you can hear over 20 levels, plus a “focus on voice” for allowing speech through. It doesn’t rival Apple’s version in sounding as if you’re not wearing the headphones, but is good for awareness. Adaptive sound control in the app can automatically adjust the level of noise-cancelling based on how loud it is in your current environment. The system learns your favourite locations and awareness levels, and switches automatically, such as maximum noise-cancelling at work but ambient sound level 10 at home. Fantastic sound
These are some of the best-sounding Bluetooth headphones you can buy, producing the sort of audio that has you discovering new nuances in well-worn tracks, putting them in the same league as the B&W PX7 and Apple’s AirPods Max. They are not neutral, with a default sound that is more mid-bass heavy than some competitors, but they produce well-controlled, deep and full bass, warm mids and sparkling high notes. Unlike many rivals, they have a full equaliser in the app to customise the sound to your liking, as well as music enhancement systems such as Sony’s DSEE Extreme upscale audio to revive tones lost because of compression at the expense of battery life. They do an excellent job of bringing the best out of most music genres, from pounding bass lines in high-energy electronica and a raw energy in grunge to sumptuous tones for jazz and soul and a wide sound profile for grand orchestral scores. Preservation of detail even in super complex tracks is top notch, while they also sound great for movie soundtracks, with vocals preserved over the top of powerful bass. Battery life
The headphones last for up to 30 hours between charges with noise cancelling turned on, which is 10 hours longer than many competitors. Turn it off and they last up to 38 hours or 22 hours with the ambient sound mode active. They last up to 24 hours of voice calling, too. The headphones take three hours to fully charge via the USB-C port in the right ear cup using a 1.5A power adaptor, which isn’t included in the box. A 10-minute charge provides up to five hours of playback if you’re in a hurry. Sustainability Sony does not provide an estimate of the number of full-charge cycles the battery should last. Batteries in similar devices can typically last for 500 cycles while maintaining at least 80% of their original capacity. The battery can be replaced by an authorised service centre costing £39.46 plus £12 shipping out of warranty. The headphones are generally repairable (iFixit teardown), and replacement parts, including the earpads, headband and mainboard are available. Sony did not comment on the use of recycled materials and does not publish environmental impact reports for headphones. It publishes annual sustainability reports and its roadmap to have zero environmental impact by 2050. Observations Google Assistant can read notifications on Android and iOS, while Alexa is also an option or you can use your phone’s voice assistant such as Siri on an iPhone. Press the power button when the headphones are on to hear the battery percentage. They support 360 Reality Audio for certain music services such as Tidal and Deezer. The Speak-to-Chat function detects when you’re speaking loudly enough and automatically enables an ambient sound mode so you can carry out a conversation. Price The Sony WH-1000XM4 cost £350 in black or silver. For comparison, the RRP of Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 is £349.95, the Bose QuietComfort 35 II cost £299.95, the B&W PX7 cost £349.99, Apple AirPods Max cost £549, the Master and Dynamic MW65 cost £449 and the B&O Beoplay H95 cost £700. Verdict The Sony WF-1000XM4 are some of the best noise-cancelling wireless headphones money can buy. They sound fantastic, have effective noise-cancelling and long battery life. They support multipoint Bluetooth 5 for connecting two devices at once, high-res music with the LDAC format and an instant ambient sound mode for listening for announcements, too. They are also some of the lightest and most comfortable headphones you can buy, matching the long-term wearing comfort of the Bose QC35 II. They don’t look and feel quite as solid or premium as some competitors but they fold up for travel and appear durable in lightweight plastic. The are also fairly easy to repair and the battery is replaceable for a reasonable sum. Call quality is average. Note that unlike most rivals, the WF-1000XM4 are often available at a discount on their RRP, so it’s worth shopping around. Pros: brilliant sound, excellent noise-cancelling, lightweight comfort, can connect to two devices at once, hi-res music support, long battery life, good controls, good ambient modes, 3.5mm headphone socket, fold up with good case, repairable, cross-platform companion app. Cons: expensive, voice mic is hit and miss, don’t feel as premium as rivals.

2021-01-24T17:31:16Z,technology,Technology,Insurers 'funding organised crime' by paying ransomware claims,"Insurers are inadvertently funding organised crime by paying out claims from companies who have paid ransoms to regain access to data and systems after a hacking attack, Britain’s former top cybersecurity official has warned. Ciaran Martin, who ran the National Cyber Security Centre until last August, said he feared that so-called ransomware was “close to getting out of control” and that there was a risk that NHS systems could be hit during the pandemic. The problem, he said, is being fuelled because there is no legal barrier to companies paying ransoms to cyber gangs – typically from Russia and some other former Soviet states – and claiming back on insurance. “People are paying bitcoin to criminals and claiming back cash,” Martin said. “I see this as so avoidable. At the moment, companies have incentives to pay ransoms to make sure this all goes away,” the former intelligence chief said. “You have to look seriously about changing the law on insurance and banning these payments, or at the very least, having a major consultation with the industry”. Britain’s extortion laws prohibit the payment of ransoms to terrorists, and were drawn up largely in response to the threat of kidnapping. But cyber-attacks are not carried out by terror groups, and so there is no bar to paying ransom demands – and it is possible to make an insurance claim if no personal data was involved. Criminal hacking groups tend to be based in Russia and former Soviet states outside the Baltic region, Martin said, operating while the Kremlin and other governments in the region turn a blind eye to their activities. Some groups claim they have made so much money they are publicly announcing their “retirement” on line, while the Wizard Spider or RYUK gang is estimated to have made $150m from online extortion according to a study of bitcoin transactions. So called ransomware attacks involve groups hacking into and seizing control of corporate data systems. The gangs demand money – typically up to $10m a time – to give back access to the systems. “Attackers often set great store in being reliable once you have paid them, providing testimony from involuntary customers,” Martin said. Travelex, a UK-based provider of foreign exchange services, paid $2.3m last year to regain control after hackers shut down its networks, but the company subsequently fell into administration and had to be restructured with the loss of 1,300 jobs. Smartwatch maker Garmin also reportedly paid to recover files, after suffering a crippling attack last summer. Criminal attackers say they will not target hospitals or health centres, believing that such an attack would have wider diplomatic repercussions. But Martin said the worry is that IT systems do not readily identify themselves online, so a mistaken attack with wider consequences remains possible. In 2017, NHS systems were among those seriously disrupted by the WannaCry attack, which emerged from North Korea. Although not a ransomware attack, the disruption caused to hospital systems demonstrates how serious the health sector could be affected in the UK and elsewhere. German police launched an investigation in September after a woman died during a cyber-attack on a hospital in Dusseldorf. Doctors had been attempting to transfer the patient to another facility 30km away. Other recent ransomware attacks have been conducted against EuroFins, a Belgian company that provides forensic services and disrupted police investigations in England and Wales, and elsewhere for some months although this was not widely reported at the time. It too reportedly paid a ransom. Gangs often scout their targets and will tailor their demands to the size of the customer – there are even examples of small businesses such as hairdressers being targeted and payments of £1,500 being demanded. Companies who have effective backups and can otherwise shrug off a hacker attack also find themselves under pressure to pay, because gangs are now threatening to leak stolen data online, an evolution of the classic ransomware model. Martin said it was difficult to track the level of ransomware activity, because there was a lack of disclosure obligations, unless personal data is involved. But he added that he regretted not being able to change the law during his time in government and action was needed soon. “In the last year, experts are saying this is close to getting out of control,” the former intelligence agency chief said. “The law is nobody’s fault, it was written for another purpose, but it has become OK to pay out to criminals”."
2021-01-24T16:53:28Z,technology,Technology,WhatsApp loses millions of users after terms update,"A poorly explained update to its terms of service has pushed WhatsApp users to adopt alternative services such as Signal and Telegram in their millions. The exodus was so large that WhatsApp has been forced to delay the implementation of the new terms, which had been slated for 8 February, and run a damage limitation campaign to explain to users the changes they were making. Over the first three weeks of January, Signal has gained 7.5 million users globally, according to figures shared by the UK parliament’s home affairs committee, and Telegram has gained 25 million. In both cases, the increase appears to have come at WhatsApp’s expense. Data tracked by the analytics firm App Annie shows WhatsApp falling from the eighth most downloaded app in the UK at the beginning of the month to the 23rd by 12 January. By contrast, Signal wasn’t even in the top 1,000 apps in the UK on 6 January, yet by 9 January it was the most downloaded app in the country. Niamh Sweeney, WhatsApp’s director of public policy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told the home affairs committee that the exodus was believed to be related to the update to the company’s terms of service. She said that update was intended to do two things: enable a new set of features around business messaging, and “make clarifications and provide greater transparency” around the company’s pre-existing policies. “There are no changes to our data sharing with Facebook anywhere in the world,” Sweeney said. But after viral posts – ironically, widely spread on WhatsApp – claimed that the privacy policy instead gave the service the right to read users’ messages and hand the information over to its parent company Facebook, WhatsApp announced a delay in the implementation of the new terms of service. “We want to be clear that the policy update does not affect the privacy of your messages with friends or family in any way,” WhatsApp said in an update posted to its site, which it is paying to advertise on Google under searches for “WhatsApp privacy policy”. The company says it will delay the implementation of its new policy until 15 May. App Annie’s director of market insights, Amir Ghodrati, said moving quickly was important. “These types of shifts in messaging and social networking apps are not unusual. Due to the nature of social apps and how the primary functionality involves communicating with others, their growth can often move quite quickly, based on current events. We’ve seen growing demand over the last few years for encrypted messaging and apps focused on privacy.” The shift to more privacy-focused messaging apps had been building before WhatsApp’s public relations disaster, Ghodrati said. “Messaging apps that provide privacy features saw the greatest engagement growth in [the first half of] 2020. These apps saw on average 30% more active users than the alternatives. Apps like Signal, Telegram, Wickr, and WhatsApp offer privacy features ranging from end-to-end encrypted data transfer to ‘self-destructing messages’.” Ironically, in some ways WhatsApp is more privacy-focused than its competitor Telegram. The former applies end-to-end encryption – which prevents the service provider from being able to access user messages – by default to every chat except those between users and large businesses. Telegram, however, only turns on end-to-end encryption for “secret chats”, an option that users must actively select for each individual contact. Such chats “are meant for people who want more secrecy than the average fella”, the service explains in an FAQ."
2021-01-24T07:00:39Z,technology,Technology,Is it time to leave WhatsApp – and is Signal the answer?,"Earlier this month, WhatsApp issued a new privacy policy along with an ultimatum: accept these new terms, or delete WhatsApp from your smartphone. But the new privacy policy wasn’t particularly clear, and it was widely misinterpreted to mean WhatsApp would be sharing more sensitive personal data with its parent company Facebook. Unsurprisingly, it prompted a fierce backlash, with many users threatening to stop using the service. WhatsApp soon issued a clarification, explaining that the new policy only affects the way users’ accounts interact with businesses (ie not with their friends) and does not mandate any new data collection. The messaging app also delayed the introduction of the policy by three months. Crucially, WhatsApp said, the new policy doesn’t affect the content of your chats, which remain protected by end-to-end encryption – the “gold standard” of security that means no one can view the content of messages, even WhatsApp, Facebook, or the authorities. But the damage had already been done. The bungled communication attempts have raised awareness that WhatsApp does collect a lot of data, and some of this could be shared with Facebook. The BBC reported that Signal was downloaded 246,000 times worldwide in the week before WhatsApp announced the change on 4 January, and 8.8m times the week after.
WhatsApp does share some data with Facebook, including phone numbers and profile name, but this has been happening for years. WhatsApp has stated that in the UK and EU the update does not share further data with Facebook – because of strict privacy regulation, known as the general update to data protection regulation (GDPR). The messaging app doesn’t gather the content of your chats, but it does collect the metadata attached to them – such as the sender, the time a message was sent and who it was sent to. This can be shared with “Facebook companies”. Facebook’s highly criticised data collection ethos has eroded trust in the social network. Its practices can put vulnerable people at risk, says Emily Overton, a data protection expert and managing director of RMGirl. She cites the example of Facebook’s “people you may know” algorithm exposing sex workers’ real names to their clients – despite both parties taking care to set up fake identities. “The more data they profile, the more they put people in vulnerable positions at risk.” And the social network isn’t known for keeping promises. When Facebook bought WhatsApp in 2014, it pledged to keep the two services separate. Yet only a few years later, Facebook announced aims to integrate the messaging systems of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. This appears to have stalled owing to technical and regulatory difficulties around encryption, but it’s still the long-term plan. * * * Why are people choosing Signal over Telegram? Signal, a secure messaging app recommended by authorities such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Edward Snowden, has been the main beneficiary of the WhatsApp exodus. Another messaging app, Telegram, has also experienced an uptick in downloads, but Signal has been topping the charts on the Apple and Android app stores. Signal benefits from being the most similar to WhatsApp in terms of features, while Telegram has had problems as a secure and private messaging app, with its live location feature recently coming under fire for privacy infringements. Crucially, Telegram is not end-to-end encrypted by default, instead storing your data in the cloud. Signal is end-to-end encrypted, collects less data than Telegram and stores messages on your device rather than in the cloud. * * * Does Signal have all the features I am used to and why is it more private? Yes, Signal has most of the features you are used to on WhatsApp, such as stickers and emojis. You can set up and name groups, and it’s easy to send a message: just bring up the pen sign in the right-hand corner.
Signal has a desktop app, and you can voice and video chat with up to eight people. Like WhatsApp, Signal uses your phone number as your identity, something that has concerned some privacy and security advocates. However, the company has introduced pin codes in the hope of moving to a more secure and private way of identifying users in the future. As well as being end-to-end encrypted, both WhatsApp and Signal have a “disappearing messages” feature for additional privacy. The major difference is how each app is funded. WhatsApp is owned by Facebook, whose business model is based on advertising. Signal is privacy focused and has no desire to analyse, share or profit from users’ private information, says Jake Moore, cybersecurity specialist at ESET. Signal is supported by the non-profit Signal Foundation, set up in 2018 by WhatsApp founder Brian Acton and security researcher (and Signal Messenger CEO) Moxie Marlinspike, who created an encryption protocol that is used by several messaging services, including WhatsApp and Skype as well as Signal itself. Acton, who left Facebook in 2017 after expressing concerns over how the company operated, donated an initial $50m to Signal, and the open-source app is now funded by the community. Essentially that means developers across the world will continually work on it and fix security issues as part of a collaborative effort, making the app arguably more secure. But there are concerns over whether Signal can maintain this free model as its user base increases to the tens, or potentially in the future, hundreds of millions. Signal is adamant it can continue to offer its service for free. “As a non-profit, we simply need to break even,” says Aruna Harder, the app’s COO. Signal is exclusively supported by grants and donations, says Acton. “We believe that millions of people value privacy enough to sustain it, and we’re here to demonstrate that there is an alternative to the ad-based business models that exploit user privacy.” * * * I want to move to Signal. How do you persuade WhatsApp groups to switch? The momentum away from WhatsApp does appear to be building, and you may find more of your friends have switched to Signal already. But persuading a larger contact group can be more challenging. Overton has been using Signal for several years and says all her regular contacts use the app. “Even when dating online, I ask the person I want to go on a date with to download Signal, or they don’t get my number.” Some Signal advocates have already begun to migrate their groups over from WhatsApp. Jim Creese, a security expert, is moving a neighbourhood text group of 100 people to Signal. He is starting with a smaller sub-group of 20, some of whom struggle with technology. Creese says most are ambivalent about switching “as long as the new method isn’t more difficult”.
He advises anyone who’s moving groups across apps to focus on the “why” first. “Explain the reasons for the change, how it is likely to affect them, and the benefits. Don’t rush the process. While WhatsApp might not be where you want to be today, there’s no emergency requiring an immediate move.” Moore thinks the shift away from WhatsApp will continue to gain momentum, but he says it will take time to move everyone across. Until then, it’s likely you will need to keep both WhatsApp and Signal on your phone. Moore is in the process of moving a family chat to Signal, for the second time. “When I originally tried, one family member didn’t understand my concerns and thought I was being overcautious. “However, the recent news has helped him understand the potential issues and why moving isn’t such a bad idea. The next hurdle will be getting my mother to download a new app and use it for the first time without me physically assisting her.”"
2021-01-24T02:20:12Z,technology,Technology,"'Inevitable' Google and Facebook will pay for Australian news, treasurer says","Josh Frydenberg has warned the internet giants it is “inevitable” they will pay for news content and their threats to shut down core functions in Australia do them a “big disservice”. At a doorstop on Sunday, the treasurer said the Morrison’s government intended to become a “world leader” in regulating social media and search companies, who he accused of shifting the goalposts in their opposition to the proposed bargaining code of conduct.
Google and Facebook are both fighting against legislation currently before the parliament that would force them to enter into negotiations with news media companies for payment for content, with an arbiter to ultimately decide the payment amount if no agreement can be reached. On Friday, the pair escalated the dispute by threatening to remove the Google search engine from Australia and Facebook to remove news from the Facebook feeds of all Australian users. The threats follow the revelation that Google has been experimenting with hiding some Australian news sites from search results, in a move media outlets said was a show of “extraordinary power”. Frydenberg told reporters in Melbourne the government had worked with the Australian competition regulator for two years developing the code to “see the digital giants pay for original content that is generated by our media businesses”. Frydenberg accused the tech companies of “changing the goalposts” by first opposing the government’s proposal of final offer arbitration and now opposing paying for clicks on media content displayed in search results. He said “if the clicks for media content is such a small proportion of their overall clicks on the search” that would be reflected in the payment determined by the independent arbiter. Frydenberg noted the government’s position was supported by media companies and public polling, after a Dynata poll conducted for the Australia Institute’s Centre for Responsible Technology found that four in five respondents found it “disturbing” that Australian results could be removed from news feeds. “It seems that digital giants did themselves a big disservice last week when they very openly and publicly threatened the Australian public with pulling out of Australia effectively with search if legislation proceeds as it currently stands,” Frydenberg said. The treasurer said crossbenchers and the Australian Greens had spoken in support of the code, but accused Labor of “getting splinters sitting on the fence”.
“My view is that it is inevitable that the digital giants will be paying for original content and the choice for Australia, is: are we world leaders … and first off the rank when it comes to putting in place such a code? Or we can follow others further down the track when they do it.” Facebook has called the code unworkable in its current form, and has asked for digital platforms to be given six months’ grace to negotiate deals with news companies directly before being hit with the “big stick” of the mandatory code. Google has said it could accept arbitration as a “reasonable backstop” to secure investment in news but Australia’s model is flawed because it considers only news companies’ costs and not Google’s – and encourages “ambit claims”. On Friday Google struck a deal with a group of French publishers to pay for news through its News Showcase program, which is not overseen by independent arbitration. Note: Guardian Australia has been in discussion with Google over inclusion in its new “Showcase” offering that would see the company pay news providers for inclusion in this product."
2021-01-22T16:47:50Z,technology,Technology,Google threatens to leave Australia – but its poker face is slipping,"The biggest companies in technology love an ultimatum but rarely do they spell out their threats. This week, however, Google has done exactly that, telling an Australian parliamentary hearing that a proposed law forcing the company to pay news publishers for the right to link to their content “would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia”. The threat, from the company’s Australian managing director, Mel Silva, is the latest escalation in a war of words over the proposal, which seeks to undo some of the damage online business models have dealt to the country’s publishing industry. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, told a press conference “we don’t respond to threats”. But Google’s warning is hardly unusual in an industry that is loathe to encourage countries to go it alone when it comes to sweeping regulation. Last September, for example, Facebook told an Irish court that it may have to pull out of the European market entirely if a court judgment banning data flows between the US and UK was upheld. “In the event that [Facebook] were subject to a complete suspension of the transfer of users’ data to the US,” the company’s associate general counsel argued, “it is not clear … how, in those circumstances, it could continue to provide the Facebook and Instagram services in the EU.” Similarly, tech companies have been warning for years that a UK attempt to regulate end-to-end encryption could lead to their messaging services being unfeasible to offer in Britain. But rarely do governments hold their nerve for long enough for the threats to be uttered loudly and clearly. Facebook, for instance, rowed back its warning to the Irish court in press statements, saying it was merely “setting out the simple reality”; and those messaging services are happy to mutter warnings in private, but have not yet seen the need to stick their head above the parapet for a knock-down battle. Australia, though, has a knack for picking fights. It already had one such standoff with Amazon after sales tax changes in 2018 meant the company refused to ship imports to Australia in order to avoid collecting tax on those purchases. But that felt like a win-win for some Australians, closing a tax loophole and boosting local retailers at the same time. The loss of Google’s search engine may be felt more keenly. Google has followed through on similar threats in the past. Spanish users cannot access Google News to this day, after a law in the country intended to force Google to pay newspapers for excerpting links and headlines instead resulted in the company simply removing its news product. The Australian law, by contrast, seeks to avoid Google taking the easy way out. By requiring payments for any links to news, even on the main search engine – and by covering Facebook as well – the country hopes to succeed in extracting revenue from Google, regardless of its threats. Unfortunately for Google, the company has a bad poker face. Even as it was warning Australian senators that it would have to pull out of the country rather than pay the newly levied fee, on the other side of the world in France, Google had agreed to do just that. In an agreement signed between Google France and the industrial body representing the country’s news industry, Google will pay licensing fees to individual news publishers to reuse their material online. Backed by France’s strong copyright protections for the news industry, Google had already negotiated with a few publishers, including Le Monde, but the new agreement sets a blanket precedent. “Withdrawing our services from Australia is the last thing that Google want to have happen, especially when there is another way forward,” Silva told Australian senators on Friday. It might pretend it has not, but in France the company has already discovered that other way forward. And thanks to Google Translate, you don’t even need to speak French to read it for yourself. In a statement, Google later said: “We have offered (and agreed) similar deals for News Showcase in Australia as in France and many other countries around the world. In Australia, it’s not about the money; it’s about being asked to pay for all links and snippets which the European Copyright Directive does not. Links and snippets are the building blocks of the free and open web. Sir Tim Berners Lee in his submission agrees.” Note: Guardian Australia has been in discussion with Google over inclusion in its new “Showcase” offering that would see the company pay news providers for inclusion in this product."
2021-01-21T20:06:08Z,technology,Technology,US lawmakers ask FBI to investigate Parler app's role in Capitol attack,"American lawmakers have asked the FBI to investigate the role of Parler, the social media website and app popular with the American far right, in the violence at the US Capitol on 6 January. Carolyn Maloney, chair of the House oversight and reform Committee, asked the FBI to review Parler’s role “as a potential facilitator of planning and incitement related to the violence, as a repository of key evidence posted by users on its site, and as a potential conduit for foreign governments who may be financing civil unrest in the United States”. Maloney asked the FBI to review Parler’s financing and its ties to Russia.
Maloney cited press reports that detailed violent threats on Parler against state elected officials for their role in certifying the election results before the 6 January attack that left five dead. She also noted numerous Parler users have been arrested and charged with threatening violence against elected officials or for their roles in the attack. She cited justice department charges against a Texas man who used a Parler account to post threats that he would return to the Capitol on 19 January “carrying weapons and massing in numbers so large that no army could match them”. The justice department said the threats were viewed by other social media users tens of thousands of times. Parler was launched in 2018 and won more users in the last months of the Trump presidency as social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook cracked down more forcefully on falsehoods and misinformation. The social network, which resembles Twitter, fast became the hottest app among American conservatives, with high-profile proponents like Senator Ted Cruz recruiting new users. But following the 6 January insurrection at the US Capitol, Google banned it from Google Play and Apple suspended it from the App Store.
Amazon then suspended Parler from its web hosting service AWS, in effect taking the site offline unless it could find a new company to host its services. The website partially returned online this week, though only displaying a message from its chief executive, John Matze, saying he was working to restore functionality, with the help of a Russian-owned technology company. Reuters reported this week that Parler partially resumed online operations. The FBI and Parler did not immediately respond to requests for comment. More than 25,000 national guard troops and new fencing ringed with razor wire were among the unprecedented security steps put in place ahead of Wednesday’s inauguration of President Joe Biden."
2021-01-21T16:00:05Z,technology,Technology,Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra review: the new king of Android phones,"The Galaxy S21 Ultra is Samsung’s new superphone for 2021 – and comes out firmly as the best of its type, with a price to match. Equipped with a new more powerful camera system – with not one but two optical zoom lenses on the back for a huge 10x optical zoom – it costs from £1,149 and leads Samsung’s 2021 mobile line, which also includes the smaller and cheaper £769 S21 and £819 S21+. The Galaxy S21 Ultra looks broadly the same as its predecessors – all-screen on the front, aluminium sides and a glass back. The most distinctive change is a large camera lump blending into the side.
The 6.8in screen is marginally smaller than the Note 20 Ultra and S20 Ultra from last year, but is crisp, colour rich and super bright. If you want big-screen entertainment in your pocket it delivers while its 120Hz refresh rate (double that on an iPhone) makes scrolling through feeds super smooth. The S21 Ultra is a very large and relatively heavy oversized phone putting it in competition with the Note 20 Ultra and iPhone 12 Pro Max. I could just about use it with one hand, but most will need two hands to use it safely without using some form of phone grip.
Specifications Main screen: 6.8in QHD+ Dynamic Amoled 2X (515ppi) 120Hz Processor: Samsung Exynos 2100 (EU) or Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 (US) RAM: 12 or 16GB of RAM Storage: 128, 256 or 512GB Operating system: One UI 3.1 based on Android 11 Camera: Quad rear camera: 108MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide, 10MP 3x and 10MP 10x telephoto, laser autofocus; 40MP front-facing camera Connectivity: 5G, dual nano sim, USB-C, wifi 6E, NFC, Bluetooth 5, UWB and location Water resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 mins) Dimensions: 165.1 x 75.6 x 8.9mm Weight: 227g 35 hours of battery life
The S21 Ultra ships with Samsung’s just-released Exynos 2100 processor in Europe (as tested) or Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 in the US. Both variants come with 12GB or 16GB of RAM depending on model. Performance was excellent all-round. The S21 Ultra feels noticeably snappier than the Note 20 Ultra from last year; from unlocking the phone to launching apps, every action happens just a little bit quicker. Battery life is also strong. The phone easily outlasts a full day of heavy usage. I get in excess of 35 hours between charges – 7am on day 1 until 6pm on day 2 – with my general usage, which includes more than 5.5 hours of screen-on time split between chat apps, Chrome, Gmail, Evernote, the Guardian, Spotify and many others, shooting about 15 photos and spending about three hours on 5G, the rest on wifi. That is longer than the 30-hour battery of the Note 20 Ultra, but slightly short of the S20 Ultra from last year and far behind the 48-hour battery of the iPhone 12 Pro Max. Changing the screen from the default dynamic 120Hz refresh rate and FHD+ resolution to the higher QHD+ resolution reduced the battery life by a couple of hours. Sustainability Samsung does not provide an estimate of the number of full-charge cycles the battery should last. Batteries in similar devices can typically last for 500 cycles while maintaining at least 80% of their original capacity.
The phone is generally repairable and comes with a 24-month warranty. Screen repairs for its predecessor the S20 Ultra cost £269. The battery is replaceable by authorised service centres at a cost of no more than £59. Samsung offers trade-in and recycling schemes for old devices, but the smartphone does not include any recycled materials. The company publishes annual sustainability reports but not impact assessments for individual products. The S21 Ultra does not ship with headphones or a power adaptor in the box, just a USB-C charging cable, reducing its carbon footprint. One UI 3.1
The S21 Ultra is one of the first smartphones to run Samsung’s latest version of Android 11 called One UI 3.1. It inherits most of the new features from Android 11 including: separation of conversation, media and other alerts in the notifications shade; conversation bubbles; and additional privacy controls over location and other permissions. A new partnership between Samsung and Google brings the search firm’s Discover feed and Messages texting app to the S21 series. Various Microsoft apps and systems for linking data and apps into Windows 10 are also present, which work well too. There is a bit of app duplication, including two different SMS apps both called “Messages” – one made by Samsung and the other Google – but overall One UI 3.1 continues to be one of the most refined and best heavily customised versions of Android. Samsung has pledged to support at least major Android version updates and monthly security patches, which is good for Android devices, but pales in comparison with Apple’s five-plus years of support for its phones. Camera
The S21 Ultra is the first Samsung smartphone to feature a new quad-camera with a 12MP ultrawide, 108MP standard wide and not one but two 10MP telephoto cameras – one with 3x and one with 10x optical zoom. It is one of the most adaptable camera systems available, out zooming all but Huawei’s P40 Pro Plus from last year. The main camera shoots very good photos, with improved low light performance and better processing than last year’s S20 Ultra. The ultrawide camera is great in bright light, but can start to look a bit dark and overly sharpened compared with the main camera in lower light levels. Both the 3x and 10x cameras produce really good, crisp images even in the relatively dim light of stormy weather. The 3x camera is ideal for zooming in on people and other objects a few metres away, while the 10x magnification enables you to meaningfully close the distance to subjects significantly further away. The camera system can also smoothly zoom from 1x to 10x magnification using hybrid and optical zoom from a combination of the cameras with impressive results. Above 10x magnification, Samsung’s “Space Zoom” system applies a digital zoom to the 10x telephoto camera. Photos shot up to 30x are very good indeed. Carrying on up to the 100x maximum zoom the images are clearly artificially enlarged, but are still a marked improvement from the 100x zoom on Samsung’s previous top smartphones. A new “zoom lock” system helps stabilise your shaking hands at 30x or above. Tap a small preview window and the phone locks in on that patch of the image often turning a blurry mess into a surprisingly sharp image.
Samsung’s night and portrait modes are also improved. A new macro mode Samsung calls “focus enhancer” uses the ultrawide camera to produce some really sharp and good images too. The single take feature, which captures videos, photos and produces animations all at once is great fun and is now faster and smarter. The 40-megapixel selfie camera is one of the best available too. The cameras also shoot excellent video up to 8K with a range of useful tools such as a “director view”, which shows you the view from three of the rear and the selfie camera at once. Samsung continues to lead Android rivals on video. Observations
Call quality was really good both normally and on speaker. Focus enhancer occasionally triggered when just trying to shoot using the main camera, resulting in overly sharpened images. The three preview thumbnails in directors view are simulated from the ultrawide camera, but the main view switches to the appropriate camera when selected. The S21 Ultra supports Samsung’s S Pen stylus similar to the Note 20 Ultra which can be bought as an optional extra. Price The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra costs £1,149 with 128GB of storage, £1,199 with 256GB or £1,329 with 512GB and 16GB of RAM, shipping on the 28 January. For comparison, the Galaxy S21 costs £769, the Galaxy S21+ costs £819, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra costs £1,179, the Galaxy Z Flip costs £1,300, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 costs £1,799; the OnePlus 8 Pro costs £799 and the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max costs £1,099. Verdict The Galaxy S21 Ultra is Samsung’s latest big, heavy and expensive superphone that makes meaningful improvements to both the camera and general usability. All the usual top-quality elements are there. The screen is stunning, performance is good, battery life is excellent and the software is the latest available. But it is the much improved fingerprint scanner that makes the biggest difference to day-to-day usage – it’s fast, accurate and responsive in a way Samsung’s previous efforts just weren’t. The new dual-telephoto camera system is also a marked improvement, providing a level of flexibility and optical zoom that you just can’t get with other mainstream rivals. Samsung provides at least three years of major software updates, which matches the best of Android rivals but lags behind Apple’s five years of iOS updates. If you want the best Android superphone the Galaxy S21 Ultra is it and will take some beating this year. Pros: big 120Hz screen, 5G, great and flexible camera, 3x and 10x optical zoom, dual sim, One UI, wireless charging and powershare, good performance, long battery, fast fingerprint scanner. Cons: huge, heavy, very expensive, no headphone socket, only three-plus years of software updates.

2021-01-21T15:44:00Z,technology,Technology,Facebook admits encryption will harm efforts to prevent child exploitation,"Facebook’s plans to implement end-to-end encryption on all its messaging products will lead to continued exploitation of some of the British children it would otherwise help to safeguard, the company has admitted to a House of Commons committee. The firm operates a number of programmes to find and prevent child exploitation on its platforms, from scanning private messages to acting on referrals from law enforcement and other social media sites. Between them, according to evidence submitted to the home affairs committee, these programmes report around 3,000 at-risk children to the British National Crime Agency each year. Plans to switch on end-to-end encryption for all private messaging will reduce the number of cases that Facebook is able to uncover, Monika Bickert, the firm’s head of global policy management, told the committee on Wednesday. Asked by the committee’s chair, Yvette Cooper, to estimate the number of cases that would “disappear” under the switch, Bickert replied: “I don’t know the answer to that. I would expect the numbers to go down. If content is being shared and we don’t have access to that content, if it’s content we cannot see then it’s content we cannot report.” Cooper, who cited estimates from the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that 70% of reports from Facebook would be lost, expressed shock at the decision. “Why on earth – why, seriously, why is Facebook trying to introduce something that will put more children at risk, that will make it harder to rescue vulnerable children? Why are you doing this?” Bickert said: “We want to make sure that we are providing an experience that keeps people safe, especially for the crimes that are most at home, and most serious to them. In the UK, adults who were surveyed have said that the crimes online that are most concerning to them are data loss and hacking. “I spent my background as a prosecutor working on cases like violent offences to children and human trafficking offences, but I also want to be mindful of all the different types of abuse that we see online. I don’t think there’s a very clear answer on how to keep people the most safe most of the time. This is something also that governments have struggled for as long as I have studied or been aware of it.” On Tuesday the NSPCC called on Facebook to resume scanning for indications of child abuse in the EU. The social network has stopped one programme intended to protect children owing to fears that a new EU privacy directive rendered it unlawful, but the children’s charity argued that Facebook had drawn the wrong conclusion, and pointed to continued efforts from companies including Google and Microsoft to back up its assertion. Earlier in the committee hearing, Twitter admitted that its platform had played a part in the violence at the US Capitol on 6 January. “My colleagues were shocked watching the events in the Capitol and I think it’s impossible for anyone to look at that and not think ‘did we play a part in this?’” said Twitter’s head of policy, Nick Pickles. “And we have to conclude: yes. “Four years ago we’d have had a different answer. There’s not been an obvious tipping point. Last year we looked at QAnon, for example, and deamplified it; this year, we changed our approach and aggressively removed 70,000 accounts. Knowing what we now know, would we have removed them earlier? Yes.” Twitter’s admission of failings is in stark contrast to Facebook, whose chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, last week denied the site had a major role in the riots. “I think these events were largely organised on platforms that don’t have our abilities to stop hate, don’t have our standards and don’t have our transparency,” Sandberg told a conference organised by Reuters. Her remarks were met with disbelief, as reporters continue to catalogue groups with tens of thousands of members on Facebook who were openly planning events with slogans such as “If they won’t hear us, they will fear us: Occupy Congress”."
2021-01-21T06:01:23Z,technology,Technology,Amazon wins 49% of new TV streaming customers in run-up to Christmas,"Amazon proved more popular than Netflix in the run-up to Christmas as live Premier League and international rugby helped it attract half of all new UK subscribers to streaming services in the final quarter last year. There were almost 1.3m new subscriptions to services such as Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime, which includes access to Prime Video as well as perks such as free delivery on purchases, as bored Britain turned to streaming in record numbers to stay entertained during the pandemic. In the final quarter Amazon attracted 49%, or more than 635,000, of all new subscribers to paid streaming services – which also include Sky’s Now TV, and BritBox from ITV and the BBC – according to the latest research from the data firm Kantar. That total was almost three times the number of new subscribers to its nearest rival, Netflix, which took 17%. Its autumn crowd-pullers included The Crown and The Queen’s Gambit in the Christmas quarter.
Amazon’s strategy of offering live sport – a genre Netflix has ruled out – alongside general entertainment proved a winner as the retail giant looked to increase subscriptions to Amazon Prime in the key festive retail season. Amazon broadcasted 20 live Premier League games, the second of three seasons under its current deal, as well as the Autumn Nations Cup rugby competition involving the home nations and teams from Fiji, France, Italy and Georgia. The global hit TV series The Boys and the Borat film sequel also fuelled a surge in subscribers. “In the fourth quarter 1.3 million British households took out a new video streaming subscription, and Amazon’s Prime Video captured almost half of these,” said Dominic Sunnebo, senior vice-president at Kantar’s Worldpanel operation. “Amazon’s increasing focus on live sports continues to pay big dividends.” The research also revealed the impact of the arrival last March of Disney+, which launched under the best possible conditions as the UK went into lockdown. It attracted more than 50% of total new UK subscribers in the first quarter, powered by Star Wars TV series spinoff The Mandalorian and films such as Frozen 2. However, growth slowed considerably as the pandemic wore on, with the streaming service attracting 15% of new subscribers in the final quarter. Overall, for the full year, Disney+ drew the largest proportion of new UK subscribers, 38% of the total, with Amazon’s Prime Video taking a quarter and Netflix 19%. Kantar’s research also found the fourth quarter proved to be the best of the year by some distance for new subscribers to BritBox, which took a 5.2% share of total new sign-ups, which was attributed to the return of satire Spitting Image. Most popular shows on UK subscription streaming services in the fourth quarter 2020 1 The Crown – Netflix 2 The Queen’s Gambit – Netflix 3 The Mandalorian – Disney+ 4 The Boys – Amazon Prime Video 5 The Undoing – Sky’s Now TV Source: Kantar • This article was corrected on 21 January 2021.

2021-01-21T03:10:44Z,technology,Technology,Facebook asks Australia to let it make content deals with news outlets before being hit with media code,"Facebook has asked the Australian government to consider giving digital platforms a six-month grace period to make deals with news outlets to pay for content before hitting companies with the “big stick” of the news media bargaining code. Ahead of Facebook’s appearance on Friday before a Senate committee examining the federal government’s news media and digital platforms mandatory bargaining code bill, the social media giant told the committee the code remained “complex, unpredictable and unworkable”. Facebook argued instead, companies subject to the code which would require them to negotiate payments with news media companies for their content, should be given time to make deals separately before the code takes effect. The company compared the proposed change with the federal government’s “big stick” energy provider legislation.
“Given our success in reaching commercial agreements in other jurisdictions without the threat of regulation, we are optimistic that Facebook could reach commercial deals with major Australian publishers,” Facebook said in its submission. “One possible way to allow this to happen would be to institute a grace period where digital platforms are given assurances they will not be designated (or subject to the threat of penalties or damages) if they enter into satisfactory commercial agreements with major news organisations within a reasonable period of time (say, six months). “There could also be a requirement to support regional and local news (for example, through a competitive funding pool or grant round). Concepts like a grace period approach have been used in other laws, like the energy sector’s ‘big stick’ legislation.” Under the code, if news companies and digital platforms like Facebook cannot make agreements on the amount to be paid, ultimately an arbiter will make the final decision. Facebook said this would “incentivise” news companies to make unreasonable claims, and meant the final figure would be “detached from commercial value”. The company also argued it would not be able to manage the amount it would have to pay because it could not determine how much content is posted on Facebook. “Facebook is effectively compelled to acquire all news content at whatever price is determined,” Facebook said. “Unlike every other regulated access regime, Facebook does not retain any discretion as to volume, for example, we cannot decide to manage liability by acquiring less content or no content from a publisher.” The company also warned it believed it would potentially need to make up to 1,000 different agreements with media companies if those media companies sought to strike different agreements depending on the masthead – for example if Nine decided to negotiate separately for Nine News, Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the Australian Financial Review.
Australian tech company Atlassian has also weighed in on the proposed code, telling the committee in its submission that the code would “disrupt neutrality” on the internet by creating one special class that receives payment for links in search results. “No other types of websites on the internet are paid in this way, for merely appearing in search results or on social media platforms. Legislation creating ‘government-favoured’ categories of websites will only disrupt neutrality on the internet, opening the door for other content to claim favoured status,” Atlassian said. “Although the boundaries of the code … are narrowly drawn, the way in which [news media] as a category are ‘favoured’ through its application could open the door to other content owners seeking similar or equivalent favourable treatment outside of its terms.” Atlassian said a 14-day notification period for alerting news companies to changes in the algorithm used in search results or news feeds would also be impractical because changes in code and algorithm happen on a daily basis. The public broadcasters, ABC and SBS – which were initially excluded from the code before the government opted to include them – both raised concerns that the final legislation removes the obligation on companies like Facebook to empower news companies to better moderate user comments. Both publishers noted that, without premoderation for comments, they have had to decide between having significant resources devoted to moderating comments as they appear, or not posting articles on contentious issues on Facebook. Facebook will appear second before the committee on Friday, just after Google and before Nine, Newscorp, AAP and Guardian Australia. ABC and SBS are scheduled for the afternoon, along with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission."
2021-01-20T15:57:25Z,technology,Technology,Facebook under pressure to resume scanning messages for child abuse in EU,"The children’s charity NSPCC has called on Facebook to resume a programme that scanned private messages for indications of child abuse, with new data suggesting that almost half of referrals for child sexual abuse material are now falling below the radar. Recent changes to the European commission’s e-privacy directive, which are being finalised, require messaging services to follow strict new restrictions on the privacy of message data. Facebook blamed that directive for shutting down the child protection operation, but the children’s charity says Facebook has gone too far in reading the law as banning it entirely. “It’s striking that Facebook has interpreted the failure to reach agreement before Christmas as requiring them to stop scanning, when what that seems to be is a breaking of ranks from the rest of the industry,” says Andy Burrows, the charity’s head of child safety online policy. The rest of the industry, including Google and Microsoft, has come to a different conclusion about the continued legality of such scanning, Burrows added. “What’s important here is that we don’t lose sight of what this means,” he said, adding that 250,000 reports come from the EU each month. “There has to be a clear risk from Facebook right now that abusers are seeing this as an opportunity to target children using Facebook services, because this is a period when most of the monitoring services are turned off,” he said. The US National Center for Missing & Exploited Children has released data showing a 46% fall in referrals for child sexual abuse material coming from the EU in the first three weeks since Facebook turned off scanning. In the UK, which is no longer covered by the directive, Facebook continues to operate its scanning programme, as it does in the rest of the world. Polling shows that 18% of UK adults trust Facebook to make the right decisions when it comes to protecting children from child abuse online, against 55% who disagree with the statement. The NSPCC’s fear is that the social network is using the new regulations as a pretext to stop scanning for child abuse imagery, since it is openly planning technological changes which would make such scanning impossible. In 2019, Mark Zuckerberg announced a “pivot to privacy” for Facebook, with a plan to integrate the company’s messaging services (Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp) and encrypt the contents. “When the rest of the industry has arrived at the conclusion that scanning is permissible, and recognised that the immediate impacts of stopping it are considerable, it feels highly improbable that Facebook’s alternative reading isn’t directly related to where they want to go with end-to-end encryption,” Burrows said. In a joint statement, four of Facebook’s competitors, including Google, Microsoft and Roblox, said last year that they would continue to scan their platforms. “We believe the only responsible approach is to remain steadfast in honouring our safety commitments that European users – and, indeed, users around the world – expect and rely upon,” the four said. But Facebook denied it had a choice, and disputed the allegation that it was seeking other reasons to stop scanning. “We’re committed to complying with the European commission’s e-privacy directive (ePD) in the EU,” a spokesperson said. “We continue to be concerned with parts of the ePD and the proposed amendment. We have suggested changes that would permit us to use metadata to help keep people safe while retaining important privacy protections. “Our compliance with the e-privacy directive does not mean we are stopping our fight against child sexual abuse and we still have a number of tools in place to help keep people safe. We’ve invested heavily in technology and people to prevent, detect and respond to potential harm and abuse, and will continue to invest in these tools as allowed under the law.” The EU is finalising the new rules through its trialogue process, in which the European commission, council and parliament negotiate a final version of the text. When that is concluded, which could be as soon as next week, there may be more explicit permission for Facebook to resume its scanning."
2021-01-20T07:00:13Z,technology,Technology,Far-right extremists take over UK land sales Facebook page,"On 14 January, the 40,000 Britons who had joined the Facebook group Land for Sale UK awoke to find their newsfeed transformed. Until then, the group had been a moderately sized message board for people looking to buy or sell small parcels of land. “We’d love a patch of land in the Falmouth and Penryn area to let the kids roam, grow fruit trees,” read one typical post. But on Thursday morning, Land for Sale UK ceased to exist. Its new administrators had changed its branding and name to better reflect the group they wanted to run: it is now called “Supporters of free speech against Big Tech Fascism.” The main image, once a bucolic pastoral landscape, is now a poorly cropped photo of a statue of Cicero with a quote falsely attributed to the Roman orator by gun rights advocates in which he defends “any and every method of protecting ourselves”. And the group’s “about” page has been changed to explain the new position of the group: “Banning people for for [sic] telling the truth or you don’t like their opinion or politics is wrong. If your a Libtard you dont belong here. Good bye.”
The bizarre saga underscores the extent to which Facebook groups, once central to the social network’s desire to devolve the hard work of content moderation to its user base, are increasingly becoming a major source of problems for the company. The administrator of a large Facebook group holds one of the most influential positions on modern social media, but comes with few checks or balances, allowing just a single person to radically change the focus of thousands or millions of people’s Facebook feeds.
For the group formerly known as Land for Sale UK, that means the 40,000 members suddenly began seeing content accusing Joe Biden of stealing the US election, anti-fascist campaigners of dressing up as Trump supporters to stage a false-flag attack on Congress, and Twitter of trying to censor the views of hardworking Americans. Normally, posts on Land for Sale UK received little engagement. The small group had no advertising budget behind it, leaving posts appearing on users’ newsfeeds through “organic” sharing only, and requests to buy or sell agricultural land are not conventional viral material. But the takeover, ironically, was perfect for boosting user interactions: every confused comment was taken as a sign by Facebook’s algorithms that the content was particularly engaging, which led to it being pushed into more feeds, and receiving more comments. None of the three new administrators of the group, all of whom appear to live in Southampton, replied to requests for comment from the Guardian. Shortly after they were asked about their decision to rebrand the page, it was switched to a “private” group, and users who tried to co-ordinate a transfer to a new Land for Sale group were banned from posting. “I was surprised when a post popped up on my timeline from a group I never joined,” said Saffy, one of those users. “The content seemed to be from rightwing extremists sharing lots of links and articles to political agendas and conspiracies in support of Trump. I would never willingly join a group that supports this type of propaganda, but when I reported to Facebook I was told it did not go against their community standards. “By allowing groups like this to continue, Facebook is complicit in perpetuating the message of these extreme far right groups.” A spokesperson for Facebook said: “Our Community Standards apply in both public and private Groups, and we have removed violating content from this Group. We place restrictions on the number of times you can change a Group’s name, and we will review any misleading changes. Everyone on Facebook can see the history of what a Group was called and members also receive a notification if the name changes so they can decide if it is still for them.” Land for Sale is by no means the largest Facebook group to be taken over in such a fashion, though its rebranding is more extreme than most. Earlier this month, Substack email newsletter author Ryan Broderick reported on Giggle Palooza, a meme page with 1.6 million followers, which transformed almost overnight from a page that posted mild Christian gags (“being a christian isn’t easy, but the retirement plan is amazing”) to “posting QAnon content and warning its followers that a military dictatorship is imminent”. In 2017, just a month after the inauguration of Donald Trump, Mark Zuckerberg posted a 6,000-word manifesto on the future of Facebook in which he described a desire to focus on “meaningful” groups as an attempt to counter the “striking decline in the important social infrastructure of local communities”."
2021-01-20T02:14:46Z,technology,Technology,One Nation MPs lost more followers than other Australian politicians in Twitter purge of QAnon accounts,"One Nation politicians including Pauline Hanson have suffered the biggest drop in followers of all Australian politicians as Twitter purged accounts associated with the QAnon conspiracy theory. Following the insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January, Twitter announced it had suspended 70,000 accounts promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory, after many of those involved in rioting at the Capitol espoused the fraudulent theory as their motivation. “These accounts were engaged in sharing harmful QAnon-associated content at scale and were primarily dedicated to the propagation of this conspiracy theory across the service,” Twitter said.
“Our updated enforcement on QAnon content on Twitter, along with routine spam challenges, has resulted in changes in follower count for some people’s Twitter accounts. In some cases, these actions may have resulted in follower count changes in the thousands.” The action reportedly caused follower counts among Republican politicians to drop, and appears to have had a similar impact on the follower count of a number of rightwing Australian politicians, according to social tracking site Social Blade. Most notably, One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has lost close to 4% of her Twitter followers in the past 30 days, down 2,567 followers in the past 30 days from 65,563 to 62,970. The biggest loss of more than 1,000 followers occurred on 9 January, but there have been several days in January where the minority party leader has lost several hundred followers a day. Fellow One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts has lost 1,410 followers, down to 21,191, while the NSW One Nation leader Mark Latham lost 1,572 followers, down to 48,055. There is no suggestion the politicians themselves support or promote the QAnon conspiracy theory, however, University of Tasmania academic Kaz Ross noted last year the conspiracy theory had proved popular in Australia in part because of other similar conspiracy theories such as Agenda 21. “The belief that ‘Agenda 21’ is a blueprint for corrupt global governance has become a core tenet of QAnon in Australia,” Ross said. Hanson’s “It’s OK to be white” motion in the Senate mimics a slogan that has its origins in the same far-right sites that spawned QAnon, 4chan and 8chan. The losses among MPs from other conservative parties are much lower. Katter Australia party MP Bob Katter has lost 225 followers. Liberal National party senator Gerard Rennick lost 133 of his followers, taking his count down to 1,106, while Liberal MP Tim Wilson has lost 178, down to 20,099. One of the more active Liberal MPs on Twitter, Dave Sharma, has increased his follower count by 302 in the past 30 days, losing just 21 followers around the time of the purge, to take his follower count to 8,719. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, lost 757 followers over the course of two days this month, but has made up for the losses to increase his follower count by 8,383 to 514,868. Labor leader Anthony Albanese did not record any loss in followers across any of the days, increasing his follower count to 254,215, up 3,504. The Greens leader Adam Bandt lost 18 followers on 10 January, but overall his total is up 453 over the past few weeks to 197,924.
The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, added 554 followers, up to 19,025, despite losing 41 followers on 9 and 10 January. Labor shadow minister Brendan O’Connor lost 1,039 followers on 7 January, but has regained more since, closing out 163 followers ahead at 19,760. Liberal MP Craig Kelly, who has been criticised by Labor for his Facebook posts about the US Capitol attacks and Covid-19, has not tweeted since April 2020, but lost 147 followers over 9 to 11 January. Since then, however, he has made up ground, adding 172 followers in total to 8,760. Hanson remains one of the most popular politicians on Facebook. On Tuesday she had the top two posts on Facebook among all Australian federal politicians."
2021-01-19T07:00:50Z,technology,Technology,Galaxy Buds Pro review: Samsung's AirPods Pro-beating earbuds,"Samsung’s latest Galaxy Buds Pro earbuds add noise-cancelling, virtual surround and improved sound, making them a challenger to Apple’s AirPods Pro. At £219, they are the new top-of-the-range earbuds from Samsung, sitting above the £179 Galaxy Buds Live and £159 Galaxy Buds+. The Buds Pro have silicone ear tips and a general shape similar to the Buds+ but look more like the Buds Live. They are stored in an excellent, compact, square charging case that easily fits into the money pocket of a pair of jeans.
The new earbuds are bigger and heavier than the Buds+ and do not twist to fit in the concha of your ear in quite the same way, protruding slightly further, but are still small compared with rivals. They do a good job of avoiding putting pressure on the delicate parts of the ear, held in place by the oval ear tips – of which there are three sizes in the box. They were comfortable and stayed securely in my ears but you can twist a small lip of the earbud under the cartilage of your ear to lock them in place if needed. The earbuds are water resistant to IPX7 standards, which means they can be submerged in up to one metre of water for up to 30 minutes, making them some of the most water-resistant earbuds available. Specifications Water resistance: IPX7 (one metre up to 30 minutes) Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.0, SBC, AAC, SSC Battery life: five hours ANC on (up to 18 hours with case; 28 hours with ANC off) Earbud dimensions: 19.5 x 20.5 x 20.8 mm Earbud weight: 6.3g each Driver size: 11mm woofer + 6.5mm tweeter Charging case dimensions: 50 x 50.2 x 27.8 mm Charging case weight: 44.9g Case charging: USB-C, Qi wireless charging Connectivity and controls
The Buds Pro support Bluetooth 5 with both the universal SBC and AAC audio standards used by most devices. But they also support Samsung’s own “scalable audio codec”, which can provide higher-quality audio but only works with Samsung devices. They are compatible with all standard Bluetooth devices and support automatic pairing with Samsung and other Android devices via the Galaxy Wearable app plus Swift Pairing with Windows 10 PCs. Unlike their predecessors, the Buds Pro are not supported by the Galaxy Buds app on an iPhone, so iOS users can use the earbuds but will not be able to change settings or update them. The earbuds only connect to one device at a time but support seamless switching (so you don’t have to manually disconnect) and a new auto-switch system that can be used with Samsung devices running OneUI 3.1 or higher such as the new Galaxy S21 series. Either earbud can be used on its own. Connectivity to a Galaxy Z Fold 2, iPhone 12, MacBook Air M1 and other devices was excellent. The exterior of the earbud is touch sensitive. Tap once for pause/play, twice and thrice for track skip. A tap-and-hold gesture can be set to control the volume (left for down, right for up), control noise-cancelling settings, activate the voice assistant or trigger Spotify on compatible phones. Take both earbuds out and the music pauses; take only one out and ambient sound mode activates on the other. The controls work well with good audible feedback. Battery life
The earbuds last for up to five hours with noise-cancelling active and can be charged 2.6 times in the case for a total of 18 hours. Turn off noise-cancelling and the earbuds last up to eight hours and up to 28 hours with the case. Five minutes charging will add up to one hour of playback. The case is charged via a Qi wireless charging coil in its base or the USB-C socket in the back. A cable is included in the box but not a power adaptor. Sustainability Samsung does not provide an estimate of the number of full-charge cycles the batteries in the case or earbuds should last. Batteries in similar devices can typically last for 500 cycles while maintaining at least 80% of their original capacity. Samsung does not sell individual replacement buds or cases. The Buds Pro are repairable but unlike previous Samsung earbuds the battery cannot be replaced, ultimately making them disposable.
The earbuds and case are made from 20% post-consumer recycled materials including plastic. Samsung operates recycling and trade-in schemes for smartphones but not for its earbuds. The company publishes annual sustainability reports but not impact assessments for individual products. Excellent sound
The Buds Pro take the easy-listening, everyday sound of the Buds+ and improve the audio quality in all dimensions. They produce rich and well-controlled bass, warm mids and precise high notes that make them some of the best-sounding true wireless earbuds available. They handle many music genres well, with a wider soundscape than most earbuds. Acoustic, guitar-based tracks such as the live version of the Eagles’ Hotel California sound warm, inviting and full of detail. There’s plenty of punch and raw energy in grunge or rock tracks, while high-tempo electronica sounds suitably energised. The earbuds do an admiral job of rendering really deep bass, while even orchestral scores such as Holst’s Planet suite sound grand and full of nuance. Occasionally, you can get hit with a little too much treble, such as overly prominent trumpets at higher volumes, but overall they sound really great, matching top rivals such as the Jabra Elite 85t. There’s a limited equaliser that can switch between preset modes such as “dynamic” or “bass boost” in the companion app. Active noise cancelling
The Buds Pro have several active noise-cancelling and ambient sound modes. There are two levels of noise-cancelling available. On high, the noise-cancelling is effective at reducing low rumbles and some mid-frequency sounds but falls slightly short of the effectiveness of the Elite 85t and AirPods Pro. The Buds Pro were also affected to a greater extent by the fit of the earbuds – twisting and locking them in place against the inside of my ear significantly improved the amount of noise they blocked out. The ambient sound mode, which pipes the noise of the outside world into your ears, has four levels and can be automatically triggered when the earbuds detect you speaking. It works pretty well for quick conversations or hearing announcements but doesn’t sound as natural as the best available. The earbuds also have Dolby technology that tracks the movements of your head in relation to a phone or tablet to create a virtual surround sound Samsung calls 360 Audio. It only works with devices running Samsung’s latest software OneUI 3.1 but, unlike rival systems from Apple and others, it is able to create the virtual surround effect for any video, not only those with Dolby soundtracks, anchoring the sound to the screen. The effect is surprisingly good. Observations
You can set Samsung’s Bixby voice assistant to listen for the wakeword “Hey Bixby”. Game Mode reduces latency for audio that is in sync with the action on screen for games with Samsung devices. Call quality was reasonable: my voice was clear and background noise was minimised but I sounded a little distant and not as crisp as the best rivals. Sneezing, blowing my nose and coughing triggered the auto-ambient sound mode when active. Price The Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro cost £219 and are available in black, silver or purple, shipping on 28 January. For comparison, the Galaxy Buds Live have an RRP of £179, the Galaxy Buds+ cost £129, the Jabra Elite 85t cost £219.99, the Bose QC Earbuds cost £249.95, the Sony WF-1000XM3 cost £149 and the Apple AirPods Pro cost £249. Verdict The Galaxy Buds Pro are Samsung’s best true wireless earbuds yet. They pack excellent sound with solid noise-cancelling into small and comfortable earbuds without stalks, which have good battery life and a great, compact case – a combination that’s still hard to find. They are also water-resistant to a high standard, which can’t be said for most competitors, and are made with recycled materials. They are not cheap, costing £219, which puts them in the top end of the market, beating Apple’s AirPods Pro on sound but falling short of the Jabra Elite 85t on noise-cancelling. If other Samsung earbuds are any indication, you should be able to find them with a reasonable discount if you shop around in the near future. Unlike previous Samsung earbuds, the batteries in the Buds Pro cannot be replaced, which is a disappointing step back and ultimately makes them disposable, similar to most other true wireless earbuds, losing them a star. Samsung does not recycle the earbuds either. They can be used with an iPhone but are not supported by the Galaxy Buds app, so you can’t change the settings or keep them up to date. The Galaxy Buds Pro are Samsung’s true AirPods Pro-beaters for Android – an excellent set of premium everyday true wireless earbuds. Pros: great sound, solid noise-cancelling, seamless switching, good controls, comfortable fit, excellent case, solid battery, no stalks, IPX7 water resistance, made of recycled materials. Cons: expensive, battery cannot be replaced, some features restricted to Samsung devices, can only connect to one device at a time.

2021-01-19T03:19:49Z,technology,Technology,Facebook claims it does not conduct business in Australia in Cambridge Analytica appeal,"Facebook is claiming it does not conduct business in Australia and does not collect and hold data in the country in its effort to avoid liability over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Last year, the privacy commissioner took Facebook to court over an alleged mass privacy breach involving the use of Australians’ Facebook data in a vote-influencing operation involving Cambridge Analytica, a company that assisted the Trump campaign and was then headed by Trump’s key adviser Steve Bannon. The court action came two years after revelations in the Guardian and Observer that 50m Facebook users worldwide had their names, dates of birth, emails, city locations, friends lists, page likes and – in some cases – messages harvested to build powerful software that could predict and shape voter choices.
The information was gathered through a personality quiz app named “This is your digital life”, which collected the data of those who downloaded the app and their unwitting friends. Only 53 people in Australia installed the app, according to court documents, but it was able to harvest the data of 311,127 Australians in total. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner has accused Facebook of serious and repeated breaches of privacy law by leaving its users exposed to having their data sold and “used for purposes including political profiling, well outside users’ expectations”. The case was brought against Facebook Inc, based in Delaware, and Facebook Ireland, meaning that the OAIC had to convince a court it had a prima facie case that both offshore companies carried out business in Australia and may have contravened Australia’s privacy laws. Facebook’s parent company, Facebook Inc, has repeatedly fought the suggestion it does business in Australia, and lost. As part of its case, it argued that it does not collect or hold data on Australian users in Australia. That argument was rejected by Justice Thomas Thawley in September, who found Facebook Inc did collect and store information in Australia, through caching servers located here and through the installation and operation of cookies on Australian devices. Thawley also found the company conducted business in Australia by providing local app developers with what is known as the Graph Application Programming Interface – a piece of software allowing apps to request personal information from Facebook users. Now, Facebook is seeking to appeal Thawley’s ruling to the full bench of the federal court. Court documents show it is arguing that “substantial injustice” would be caused if it is not given leave to appeal to the court. Facebook says the appeal examines “important questions” about how privacy laws define what it means to carry on business in Australia and “collect” or “hold” personal information.
The OAIC did not comment on Facebook’s latest appeal. But in September, following its success in the federal court, the regulator said: “While these matters remain to be established at trial, the court held the matters were sufficiently arguable to justify service outside of Australia and subjecting Facebook Inc to proceedings in Australia.” Facebook was approached for comment."
2021-01-18T17:02:56Z,technology,Technology,"Twitter suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene, QAnon-backing Republican","Twitter has temporarily suspended the account of the Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has gained a large following on social media, in part by posting incendiary videos and comments. Greene, a Republican businesswoman, is the first candidate who expressed support for the baseless, far-right QAnon conspiracy theory to win a US House seat. Greene in November won the race for Georgia’s 14th congressional district after her Democratic opponent had dropped out.
On Sunday, she posted a clip from an interview with a local news outlet in which she condemned Georgia election officials and expressed support for debunked theories claiming that voting machines, absentee ballots and other issues led to widespread fraud in the state during the presidential election. Twitter responded to the tweet, and others, with a message that called the election fraud claim “disputed”, and saying it posed “a risk of violence”. A statement from Greene’s team on Sunday included screenshots from Twitter that appeared to show the company informing the congresswoman she had violated its rules and would be prohibited from interacting with content on the site for 12 hours. Greene said in a statement her account had been suspended “without explanation”. Greene has faced national scrutiny for racist and bigoted statements and posts supporting QAnon, the baseless conspiracy theory rooted in antisemitic tropes whose followers believe Donald Trump is secretly fighting against a cabal of Democrats, billionaires and celebrities engaged in child trafficking. The FBI has identified the movement as a potential domestic terrorism threat, and it has repeatedly inspired vigilante violence. Last week, Greene wore a face mask that said “censored” on it during her remarks on on Trump’s second impeachment. Greene was speaking on the House floor, during a session broadcast on national television. Twitter last week banned Trump from its platform, citing “the risk of further incitement of violence” following the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January. As of 12 January, the company had also suspended more than 70,000 accounts associated with QAnon as it attempted to rein in harmful activity ahead of the presidential inauguration. Twitter has said it is taking action against online behaviour “that has the potential to lead to offline harm” after the mob of Trump supporters tried to violently storm the Capitol building. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Greene’s suspension."
2021-01-17T10:15:02Z,technology,Technology,How Trump supporters are radicalised by the far right,"Far right “playbooks” teaching white nationalists how to recruit and radicalise Trump supporters have surfaced on the encrypted messaging app Telegram ahead of Joe Biden’s inauguration. The documents, seen by the Observer, detail how to convert mainstream conservatives who have just joined Telegram into violent white supremacists. They were found last week by Tech Against Terrorism, an initiative launched by the UN counter terrorism executive directorate. Large numbers of Trump supporters migrated on to Telegram in recent days after Parler, the social media platform favoured by the far right, was forced offline for hosting threats of violence and racist slurs after the attack on the US Capitol on 6 January. The documents have prompted concern that far right extremists congregating on Telegram instead of Parler has made it far harder for law enforcement to track where the next attack could come from. Already, hundreds of suspects threatening violence during this week’s inauguration of Biden have been identified by the FBI. One of the playbooks, found on a channel with 6,000 subscribers, was specially drawn up to radicalise Trump supporters who had just joined Telegram and teach them “how to have the proper OPSEC [operations security] to keep your identity concealed”. The four-page document encourages recruiters to avoid being overtly racist or antisemitic initially when approaching Trump supporters, stating: “Trying to show them racial IQ stats and facts on Jewish power will generally leave them unreceptive... that material will be instrumental later on in their ideological journey. “The point of discussion you should focus on is the blatant anti-white agenda that is being aggressively pushed from every institution in the country, as well as white demographic decline and its consequences.” The document concludes with its author stating: “Big Tech made a serious mistake by banishing conservatives to the one place [Telegram] where we have unfettered access to them, and that’s a mistake they’ll come to regret!” The document is named the “comprehensive redpill guide”, a reference to the online term red-pilling, used to describe a conversion to extreme far-right views. The document adds: “Not every normie can be redpilled, but if they’re receptive and open-minded to hearing what you have to say, you should gradually be sending them edgier pro-white/anti-Zionist content as they move along in their journey.” Another white nationalist recruitment guide uncovered by Tech Against Terrorism, which is working with global tech firms to tackle terrorist use of the internet, shares seven steps of “conservative conversion”.
Found on a Telegram channel with 1,732 subscribers, it also advocates white supremacist recruiters hiding their true credentials because most mainstream Trump supporters would be initially wary of strangers espousing extremist views. “To them ‘Nazism’ is the worst thing possible. So having a swastika as a pfp [picture for profile] or your name being “heilhitler88” will automatically turn them off,” states the guide. It adds: “Ask them questions such as: ‘What are conservatives conserving? Why are we losing? Is it a coincidence that Hollywood, corporations and media are all against us? Who is responsible?’ (Don’t go into Jews controlling everything, they worship Ben Shapiro [US conservative commentator], they need to come across that idea themselves).” Adam Hadley, founder and director of Tech Against Terrorism, said Parler’s downfall and the resultant exodus of disenfranchised Trump supporters on to Telegram could escalate the numbers of individuals who could be classified as a threat. “There is much to be concerned about in the far-right playbooks we have uncovered on Telegram. “If mainstream social media platforms are too quick to ban users who post material that may be distasteful, but not illegal, we simply push them into the hands of those who seek to radicalise them.” Hadley added: “At this pivotal moment in the fight against violent extremism, we must ensure our response upholds the very democratic principles we seek to protect, and that we cannot be accused of stifling legitimate political debate.”"
2021-01-15T20:22:09Z,technology,Technology,Far-right website 8kun again loses internet service protection following Capitol attack,"
A far-right website that was among the platforms used to organize the deadly violence at the US Capitol has again been forced to find new internet service protection after a shell company owned by two Russians and registered in Scotland cut ties with the platform’s internet host. The website 8kun, previously known as 8chan, has long been one of the preferred platforms of the far right and followers of the baseless conspiracy theory QAnon. It was used by rioters ahead of the 6 January attack to mobilize other “patriots” to “help storm the Capitol”, with some on the message board debating which politicians to kill once they got inside. In the aftermath of the riot, users continued to post content fomenting violence, including maps of government buildings to target and combat techniques for a proposed civil war.
It wasn’t the first time the platform had been linked to acts of violence. Its predecessor site, 8chan, was linked to a series of white nationalist terrorist attacks, including the massacres in Christchurch, New Zealand, and El Paso, Texas. 8kun has faced significant hurdles to remain online since at least 2019, when the El Paso attack occurred. All websites are kept online by a network of services including web hosts and domain name registrars. 8kun has had a loyal internet provider in the Washington state-based VanwaTech, whose CEO has repeatedly defended its connections to the hate site in the name of freedom of speech.
But the site cannot function without platform protection services that prevent DDoS attacks, or distributed denial of service attacks, and few providers have been willing to work with it. Following its removal from the infrastructure company Cloudflare, 8kun, throughVanwaTech, worked with the Oregon-based CNServers LLC for DDoS protection. That company, too, cut ties with 8kun when it was alerted to the site’s violent history. Since October 2020, 8kun had received DDoS protection from DDoS-Guard, a company that provides protection to a number of controversial websites, including the neo-Nazi site the Daily Stormer. 8kun’s ties to DDoS-Guard were first reported by the security researcher and journalist Brian Krebs. This week, DDoS-Guard became the latest company to cut ties with 8kun’s hosting company, VanwaTech, following inquiries from the Guardian. VanwaTech also receives internet connectivity services from the US-based firm FiberHub, which is based in Las Vegas, Nevada, according to analysis from the independent web researcher Ron Guilmette viewed by the Guardian. FiberHub does not provide infrastructure directly to 8kun but does support VanwaTech as a client, FiberHub’s co-founder and chief technology officer Rob Tyree confirmed to the Guardian by email. He issued the following statement on behalf of FiberHub: “We can confirm that VanwaTech is a client of Fiberhub. We do not, however, directly provide infrastructure or services in support of the 8chan/8kun website. “We have received no reports that content hosted by VanwaTech supported by our infrastructure is in violation of our terms of service or acceptable use policy, which includes a requirement to abide by all US federal and state laws and regulations,” Tyree said. “Should we receive any such reports, we would follow our internal policies and observe any legal requirements to resolve those matters as swiftly as possible.” DDoS-Guard, the company that provided services to VanwaTech until earlier this week, was registered under a limited partnership, a financial structure in Scotland that allows non-residents to create companies with little scrutiny, on 24 November 2017 by Aleksei Likhachev and Evgeniy Marchenko – two Russian businessmen who remain owners of the company. The partnership under which DDoS-Guard is registered is called Cognitive Cloud and is listed at an address in Edinburgh’s Forth Street. Speaking from the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don earlier this week, Marchenko told the Guardian that 8kun was not a direct client of DDoS-Guard, but that his company provided services to VanwaTech. He described DDoS-Guard as a global information security service. It hosted “thousands of websites”, he said, adding that it merely provided VanwaTech with “transit protection services” to stop it from falling victim to DDoS or other “brute force” attacks. “It looks like they host some dubious sites like Qanon/8chan/8kun. I still don’t understand what are they about and have no information about their content or activity,” he added.
“We are not related to any politic issues and don’t want to be associated in any sense with customer hosting such toxic sites like QAnon/8chan,” Machenko said after the company severed ties with VanwaTech. Asked why he used a company based in Scotland, Marchenko said: “Why not? The UK is very comfortable for business. I visited London one time, 14 years ago.” He said: “We don’t support any illegal activity. We know nothing about what happened in Washington or support one side or another. This company [VanwaTech] is just one of our many customers.” DDoS-Guard’s other clients include the Russian ministry of defense, as well as media organizations in Moscow. The firm’s webpage links to an official ministry history, which sets out recent steps the Kremlin has taken to ban the use of smartphones by Russian soldiers, after a series of leaks. “It’s OK to earn money from the Russian government or from any other government. It’s just business,” Marchenko said. DDoS-Guard’s Edinburgh office is at 18 Forth Street, a terrace of small Georgian townhouses in the eastern part of Edinburgh’s New Town. There was no evidence of any office belonging to Cognitive Cloud at that address or any of the five other neighbouring townhouses. An employee at a neighbouring business said in his seven years working there, he had never met anyone from Cognitive Cloud but had frequently fielded requests to take mail and parcels for the firm. A manager at the Edinburgh site said Cognitive Cloud was not a tenant at the address but referred the Guardian to another company of a different name based in London, to which she said mail addressed to Cognitive Cloud was meant to be forwarded. The Scottish number listed on the site for DDoS-Guard is disconnected. A tech support representative contacted through the Russian phone number on the site said the majority of its clients were based in Russia and declined to answer any other questions. Marchenko said its Edinburgh office was an “EU subdivision” staffed by a “representative”. VanwaTech did not respond to a request for comment. • This article was amended on 15 January 2021 to clarify that 8kun is not hosted by FiberHub. It was further amended on 19 January 2021 to clarify the nature of FiberHub’s services and include a statement from the company denying any direct involvement with 8kun.net."
2021-01-15T19:00:11Z,technology,Technology,Should you keep using WhatsApp? Plus five tips to start the year with your digital privacy intact,"If you use the popular messaging service WhatsApp you may have noticed a pop-up message in recent days asking you to accept the service’s new terms and conditions by 8 February in order to continue using it. The update has prompted calls for users to leave the popular messaging service in favour of alternatives such as Signal and Telegram. And on Friday a legal challenge on privacy grounds was filed against WhatsApp in India, the service’s biggest market. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has reported an influx of 25 million global users to the rival service since the announcement was made.
But what do the new terms and conditions mean for you? We asked former most-wanted hacker turned security consultant Kevin Mitnick which messaging app he prefers – and to share his tips to set yourself up for a cyber-safe 2021. “I prefer Signal because I know the developer behind the original project, and I know that Signal has been tested in the security community,” Mitnick says. “I believe Telegram has too, and I use Telegram, but not for secure messages.” You can read WhatsApp’s Q&A about the changes here, but the main thing to know is that messages remain end-to-end encrypted and WhatsApp maintains that neither it, nor anyone else, has access to the content of messages between friends, family and groups. WhatsApp also says it doesn’t keep records of your call logs, share your contacts with Facebook and can’t see your shared location.
What has changed is privacy around the content of communication between individuals and businesses that use Facebook hosting services, which will now be accessible to those businesses for their own marketing purposes. As the Guardian’s UK technology editor, Alex Hern, points out the changes aren’t huge, but they do mark a step down the road of a long-term plan to integrate the chat app with Facebook. At the end of the day choosing a messaging app is a personal preference and Mitnick says as long as the service uses end-to-end encryption and its policies protect your privacy you should be OK. Nevertheless, Mitnick says he has “never communicated a secure message over WhatsApp”. While choosing a messaging service is an important choice, there are other ways you can ensure your digital security. Here are Mitnick’s top five tips for protecting your privacy online. 1. Use a password manager Mitnick says the future of security is password-free, with solutions such as Trusona doing away with usernames and passwords in favour of QR codes and two-factor authentication. But until that technology is widespread, a password manager is the number one tool Mitnick recommends. Make your master password a full sentence with all the spaces and correct capitalisation, such as “I went to Byron Bay today”. The password manager will do the heavy lifting from there. Every time you visit a site, it will either autofill your existing password or, if it’s a new site, create a strong password for you. Password managers can also scan your current passwords for weaknesses and recommend stronger versions that conform with randomness. When choosing a password manager, go for Australian, UK or US companies and avoid those based out of Russia or China, Mitnick says. It’s also better to choose a product that has lots of users, like LastPass and One Password, because it’s more likely any vulnerabilities will be picked up quickly. 2. Implement two-factor authentication Two-factor authentication or multi-factor authentication is a sign-in method that requires two or more pieces of evidence of your identity to enable login. The first piece is usually a username and password and the second might be an SMS or an app, such as Google authenticator or Authy. You might find SMS more convenient, but an authenticator app is much more secure. If you need even more security, you can use a YUBikey – a USB authentication device you plug into your computer. A YUBikey is highly secure, but you do have to carry it around with you. 3. Use a VPN Mitnick says whenever you’re not on your home or work network you should be using a VPN – a virtual private network – which keeps your browsing safe from spying.
You can find a service online that will cost you around $60 a year, but, again, you want to make sure you’re using a service that has a good reputation, such as HMA or ExpressVPN. There’s always a risk with VPNs and using an untrustworthy service goes against the purpose, since it will have access to all your browsing data. Things to consider when choosing a service include how many people use it (more is better), and where the company and its servers are located (aim for Five Eyes countries: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US). 4. Do security awareness training Mitnick says everyone should undertake good security awareness training, which will help you understand how you, as a consumer, could be compromised. There are security courses available for free online that walk you through different areas of consumer-based security, including passwords, online banking, avoiding malware, keeping your personal information confidential, protecting your kids online, and securing your home network, email and attachments. 5. Keep your financial transactions separate Not everyone will be able to implement this last tip and Mitnick acknowledges it’s a pain, however it’s a good idea to use a separate device for financial transactions. When you’re surfing the internet, opening files people send you, playing games, the computer you’re using has a high risk of being compromised without you realising it – even if you’re using antivirus software. Mitnick suggests buying an iPad or cheap tablet to use exclusively for financial transactions. He also suggests creating a separate account in your password manager with a distinct master password to store your financial passwords."
2021-01-15T15:34:12Z,technology,Technology,"Wikipedia at 20: last gasp of an internet vision, or a beacon to a better future?","Twenty years ago today, a tech startup called Nupedia launched a side project. The company had been hard at work producing a free online encyclopaedia, but it was slow going: its strict editing process, comprehensive peer review and focus on expert authors meant it finished only 21 articles in its first year. The side project would do away with all of that. Instead, anyone would be able to write and edit articles. Nupedia’s founders were split over whether the trade-off – more content with a lower barrier to entry – was worth it, but by the end of its first year, the side project had amassed articles on more than 18,000 topics. Nupedia, by the time it shut in 2003, had finished just 25.
That side project, Wikipedia, now has more than 55m articles across 300 languages. With 1.7bn unique visitors a month, it is the 13th most popular website on the internet, according to Amazon’s monitoring site, Alexa Internet, and the only one in the top 50 to be run on an entirely non-commercial basis (bbc.co.uk just outranks it among UK users). The encyclopaedia’s foundational model attracted criticism from day one. Without experts writers or professional editors, many wondered, how could it ensure accuracy? By 2006, as the site celebrated its fifth anniversary, it was the subject of mockery in the mainstream press. One article cited the encyclopaedia’s claim that “David Beckham was a Chinese goalkeeper in the 18th century” to highlight a “comedy of errors”. Even in 2006, that particular piece of vandalism was fixed within 11 minutes. These days, Wikipedia has a few more tools to prevent such abuse. The article about Beckham is one of many that is “semi-protected”, a status that prevents unregistered users from editing it – a concession to the reality that not everyone on the internet is interested in contributing to a collective endeavour.
But as the site continues to flourish even as the online environment has transformed, it raises a different set of questions from those of its early doubters. Wikipedia, as one joke goes, works in practice, which is good, because it definitely doesn’t work in theory. Why has the site succeeded in building a positive online community where so many others have failed? Jimmy Wales, its co-founder, cites two things as making the key difference. “First, everyone knows what an encyclopedia is. If I say ‘encyclopedia article about the Eiffel Tower’, we all know what that should be, so if we set out to write that, we know where we are going and what it should be like. Second, we never regarded Wikipedia as a wide-open free speech forum, it’s a project to build an encyclopedia. So we try to avoid (as much as we can, we are humans) the typical round and round flame wars of social media.” “Wikipedia has issues in the same way that any large institution has issues, but it’s undoubtedly a remarkable achievement,” says Abigail Brady, a long-term editor on the site. “In some ways it’s a relic – it dates from a pre-social media era of the web where idealistic attempts to create large collaborative works were just starting. “I think the key to its long-term success has been its lack of commercialisation. Jimmy Wales made a decision that Wikipedia should be non-profit very early on, and stuck to it. There are no ads (beyond the odd pledge drive), and no sense that your labour is being farmed by a company too cheapskate to actually pay people to do data entry. It is a genuine collaborative project.”
As Wikipedia has grown, it has moved beyond simple encyclopaedia-style articles. The community’s best points are now visible at times of great upheaval, when collaborative editing allows hundreds of people to work on pulling together an authoritative overview of breaking news events before the events have even finished. At 6.34pm UK time on 6 January this year, one Wikipedia editor, with the username Another Believer, decided that events in Washington looked important enough to warrant an article. Tentatively titled “January 2021 Donald Trump rally”, the initial entry was brief: “On 6 January 2021, thousands of Donald Trump supporters gathered in Washington DC to reject results of the November 2020 presidential election.”
One minute later, the Guardian’s live blog reported: “House offices evacuated as Trump supporters storm Capitol barriers.” Over the next half-hour, Another Believer continued to update their article alone. Slowly, other administrators began to join in, and the article became the site’s key focus for those documenting the rapidly evolving events in Washington. By midnight UK time, the article was 3,000 words long, with a further 3,000 words of footnotes, and a debate was raging over whether to rename it from its latest title, “2021 United States Capitol protests”, to its current headline, “2021 storming of the United States Capitol”. The collaborative encyclopaedia still has many barriers to overcome, from an ever-present funding crisis, only partially solved by its donation-driven revenue model, to its undesired role as a silent battlefield for professionally run influence campaigns to rehabilitate reputations, or excise controversy from the internet. And it still faces the same pressures that more conventional reference sources do, as it struggles to represent the history of the world with less of a focus on the white, male wealthy figures who make up so much of recorded history. But 20 years on, it is difficult to deny that Wikipedia has proved the naysayers wrong. Whether it is the last gasp of a vision of the internet that has all but died out, or a shining beacon lighting the way to a better future, remains to be seen."
2021-01-14T15:00:40Z,technology,Technology,Samsung Galaxy S21 launch: 10x superzoom camera phone unveiled,"Samsung is attempting to fully replace high-end cameras and out-zoom its smartphone competition with the new Galaxy S21 Ultra, the firm’s first to feature a large 10x optical zoom. Announced as part of the company’s Unpacked live-streamed event, the new £1,149 Android superphone has two different optical zoom lenses for switching between 3x and 10x magnification. It leads Samsung’s Galaxy S21 line for 2021 which also includes two smaller and cheaper models. The phones each have 20% faster processors than the S20 series last year, up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, plus faster fingerprint scanners in their screens. Galaxy S21 Ultra
The Galaxy S21 Ultra is the largest of the bunch with a 6.8in 120Hz OLED screen, a big battery, and a glass and metal body with a new camera cluster design that wraps around the side of the device. It is the quad camera system that sets the phone apart from the competition. It has an ultra-wide camera, a 108-megapixel main camera and two 10-megapixel telephoto cameras with differing lengths of optical zoom – a first for the company and rivalling Huawei’s P40 Pro Plus from last year. One camera has a 3x optical zoom for photographing objects that are relatively close, while a second camera has a 10x optical zoom lens for extended magnifications. Samsung’s digital “Space Zoom” system then takes the magnification up to 100x. The camera system can also shoot 4K video at 60 frames a second across all lenses for the first time, something rival Apple has made a headline feature of its iPhone in recent years. “Apple regularly sets the benchmark for photography and video on smartphones, but one area where Samsung has a competitive edge is zoom capabilities on its cameras,” said Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight. “It is good to see further improvements to Samsung’s Space Zoom feature and as well as 3X optical zoom on the S21/S21+ and 10X optical zoom on the S21 Ultra.” The S21 Ultra is also the first in the S-line to be compatible with the S Pen stylus, something previously reserved for Samsung’s largest Galaxy Note and tablet lines. Galaxy S21 and S21+
Sitting below the Ultra, the S21 and S21+ have 6.2in and 6.7in 120Hz OLED screens. The smaller models also feature Samsung’s new camera cluster design but they only have triple cameras on the back with ultra wide, main and one telephoto lens. All three new phones will be available from 29 January with the Galaxy S21 costing from £769 and the S21+ from £949. Galaxy Buds Pro
Alongside the phones, Samsung also announced a new set of its well-received and popular true wireless earbuds. The Galaxy Buds Pro merge the design of the Galaxy Buds+ and the recent Galaxy Buds Live creating fairly small earbuds with traditional silicone ear tips and a small charging case. The earbuds have active noise cancelling, separate 11mm woofer and 6.5mm tweeter speakers and IPX7 water resistance. They support seamless switching and spatial audio virtual surround sound with Dolby Head Tracking technology, similar to that offered by Apple with its AirPods Pro. They last up to 18 hours with noise cancelling active and are made of 20% recycled materials. The Galaxy Buds Pro will cost £219 available from the 29 January."
2021-01-14T05:43:50Z,technology,Technology,One third of Australian users have not updated Covidsafe app,"Nearly one third of the seven million Australians who downloaded the Covidsafe app have not updated to the most recent version, as new figures show the government spend on the contact tracing app has risen to $14m. The Covidsafe contact tracing app relies on as many people as possible running it, but new data reveals that more than two million users do not have the most up-to-date version. In the nine months since the federal government launched the app, it has only identified 17 close contacts that were not found through manual contact tracing methods, all of them in New South Wales.
Part of the reason for the app’s lack of success in identifying contacts could be that almost one third could be using an older version, if they are still using the app. Since April, there have been a dozen software updates pushed out to fix bugs, security flaws, and make the app work more effectively on iPhones when the screen is locked. The Digital Transformation Agency – which is responsible for the development of the app – told a Senate estimates committee in response to questions on notice that as of the end of October last year, 66% of users had the most up-to-date version, including 63% of iPhone users, and 74% of Android users. Guardian Australia has asked DTA whether this figure had changed in the past few months. The Covidsafe app routinely sends push notifications telling users to “improve the performance of the app” by opening the app and ensuring the phone is connected to the internet. Labor’s acting shadow communications minister, Tim Watts, said the government should have been urging people to update the app from the start. “Instead they rushed the rollout because Scott Morrison wanted an announcement to beat the Apple and Google solutions and refuse to admit they bungled it,” he said. “Seven million Australians did their bit and downloaded the app, but 2.1 million of them are currently left exposed in the sun because Scott Morrison doesn’t want to look bad politically.” The agency was also asked in Senate estimates how many of the 7.1 million who downloaded the app initially continued to run it on their phones, but the agency claimed it did not record such information. “At present, the DTA does not measure active users because, as required under the Privacy Impact Assessment, the DTA does not track information about which users have the app open and running, or where any users are located.” However, the DTA does get regular analytics and usage data reports, including information on the number of users running the app. Last year DTA refused a freedom of information request from Guardian Australia for this information on the grounds it would compromise public safety. Guardian Australia has appealed the decision. DTA denied it had misled the Senate, telling Guardian Australia the information provided was correct.
The app has so far cost $7.1m to develop and run, with the largest share of the money going to Amazon which was paid $2.4m for professional services, development and ongoing usage fees. Technology consultants Shine Solutions has received $1.9m, while tech companies Delv earned $1.7m, Cevo $1m, and Boston Consulting Group $800,000. The department of health also told Senate estimates that it has spent $6.9 m on advertising the app, taking the total cost of the app to $14m. When the app was launched, prime minister Scott Morrison referred to the app as a form of “sunscreen” necessary to have in place before easing restrictions. However, contact tracing apps have had limited success across the world. Many jurisdictions, including in Australia have adopted QR code venue check-ins as a better way to keep track of where people have been. Many tech experts have argued that the Australian government should switch to an Apple-Google exposure notification framework to fix issues with Covidsafe, but the government has so far resisted. Government services minister Stuart Robert said the government was concerned the Apple/Google version would bypass contact tracers, because the app’s default is to alert close contacts directly. The framework can, however, be modified to allow the contact details of users – with their consent – to be provided to contact tracers in the event they’re identified as a close contact. The BBC reported earlier this week that only about two in five people in Scotland who tested positive to Covid-19 and had the Protect Scotland app – which uses the Apple/Google exposure notification framework – had chosen to alert their close contacts through the app."
2021-01-14T02:16:35Z,technology,Technology,Twitter chief says Trump ban was right decision but sets 'dangerous precedent',"Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, has said that banning Donald Trump from the platform was the “right decision” but that it sets a dangerous precedent.
Speaking out for the first time since the social network took the remarkable step of permanently suspending the president’s account following a violent attack on the US Capitol, Dorsey said the company faced “an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety”. “I do not celebrate or feel pride in our having to ban @realDonaldTrump from Twitter, or how we got here,” Dorsey admitted on Wednesday in an extended Twitter thread. “I feel a ban is a failure of ours, ultimately, to promote healthy conversation. And a time for us to reflect on our operations and the environment around us.” Dorsey said that it was the right decision for the company but that such actions “fragment the public conversation”. “They divide us,” he continued. “They limit the potential for clarification, redemption, and learning. And sets a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation.”
Last week Twitter suspended the president, who was impeached for the second time on Wedneday for inciting a mob of his supporters, due to “the risk of further incitement of violence”. The decision comes as other big tech companies, including Facebook, Reddit, Pinterest, and YouTube have suspended Trump’s accounts temporarily and in some cases permanently over the attack. Silicon Valley has faced a reckoning over its role in spreading disinformation and serving as a platform for planning the insurrection. For years, Dorsey has resisted moderating high-profile users of the platform, arguing that the public has the right to hear from newsworthy figures. But in 2020 it began to flag tweets from Trump for misinformation, disable the ability to retweet except when adding commentary, and in some cases removed tweets that appeared to incite violence. Twitter had also in the months surrounding the US presidential elections tested a number of policies to limit the spread of hate speech and misinformation. Still, it faced criticism for failing to address the growing danger posed by Trump’s account, which boiled over after the president incited a mob to storm the Capitol building on 6 January. Following the violent events, which left five dead, Trump tweeted what appeared to be an explanation or justification for the mob while continuing to push a false narrative that the election was not legitimate, saying: “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously and viciously stripped away.” On Friday, Trump’s account was permanently suspended. The president frantically jumped from account to account, attempting to tweet from @POTUS and his campaign account @TeamTrump before those outlets were restricted for him as well. Twitter explained its reasoning for removing Trump in an extensive blogpost on Friday evening. It said tweets from Trump could easily be interpreted as encouragement or justification to “replicate the violent acts that took place on January 6, 2021”. Dorsey underscored in his tweets a need for a new “open decentralized standard for social media”. “It’s important that we acknowledge this is a time of great uncertainty and struggle for so many around the world,” he said. “Our goal in this moment is to disarm as much as we can, and ensure we are all building towards a greater common understanding, and a more peaceful existence on earth.” Reuters contributed to this report"
2021-01-13T11:14:36Z,technology,Technology,TikTok to tackle grooming with safeguards for young users,"Children on TikTok will face “groundbreaking” new restrictions in an attempt to prevent grooming on the platform, the video-sharing company has announced, with particularly strict new rules for users under 16. The platform, which has a lower age limit of 13, said users under 16 would no longer be able to receive comments from strangers, have their videos used for “duets” or mark their posts as available to be downloaded. Their accounts will default to “private”, which prevents anyone other than friends from viewing their videos. The company is also changing the default settings across the app for users under 18. Unless they actively change the settings, 16- and 17-year-olds will also have their videos made unavailable for download, and only friends will be able to record duets. “The groundbreaking changes announced today mark the next step in our mission to ensure TikTok is a safe platform for all our users,” said Alexandra Evans, TikTok’s European head of child safety. “They build on previous changes we’ve made to promote minor safety, including restricting direct messaging and hosting livestreams to [users aged] 16 and over and enabling parents and caregivers to set guardrails for their teen’s TikTok account through our Family Pairing feature.
“We know there is no finish line when it comes to minor safety, and that is why we are continuously evolving our policies and investing in our technology and human-moderation teams so that TikTok remains a safe place for all our users to express their creativity.” NSPCC welcomed the changes. Andy Burrows, the charity’s head of child safety online policy, said: “This is a bold package of measures by TikTok and a hugely welcome step that will reduce opportunities for groomers to contact children. It comes as abusers are taking advantage of the pandemic to target children spending more time online, and we urge other platforms to be similarly proactive rather than wait for regulation to come into effect. “The full benefits of these changes will be felt when age assurance measures are put in place in September when the age appropriate design code comes into force.” The changes to the app will affect tens of millions of TikTok’s young userbase, and suggest the company is comfortable with the fact that restricting some of its most popular features will not cause teens to desert the app for competitors such as Snapchat and Instagram. Duets in particular have become a core feature of TikTok in recent months. The feature allows users to record a video of themselves alongside another user’s post. As well as creating YouTube-style “reaction” videos and two-handed comedy skits, the feature has led to the creation of organically produced musical hits. In October, one post of a hypothetical song from a musical version of the Pixar film Ratatouille became, through the duet feature, a full-blown Broadway-style musical that was eventually filmed and aired by Disney. This week a single post of a user singing Wellerman, a traditional sea shanty, was duetted with multiple times until a full a cappella version of the song became one of the platform’s most popular videos. • This article was amended on 14 January 2021. The accounts of users aged under 16 will default to “private”, not those of under-18s as stated in an earlier version."
2021-01-13T08:12:20Z,technology,Technology,Google admits to running 'experiments' which remove some media sites from its search results,"Google has been hiding some Australian news sites from search results, in a move media outlets say is a show of “extraordinary power” as the tech company bargains with the Australian government over financial payment for content. The Australian government is attempting to impose a new code on Google and Facebook that would force them to negotiate a fair price for displaying local news content. Google has criticised the proposed code – which would be a world first – in messages to the search engine’s users while Facebook has warned it could block Australians from sharing local news as a consequence. The Australian Financial Review on Wednesday reported that Google had tweaked its search and news algorithm to bury links to some commercial Australian media outlets for some users.
A Google spokesperson confirmed the company was “running a few experiments that will each reach about 1% of Google Search users in Australia to measure the impacts of news businesses and Google Search on each other”. The experiments would finish by early February, he told Guardian Australia. Google sought to downplay the significance of the move by noting the company conducted “tens of thousands of experiments in Google Search” every year. “In 2018, the value we provided to publishers through referral traffic alone was estimated at $218m,” the spokesperson said. “We remain committed to getting to a workable code and look forward to working with the Senate committee, policymakers and publishers to achieve an outcome that’s fair for everyone, in the interests of all Australians.” Anecdotal evidence from Guardian Australia readers appeared to confirm that when logged into a Google account, the Guardian Australia website did not appear in search results, which instead returned the Guardian’s Twitter, Facebook and Wikipedia pages. Nine, the publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the AFR, said the result of searches delivered to some Google users “makes it starkly clear that trusted local news is critical to Google’s products”. “Google is an effective monopoly and by withholding access to such timely, accurate and important information they show clearly how they impact what access Australians have to that,” a spokesperson said. “At the same time, Google are now demonstrating how easily they can make Australian news providers who fall out of their favour effectively disappear from the internet – a chilling illustration of their extraordinary market power.”
On Tuesday, Mel Silva, the vice-president for Google Australia and New Zealand, claimed that the “overwhelming majority” of submitters to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s consultations had “concerns about key aspects of the code or are downright opposed to it”. Silva said that Google had accepted arbitration as a “reasonable backstop” to secure investment in news. But the search giant has warned the ACCC’s model is flawed because it considers only news companies’ costs and not Google’s – and encourages “ambit claims”. Google has also rejected fundamental elements of the code as unworkable, including that it “forces Google to pay to show links in an unprecedented intervention that would fundamentally break how search engines work”, and that it would give news companies “special treatment” in the form of 14 days’ notice of certain changes to algorithms. Note: Guardian Australia has been in discussion with Google over inclusion in its new “Showcase” offering that would see the company pay news providers for inclusion in this product."
2021-01-12T19:19:31Z,technology,Technology,Programmer has two guesses left to access Â£175m bitcoin wallet,"Stefan Thomas has just two chances left to get his hands on his $240m (£175m) fortune. Thomas is a San Francisco-based computer programmer, and a decade ago he was given 7,002 bitcoins as a reward for making a video explaining how the cryptocurrency works. At the time he was paid, they were worth $2-$6 each. He stashed them away in his “digital wallet” and forgot about them. Now each bitcoin is worth $34,000, and the contents of his wallet are valued at $240m. But Thomas has forgotten the password that will unlock his fortune. German-born Thomas has already entered the wrong password eight times, and if he guesses wrong two more times his hard drive, which contains his private keys to the bitcoin, will be encrypted – and he’ll never see the money.
The price of bitcoin hit more than $40,000 last week, having doubled in less than a month. It has since fallen back but it is still up by more than 700% since the pandemic was first declared in March last year, rising from about $5,000. Thomas said he has tried his eight most frequently used passwords to access his IronKey hard drive, but all turned out to be wrong. The device auto-encrypts all contents after the 10th inaccurate guess. “I would just lay in bed and think about it,” Thomas told the New York Times. “Then I would go to the computer with some new strategy, and it wouldn’t work, and I would be desperate again.” Thomas said the experience has understandably put him off cryptocurrencies. “This whole idea of being your own bank – let me put it this way, do you make your own shoes?” he said. “The reason we have banks is that we don’t want to deal with all those things that banks do.”
Following the publicity of Thomas’s plight, Alex Stamos, an internet security expert at Stanford Internet Observatory, said he could crack the password within six months if Thomas gave him a 10% cut of the digital fortune. “Um, for $220m in locked-up bitcoin, you don’t make 10 password guesses but take it to professionals to buy 20 IronKeys and spend six months finding a side-channel or uncapping,” he said on Twitter. “I’ll make it happen for 10%. Call me.”
Cryptocurrency data firm Chainalysis said it estimated that about 20% of the existing 18.5m bitcoins appears to be lost or stranded in inaccessible wallets. In 2013, Welsh IT worker James Howells accidentally threw out a hard drive containing the keys to 7,500 bitcoins. At the time, the lost bitcoins were worth about £4m. Now, they would be worth more than $250m."
2021-01-12T05:06:59Z,technology,Technology,"Twitter suspends 70,000 accounts sharing QAnon content","Twitter has said it has suspended more than 70,000 accounts since Friday that were primarily dedicated to sharing QAnon content as the social media site continued to crack down on content after supporters of Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol. “Given the violent events in Washington DC, and increased risk of harm, we began permanently suspending thousands of accounts that were primarily dedicated to sharing QAnon content on Friday afternoon,” Twitter said in a blog late on Monday. “These accounts were engaged in sharing harmful QAnon-associated content at scale and were primarily dedicated to the propagation of this conspiracy theory across the service,” the company said.
Twitter said the move could result in some accounts losing thousands of followers. “Our updated enforcement on QAnon content on Twitter, along with routine spam challenges, has resulted in changes in follower count for some people’s Twitter accounts. In some cases, these actions may have resulted in follower count changes in the thousands.” QAnon backers have pushed conspiracies on social media that include the baseless claim that Trump secretly is fighting a cabal of child-sex predators, among them prominent Democrats, figures in Hollywood and “deep state” allies. On Monday, Amazon said it was working to remove some QAnon products from its online marketplace, citing policies that prohibit offensive inappropriate items. The world’s largest online retailer drew scrutiny for having apparel with QAnon insignia and related books up for sale days after last week’s attack on the US Capitol. Twitter had said on Friday it would permanently suspend accounts pushing QAnon content, banning prominent right-wing boosters of its conspiracy theories. Shares in Twitter dropped sharply after it permanently suspended Trump following the attack on the US Capitol last week. The social media company lost $5bn in market value as investors took fright at potential tougher future regulation for the site. The storming of the Capitol building last week by Trump supporters delayed the certification of Joe Biden’s election victory. Lawmakers were forced to flee, as the building was mobbed by the president’s supporters who overwhelmed security forces. Five people died in the violence including one Capitol Police officer who was beaten as he tried to ward off the crowds."
2021-01-12T02:52:11Z,technology,Technology,Facebook targets 'stop the steal' content and says Trump ban may be permanent,"Facebook is cracking down on content using the phrase “stop the steal”, the rallying cry of Donald Trump supporters who claim without evidence that there was voter fraud in the 2020 elections. Content supporting the “stop the steal” movement will be removed from the platform, while posts containing the phrase to either condemn it or discuss the topic neutrally will be allowed to remain. The policy change is the latest effort to target misinformation and the incitement of violence on Facebook, after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building on Wednesday. Social media platforms such as Facebook have traditionally taken a light touch to policing speech posted by politicians, maintaining that people have a right to see statements from their leaders.
But following the riot, social media platforms including Facebook removed Trump’s account and tightened enforcement around misinformation policies. “With continued attempts to organize events against the outcome of the US presidential election that can lead to violence, and use of the [“stop the steal”] term by those involved in Wednesday’s violence in DC, we’re taking this additional step in the lead-up to the inauguration,” Facebook said in a blog post. On Monday, Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said that Trump’s account will be suspended until at least the inauguration and perhaps longer. Sandberg, speaking to Reuters, said the company has no plans to lift its block on Trump’s accounts and that she was “glad” that Facebook had taken the action. “This shows the president is not above the policies we have,” Sandberg said. Meanwhile, Twitter permanently banned the president on Friday. The company also said Monday it will continue its ban of political advertising in the US, including any ads paid for by Trump or his allies. Social media companies have rushed to limit the president’s posts following the violence last week. Trump has been banned from Twitter and removed from Facebook, Reddit, YouTube, Pinterest, and TikTok. The efforts follow years of false and hateful claims by the president on social media, with many denouncing the heavy-handed crackdown as too little, too late. On Monday, the home exercise company Peloton announced it will also be banning the hashtag #stopthesteal from being used. Alternative social platforms more sympathetic to Trump such as Parler are facing more widespread action. Amazon announced it would suspend Parler from AWS, its hosting service. Parler was also booted from the app store on both Apple and Google devices. Meanwhile, Twitter has been increasing its enforcement of policies to protect its service from “attempts to incite violence, organize attacks, and share deliberately misleading information about the election outcome”. This includes content relating to QAnon, an unsubstantiated pro-Trump conspiracy theory. Since Friday, Twitter says it had removed 70,000 accounts that were primarily dedicated to QAnon. This comes after the platform banned accounts of a number of prominent QAnon influencers following the insurrection on Wednesday."
2021-01-11T15:34:15Z,technology,Technology,What is bitcoin and why are so many people looking to buy it? | Richard Partington,"What is bitcoin? Bitcoin is a type of digital currency that emerged after the 2008 financial crisis. It allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment methods. It has become the most prominent among thousands of so-called cryptocurrencies. It relies on “blockchain” technology, which is a shared database of transactions, with entries that must be confirmed and encrypted. The network is secured by individuals called “miners” who use high-powered computers to verify transactions, with bitcoins offered as a reward. There are more than 18m in existence, and the mathematical system controlling the generation of new bitcoins – which is decentralised and therefore has no overarching institution such as a central bank – has a hardwired maximum of 21m coins.
How do you buy and sell it? There are several currency exchanges where consumers can swap traditional “fiat” money – backed by governments – for cryptocurrencies, which must be stored using a digital wallet. Some of the biggest exchanges include Bitstamp, Coinbase and Gemini. However, finance firms have also created new investment products based on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, such as contracts for difference, which are used to track the value of an asset without needing to directly own it. What can you buy with it? There are problems when it comes to using bitcoin as a currency, with many people simply owning it as a speculative investment instead, given its tendency for extreme swings in value. Within the space of a single hour on Monday alone, its value fell by about $3,000 (£2,230), then rose again by about $2,000. This makes it almost impossible to put a reliable price on goods and services. Instead, there are ways to pay using applications such as BitPay, which converts bitcoin funds in a digital wallet to pay for goods in traditional currencies used by retailers. Transactions are growing, more so online than in physical shops, with firms including Microsoft, Lush and Expedia accepting payments. The first-ever bitcoin transaction was made in 2010, when a Florida man paid a British man 10,000 bitcoins to order him two Papa John’s pizzas. Today that would be worth more than $300m.
Why is the FCA warning on cryptocurrencies The City regulator is concerned crypto investment firms could be overstating potential payouts, or understating the risks, from investing in bitcoin and products related to the digital currency. As a newer and relatively lightly regulated market, consumers are unlikely to have access to state-backed compensation if something goes wrong. There has also been a boom in bitcoin scams. Why are people buying it right now? There are three main factors influencing the bitcoin price. First, the media frenzy over its boom in value, drawing in new buyers looking to make money. Second, more traditional finance firms are investing in the market. And finally, comparisons between bitcoin and gold, which fit with trends in the global economy. The development of Covid-19 vaccines could enable a swift economic recovery from the pandemic, at a time when governments and central banks are still providing vast amounts of emergency support – which could trigger a burst of inflation. Some investors view bitcoin as a store of value, similar to gold, which can hold its worth during times of economic stress or rising inflation. Can its rise be maintained? Bitcoin’s value is almost entirely defined by perceptions. Some economists believe it is entirely worthless. However, analysts at JP Morgan have said it could hit $146,000 if it became as established as gold for investors. However, to match this reputation built up over millennia – as a thing worth owning, with otherwise little intrinsic value – it would need to become much less volatile."
2021-01-10T17:21:34Z,technology,Technology,'Hang Mike Pence': Twitter stops phrase trending after Capitol riot,"Twitter stopped the phrase “Hang Mike Pence” trending on Saturday, but not before it trended on the social media platform in the aftermath of the company’s decision to suspend Donald Trump’s account.
The chant was heard in the US Capitol on Wednesday, as a mob incited by the president attempted a putsch, roaming the halls, confronting law enforcement and in some cases apparently planning to kidnap lawmakers. Jim Bourg, a Reuters picture editor in Washington, said on Twitter: “I heard at least three different rioters at the Capitol say that they hoped to find Vice-President Mike Pence and execute him by hanging him from a Capitol Hill tree as a traitor. It was a common line being repeated. Many more were just talking about how the VP should be executed.” Five people died as a result of the attack , including a Capitol police officer reportedly struck with a fire extinguisher and a rioter shot by law enforcement. Multiple arrests were made, among them men who brought firearms and explosives to Washington. Twitter suspended Trump’s account late on Friday, over his incitement of the mob. Pence was at the Capitol at the time of the riot, to preside over the counting of electoral college results which Trump has tried to overturn, claiming without evidence that his defeat by Joe Biden was the result of electoral fraud. The president repeatedly tweeted claims that Pence had the authority to overturn the results. He did not. Trump supporters outside the Capitol brandished a gallows and noose. Inside, lawmakers hid from rioters who invaded offices and the House and Senate chambers. One member of the mob, a retired air force officer, was pictured carrying plastic “zip tie” handcuffs.
In a statement on Saturday, a Twitter spokesman said: “We blocked the phrase and other variations of it from trending.
“We want trends to promote healthy discussions on Twitter. This means that at times, we may prevent certain content from trending. As per our Help Center, there are rules for trends – if we identify accounts that violate these rules, we’ll take enforcement action.” After the Capitol was secured, Pence presided over the confirmation of Joe Biden’s election victory. Since then, the vice-president has been the subject of calls to invoke the 25th amendment to the constitution, which provides for the removal of a president deemed incapable of fulfilling his duties. On Sunday, NBC News reported that Pence and Trump had not spoken since the Capitol riot."
2021-01-10T08:45:46Z,technology,Technology,Art meets tech to mark first 100 years of the robot,"“Listen Josef,” said the Czech playwright Karel Čapek to his brother. “I have an idea for a play.” Josef, an artist of some renown, was painting furiously and unimpressed by his brother’s intrusion. “What kind of play?” he asked, sharply. Karel set out the plot. In the future, humans have created synthetic, humanoid creatures to increase productivity in the factories and fight wars on the battlefield. Built as slave workers, they will eventually rise up and wipe out the human race. Josef was indifferent to the idea. “Then write it!” he said. But Karel was stuck. He could not think of the appropriate word to describe his artificial workers. “Call them roboti,” said Josef. This was the Czech word for serf or forced labourer. Karel decided the word robot was a perfect fit. The play, Rossum’s Universal Robots (RUR), premiered in Prague in January 1921. The exchange with his brother was relayed by Karel Čapek in a newspaper some years later, reflecting on how he introduced the word robot to the world when the play premiered in January 2021 – now exactly 100 years ago. The play was a hit. An original work of science fiction, it fed into early 20th-century fears about technology’s role in the drive for mass production after the first world war. RUR’s bold and nightmarish vision of a future where humanity is under threat by robots caused a sensation. Kara Reilly is an academic, dramaturgist and author of Automata and Mimesis on the Stage of Theatre History. In her book, she says: “Everyone in the audience would have known someone who died as a result of the war, and the idea of robot replacements for soldiers would have been compelling. “With its use of tanks, zeppelins and photographic imagery, the first world war was a showcase for emerging technology. It made people suddenly aware of the very real possibility of the destruction of the human race by its own machine-based creations.” Čapek’s robots furthered the debate as to whether technology might liberate workers and eradicate manual labour. As Reilly remarks: “These slaves have the potential to transform the world into a paradise for human beings. In part, RUR interrogates and satirises that modernist struggle between capital and labour to forge a workers’ paradise.” The first English translation arrived on Broadway in 1922, featuring a young Spencer Tracy. A year later, it was playing in the West End at St Martin’s theatre, with one reviewer in the Pall Mall Gazette commenting: “The Robots are made quite haunting with their heavy expressionless faces and automaton gestures. As one comes out, poor soulless Robots seem still to be crowding round – in the street, the tube lift, the strap hung train. Curious effect! Can it be true?”
RUR was both captivating and terrifying to audiences. In 1927, it was the first full-length play to be aired in its entirety by the BBC, and later, in 1938, it became the world’s first televised piece of science fiction when a half-hour programme went out live on the BBC. “I do think the ideas in RUR have continued to influence sciencefiction culture, even on a unconscious level,” says award-winning, bestselling science fiction author Stephen Baxter. “Čapek’s robots rebelled, as have robots ever since, from The Terminator to The Simpsons. “Nowadays we think more of possibly disembodied AI’s rather than humanoids, but the moral dilemmas are the same. How do you control robots? I don’t believe Čapek thought all this through consciously but he gave us a fable, almost a biblical parable, to enable us to explore such issues. Coining the word ‘robot’ was a new idea to explore in both fiction and science itself.” While Čapek’s invention of the ‘robot’ proved to be culturally and scientifically significant, RUR’s popularity faded, and today the play is largely unknown. Caitriona McLaughlin is an Irish theatre director who directed the Irish National Youth Theatre’s 2017 production of RUR at the Abbey theatre in Dublin. “I was looking for a play that attempts to articulate who we are as a species and what sort of moral code we want to set for ourselves,” she explains. “RUR tapped into some very contemporary themes that I knew a young cast would respond to, in particular an over-reliance on technology.” The theme of uprising and revolt also provided an important cultural backdrop to the production. “We were working on the play amid a series of centenary commemorations marking the Easter Rising in Ireland and the lead-up to the formation of the Irish state, so it felt weirdly apposite.” But, as McLaughlin discovered, interpreting a century-old science fiction play for a 21st-century audience presents its own challenges. “The text itself was a little dated, and we needed to find a way of building a view of the future created in the past that still looked like the actual future.” Čapek’s humanoid robot workers and futuristic island setting provide artists and directors an opportunity to assemble distinctive stage designs. “Our set and costume designers created a world which was satisfyingly retro, but still otherworldly enough to support the production,” says McCoughlin. “The overall design concept became the lens through which we could explore some very existential questions about humanity.” It’s easy to see how RUR has influenced science fiction storytelling, from Philip K Dick’s androids dreaming of electric sheep to Arnold Schwarzenegger’s perpetually returning terminator. There is even a Rocky Horror Picture Show-style rock musical inspired by RUR. Rob Susman, creator of Save the Robots, says: “It was a play I read in school that always stuck with me.” Although, as co-writer Jacques Lamarre points out, the overt campness wasn’t necessarily apparent in Čapek’s original. “Our version goes a little further by having the scientists wearing leather and panties,” he says. RUR also featured in the burgeoning career of a British film icon. In 1986, Michael Caine appeared on the Wogan show and told how his father, a fishmonger, had advised him: “‘Never do a job where you can be replaced by a machine” [pause]. So I became an actor [laughter]. And the first play I ever did, I played a robot [more laughter]. Very esoteric in the amateur dramatics society, it was a play called Rossum’s Universal Robots, RUR. A critic in the South London Press said, Mr Caine was very convincing as a robot.” To commemorate RUR’s centenary, a Prague-based project, TheAItre, will stream a live performance of the first play ever written by robots. It will be available, for free, on 26 Febuary. TheAItre is a collaboration between AI programmers, researchers and theatre representatives, who ask the question: do you think artificial intelligence is able to create a theatre script? Can it write a play about its own father, Karel Čapek, who wrote about robots 100 years ago? Rudolf Rosa, a robopsychology expert from Charles University in Prague, has been using the nickname RUR since his schooldays and was asked to lead the project. Technically, it won’t be robots writing the play, because as Rosa explained in a recent interview, “while robots exist and are used, unlike classical ideas, they are not very intelligent in themselves. The intelligence is usually hidden elsewhere, in powerful computers and servers in data centres. Robots are more like puppets.” Čapek’s robots acted as a warning rather than a prediction. RUR asked that we consider where a relentless pursuit of technological progress might lead humanity. Today, 100 years later, humanity, for the most part, remains firmly in control of its machines. But, who knows, perhaps RUR’s 200-year anniversary will see both humans and robots joining in the celebrations."
2021-01-09T16:00:25Z,technology,Technology,Bitcoin boom threatens to turn it into pure gold,"Bitcoin is back, along with the debate over its value. The price of the digital currency is soaring and last week it hit more than $40,000 for the first time, having doubled in less than a month. Its price has jumped by more than 700% since the pandemic was first declared in March last year, rising from about $5,000. But breathless headlines are nothing new for the 12-year-old cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has been here before, in the previous decade, when it went on a tear with a predictable outcome. Drawing parallels with the tulip mania of the 17th century, bitcoin soared from just below $1,000 at the start of 2017 to come close to $20,000 within 12 months, then crashed to about $3,000 within a few weeks in early 2018.
Back then, most mainstream investors, central bankers and financiers wrote it off as a dangerous, anonymous instrument for fraudsters and terrorists, warning it was a disaster waiting to happen for unwitting punters who risked being dragged in. Among its biggest critics at the time, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, labelled it a “fraud” that would blow up, telling a conference of bankers in late 2017: “If you’re stupid enough to buy it, you’ll pay the price for it one day.” There are more than 18 million bitcoins now in existence, generated by “miners” who also provide the computational power underpinning the blockchain, a digital ledger maintained by thousands of computers worldwide that records transactions made using the currency. The mathematical system that generates new bitcoins – which is decentralised and therefore has no controlling institution such as a central bank – has a hardwired maximum of 21 million coins. Far from blowing up, anyone who chose to “hodl” – or hold on to bitcoin, in the slang of its legion of online supporters – could have made enough money to make even America’s highest-paid banking executive blush. Dimon’s own daughter was among owners, emailing him after his “stupid” comment to say she held two bitcoins. Today that modest holding would be worth more than $80,000. This time around, Dimon and the rest of Wall Street is changing its tune, with growing numbers of major institutional investors, hedge funds and pensions money managers buying in. While still saying it’s “not my cup of tea”, Dimon admitted last month that some “very smart people” were getting involved. Once viewed as an anti-establishment, anarchist project to overthrow modern capitalism, bitcoin buyers now include pillars of the financial elite on Wall Street and in the City, including firms such as the UK fund manager Ruffer. Analysts say three main factors are driving the bitcoin price. First, the media frenzy around the latest boom in the digital currency has drawn in speculative buyers. Second, the involvement of traditional money managers is burgeoning in a maturing market. And finally, big players are viewing it as a protection against inflation.
Expectations are mounting for stronger growth in average consumer prices, amid hopes that the coronavirus vaccine will spur a rapid economic recovery at a time when central banks are still pumping billions of pounds into their economies via quantitative easing. Inflation would erode the value of “fiat” currencies – money backed by governments – making digital currencies a potentially attractive proposition. In the past, investors have bought assets such as gold, which are perceived as ways to insure against inflation because they tend to hold their value during times of economic stress. This time around, some analysts argue bitcoin could rival precious metals as an alternative. Since October, more than $3bn (£2.2bn) has been invested into Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, an investment vehicle which tracks the value of bitcoin. Analysts at JPMorgan have said bitcoins could be worth as much as $146,000 apiece if they were to become as established as gold. Comparing the digital currency to the precious metal, it said bitcoin would need to rise by more than four times to match the $2.7tn value of gold owned by private investors. This would mean “implying a theoretical bitcoin price of $146k,” it said. However, to match the perceived value of gold – established over millennia as a thing worth owning – the currency would need to become much less volatile, according to Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the analyst who wrote the research. He said bitcoin had probably now hit its peak for the year, and could suffer a sharp drop if it ballooned any further. “If anything, the speculative money that is currently happening is pushing up the volatility of bitcoin. In a way, that is actually delaying its convergence with gold, which is key for its sustainability. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there is not some correction. How big that correction is depends on how far it goes. If it goes to $100,000, I think the correction is going to be big.”"
2021-01-09T08:00:16Z,technology,Technology,Bill Gates joins Blackstone in bid to buy British private jet services firm,"Bill Gates has joined a £3bn bidding war to buy the world’s largest private jet services company just as he prepares to publish his new book How to Avoid a Climate Disaster. Cascade Investment, the fund that manages much of Gates’s $134bn personal fortune, announced on Friday it had teamed up with US private equity firm Blackstone in a bid for the British firm Signature Aviation. The Cascade and Blackstone offer came just hours after rival American private equity firm Carlyle made an approach to buy Signature, which handles more than 1.6m private jet flights a year. Cascade is already the biggest investor in Signature with a 19% stake. According to a study by academics at Lund University, Gates is one of the world’s biggest “super-emitters” due to his regular private jet travel. He took 59 flights in one year travelling more than 200,000 miles, according to the report, which estimated that Gates’ private jet travel emitted about 1,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide. That compares with a global average of less than five tonnes per person. Researchers have found that private jets emit up to 40 times as much carbon dioxide per passenger than commercial jets. Gates, who says in the foreword to his forthcoming book that he has spent a decade investigating the causes and effects of climate change, did not respond to requests for comment about his views on the carbon footprint of private jets. The billionaire has previously said that owning private planes was his “guilty pleasure”. In a Reddit Ask Me Anything in 2014, Gates said: “Owning a plane is a guilty pleasure. Warren Buffett called his the Indefensible. I do get to a lot of places for Foundation work I wouldn’t be able to go to without it.” • This article was amended on 11 January 2021 to clarify that Signature Aviation provides ground services for private jets, rather than being an owner or operator of private jets itself."
2021-01-08T00:01:22Z,technology,Technology,"UK will miss 2025 target for full-fibre broadband rollout, MPs warn","Boris Johnson’s promise to deliver nationwide “turbocharged” broadband by 2025 will be missed because of a catalogue of government failures, parliament’s spending watchdog has concluded. In a timely report released on Friday as many children struggle to gain access to remote learning during lockdown, the public accounts committee has criticised the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) for failing to make any “meaningful progress” in delivering policies or legal changes to achieve a rapid rollout of gigabit broadband. As a result, thousands of homes and businesses, particularly in rural areas, could be left with slow broadband for many years, MPs warned. The report has been released amid growing concerns that a “digital divide” is leaving many pupils adrift during the coronavirus pandemic. Ofcom estimates that more than 880,000 children live in a household with only a mobile internet connection. Johnson first proposed a 2025 target for full-fibre broadband in June 2019 as he stood to become leader of the Conservative party. In a column for the Daily Telegraph, he wrote that a standing promise by Theresa May to introduce superfast broadband by 2033 was “ laughably unambitious”.
“If we want to unite our country and our society, we should commit now to delivering full fibre to every home in the land not in the mid-2030s – but in five years at the outside,” he wrote. In the 2019 general election, the Conservatives pledged to roll out gigabit broadband connectivity across the entire country by 2025. But in November 2020, the government rowed back on the target and said it was aiming for 85% instead. Friday’s report says that Johnson’s original target was unachievable and doubts that the 85% figure can be met within five years – a delay that could leave businesses and homes with slow broadband. “We are increasingly concerned that those in rural areas may have to pay more and may reach gigabit broadband speeds late. “Given the impact of Covid-19, the department must do more to protect those with limited access to the internet. “We remain unconvinced that if and when rural users finally do get gigabit broadband they will enjoy the same choice of service provider and the same protections as their urban counterparts,” the report said. The committee criticised the government for not allocating three-quarters of the £5bn total to roll out gigabit broadband until after 2024-25. “[The DCMS] is still developing its £5bn programme to subsidise rollout to the hardest to reach 20% of the UK’s 31m premises and could not tell us when it intends to deliver major milestones, such as the letting of contracts,” the report concluded. Senior civil servants in DCMS were also accused of being vagueabout the potential costs and delays from removing telecommunications equipment supplied by Huawei, which must be stripped from the UK’s 5G network by 2027 due to security risks. The Labour MP Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, said that the country’s third lockdown has highlighted the government’s failure to get to grips with its pledged broadband rollout. “Due to a litany of planning and implementation failures at DCMS, those promises are slipping further and further out of reach – even worse news for the ‘rural excluded’ who face years trying to recover with substandard internet connectivity. “Government cannot allow digital inequality to continue to compound and exacerbate the economic inequality that has been so harshly exposed in the Covid-19 pandemic,” she said. A DCMS spokesperson said the department disagreed with the report and claimed it contained some inaccuracies. “Gigabit capable broadband is being rolled out rapidly – from one in 10 households in 2019 to one in three households today. We expect that half of all households will have access to gigabit speeds by the end of this year, and the UK is deploying at a faster build rate than comparable countries. “This is evidence of the progress we have made to support the private sector and reduce barriers to roll out. We will take further rapid steps this year alongside the investment being made as part of our record £5bn UK Gigabit Programme, which will focus on ensuring the hardest to reach 20% of the country is not left behind,” the spokesperson said."
2021-01-07T19:38:14Z,technology,Technology,"Bitcoin tops $40,000 as investors seek hedge against inflation","Bitcoin has surged above the $40,000 (£29,500) mark for the first time in its history after doubling its value in less than a month. The record comes just days after the cryptocurrency hit an all-time high of more than $34,800 on Sunday, which was also the 12th anniversary of the bitcoin network being created. Bitcoin first breached the $20,000 mark in mid-December. The asset has become increasingly popular with mainstream institutional investor, and supporters argue that it is starting to supplant gold as a store of value.
Analysts at the US investment bank JP Morgan said this week that bitcoin could eventually hit $146,000 if it bolsters its reputation as an alternative to the precious metal. They said the cryptocurrency was also becoming an option for investors who were looking to hedge against inflation, but were turned off by the depreciating US dollar. There are more than 18m bitcoins in existence, created by the “miners” who provide the computational power underpinning the blockchain. The blockchain is a decentralised record of all transactions made using bitcoin that is maintained by a network of thousands of computers around the world. The system has a hardwired maximum of 21m coins. Some sceptics have warned that the cryptoboom could be heading for trouble, and that the coin itself has no intrinsic value. But Naeem Aslam, the chief market analyst at AvaTrade, an online broker, said the cryptocurrency continued to defy its critics. “A major price level has been hit and bitcoin has proved that this is not the asset class you want to mess around with. It has proved itself to all disbelievers today. “Institutional traders are the ones who have really got the rally going”, he said, adding that the next major moment for the cryptocurrency would come when it breached the $50,000 mark."
2021-01-07T19:31:14Z,technology,Technology,Elon Musk: from bullied schoolboy to world's richest man,"Elon Musk’s journey from South African schoolboy to the world’s richest man, pushing the boundaries of space travel, has been one of the more extraordinary tales in the modern business world. Here’s how he got there. Musk was born in 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa, to parents who divorced before he was 10. His mother was a model, his father an electromechanical engineer and property developer. Musk had an early interest in computing and taught himself computer programming. He was badly bullied at school and was even admitted to hospital for two weeks after a gang of boys threw him down some stairs. He became obsessed by moving to the US, which he saw as a land of opportunity. He collected degrees from a host of universities, including the University of Pennsylvania, while holding down internships in Silicon Valley. Eventually he was accepted for the PhD programme at California’s prestigious Stanford University. He dropped out after two days in favour of the booming world of internet startups. The first of his business ventures began in Palo Alto, California, famed for hosting tech companies such as Apple. His first venture, a software firm called Zip2 founded with his brother Kimbal, took time to succeed. They started it in 1995 and Musk has spoken of sleeping in the office because he couldn’t afford an apartment. He received $22m for his stake when the company was sold to the computing firm Compaq in 1999. It was PayPal that really launched Musk’s career into the stratosphere. He had founded a digital financial services business called X.com in 1999, which merged with the company that owned the fledgling payments processing business. Despite disagreements over his role and strategic vision, the company became a world leader and eBay paid $1.5bn in stock for it in 2002, a deal that was worth $165m to Musk. A fascination with space led Musk to invest about $100m of his rapidly expanding wealth in exploring the cosmos. He founded SpaceX in 2002 and has ambitions to build a colony on Mars within a few decades. In the meantime, he has focused on developing cheap and reusable spacecraft, enjoying considerable success. In 2020, SpaceX became the first private company to put a person into orbit. He has also explored subterranean travel, investing in the same “Hyperloop” concept that Sir Richard Branson is developing.
The undoubted business success story of his life, blowing PayPal out of the water, is Tesla. Musk wasn’t there in 2003, when the company was formed. But his funding and strategic vision has helped propel Tesla from a niche specialist in electric vehicles to a stock market giant valued at more than $600bn. Much of that growth has been recent. It soared to the current valuation within a few months of becoming the world’s most valuable carmaker at $205bn. By contrast, Ford, which pioneered the modern motorcar, is worth just over $35bn. Tesla only overtook Ford in terms of stock market value in 2017. However, Tesla has never made a profit over a full financial year. It entered the S&P 500 late last year as one of Wall Street’s most valuable companies. Musk’s share in Tesla – he owns about 20% – is what has propelled him to the top of the ranking of the world’s richest people. And he has yet to hit all the targets he needs to trigger a controversial incentive deal that could give him a controversial $55bn payday. Alongside his business prowess, Musk has been a colourful character, never far from boardroom clashes or high-profile controversy. He smoked cannabis on film during a 2018 podcast, an unusual move that hit Tesla’s share price, which was already fragile after he floated the idea of taking the company private out of the blue. He also attracted opprobrium over his reaction to a perceived snub from one of the cave divers who rescued a group of Thai schoolchildren from an underground cavern. When his offer was deemed surplus to requirements, Musk called the diver “paedo guy”. He won a defamation lawsuit over the slur."
2021-01-06T20:58:50Z,technology,Technology,DoJ confirms email accounts breached by SolarWinds hackers,"The US Department of Justice confirmed on Wednesday that its email systems had been accessed by the hackers who broke into the software company SolarWinds, another indication of the gravity of the breach that has shaken Washington.
The scale of the hack at the justice department was not immediately clear but it could be significant. The department, which has more than 100,000 employees across a series of law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and the US Marshals Service, said in a statement that 3% of its Office 365 mailboxes were potentially accessed. The statement went on to say that the justice department had no indication that any classified systems were affected. But winning access to as many as thousands of email inboxes from the nation’s premier law enforcement organization could still provide an intelligence bonanza for foreign hackers. The department plays a key role in rooting out foreign spies, enforcing sanctions and fighting corruption. The department has recently taken increasingly aggressive actions against foreign hackers, unsealing a series of indictments against Russian, Chinese and Iranian cyber spies in the run-up to the US presidential election two months ago. A justice spokesman, Marc Raimondi, declined to put a precise figure to the number of mailboxes targeted. The statement said the justice department’s office of the chief information officer discovered the breach on the day before Christmas, weeks after the first reports emerged that hackers suspected of acting on Russia’s behalf had broken into US government networks. Russia has denied responsibility for the hacking campaign, which has been described as one of the most sophisticated operations uncovered in years. But on Tuesday, the office of the US director of national intelligence said Russia was probably behind the hack in the first formal statement of attribution from the Trump administration. The hackers were able to gain access to a swath of government agencies by tampering with network monitoring software sold by the Austin-based SolarWinds. In a joint statement, the national intelligence office, the FBI, the National Security Agency, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency inside the Department of Homeland Security said the actor, “likely Russian in origin, is responsible for most or all of the recently discovered, ongoing cyber compromises of both government and non-governmental networks”. The investigation is continuing, they said, and could turn up additional government victims. As of now the hackers’ goal appeared to be collecting intelligence, rather than any destructive acts. Fewer than 10 government agencies were affected, the director of national intelligence said, but did not specify how many. Cybersecurity experts have said a full recovery from the breaches could take months – or even longer."
2021-01-06T01:15:01Z,technology,Technology,Facebook restarts political ad ban in Georgia following runoff votes,"Facebook has announced it will again ban political advertising targeting users in the state of Georgia, following the election there on Tuesday. The social media company said that, starting on Wednesday, Georgia users would again be subject to the US-wide political ad ban instated following the 3 November presidential vote. Facebook had temporarily lifted the ban in Georgia ahead of the runoff elections to allow political messaging to reach more voters. “Following the Georgia runoff elections, Georgia will re-join the existing nationwide pause on social issue, elections and political ads,” Facebook said in a blogpost. “This is part of our ongoing efforts to reduce the potential for confusion or abuse,” the company told advertisers in an email reviewed by Reuters. Facebook and Google had introduced pauses on political ads after the November presidential election as part of measures to combat misinformation and other abuses on the platforms. Google lifted its pause in December, saying it no longer considered the post-election period to be a “sensitive event”. Facebook lifted its own ad ban on 15 December exclusively for the state of Georgia, due to “feedback from experts and advertisers across the political spectrum about the importance of expressing voice” and using Facebook to reach voters ahead of Georgia’s runoff elections. For the rest of the country, the ban remained. The change announced on Tuesday means any ads about the Georgia runoff elections would be paused and any advertisers who were previously allowed to run ads about the Georgia runoff elections would not be able to create new political ads.
It comes after it was discovered that Republican politicians and other operatives were using advertising on Facebook to target Georgia voters with misinformation in the final days ahead of the vote. A report from the global human rights group Avaaz found a number of ads on Facebook sponsored by Republicans that featured misinformation or falsehoods meant to sway voter opinion. One sponsored by the Senate Leadership Fund claims the Democratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff is “threatening to defund the police”, which he is not. Another from the Republican party run in December accused the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, of scheming to replace the president-elect, Joe Biden, with the vice-president-elect, Kamala Harris. Nearly half of these false ads were shared by political candidates in the race, who are exempt from Facebook’s fact checking rules. Facebook has come under fire for the broad exemptions it grants politicians who advertise on its platform. Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has defended the policy, saying Facebook should not be the arbiter of truth in political scenarios. Critics of Facebook say the spread of lies ahead of the Georgia election underscore how ineffective the company’s measures to address these issues have been. The company’s oversight board, introduced in late 2020, was meant to adjudicate disputes regarding content. But the group is not able to take down content quickly, limiting its effectiveness in breaking news situations. A group of academics and civil rights leaders critical of Facebook, calling themselves the Real Facebook Oversight Board, say the misinformation exposed in Georgia this week is proof there is more to be done. “The Facebook Oversight Board is complicit in a misinformation campaign in Georgia,” the group said in a statement. “They must do better, and Facebook needs to be held accountable for their failure to protect voters from disinformation.” Reuters contributed to this report"
2021-01-05T16:36:57Z,technology,Technology,YouTube reverses TalkRadio ban for allegedly breaching content policy,"YouTube has reversed a short-lived ban of the digital station TalkRadio from its platform, about 12 hours after it removed the organisation’s channel for what it said were breaches of its community guidelines. The station, part of Rupert Murdoch’s TalkSport network, said it had not been told by the platform what the most recent breach was. A TalkRadio spokesperson said: “We urgently await a detailed response from Google/YouTube about the nature of the breach that has led to our channel being removed from its platform. “TalkRadio is an Ofcom-licensed and regulated broadcaster and has robust editorial controls in place, taking care to balance debate. “We regularly interrogate government data and we have controls in place, use verifiable sources and give space to a careful selection of voices and opinions.” On Tuesday evening, the streaming platform broke its silence and reinstated TalkRadio’s account. “TalkRadio’s YouTube channel was briefly suspended, but upon further review, has now been reinstated,” a YouTube spokesperson said. “We quickly remove flagged content that violate our Community Guidelines, including Covid-19 content that explicitly contradict expert consensus from local health authorities or the World Health Organization. We make exceptions for material posted with an educational, documentary, scientific or artistic purpose, as was deemed in this case.” A TalkRadio insider told the Guardian that the problem was particularly acute for shows that host public debates about the coronavirus. “You can have a debate about an issue and if, in someone’s opinion, it undermines official guidance in any way, then it is classed as medical misinformation,” they said. YouTube’s content moderation system enforces a “three strikes” rule, under which accounts can be issued “strikes” for posting content that violates content guidelines. A single strike carries with it a number of restrictions, but a channel receiving three strikes in a 90-day period will be removed from the platform entirely. One previous strike had been issued on TalkRadio’s account for a discussion featuring the Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, the Guardian understands. The platform has a specific set of policies around medical misinformation related to Covid. At least two of the station’s hosts, Mark Dolan and Julia Hartley-Brewer, regularly speak out against lockdown policies both on and off-air. Shortly after news of the suspension broke, the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, appeared on Hartley-Brewer’s show, and spoke out in defence of TalkRadio’s right to criticise the government. “I don’t believe in censorship and we have a free and fair press, and we have commentators and interviewers of distinction who do criticise the government’s position,” Gove said, “From Lord Sumption to Peter Hitchens and others, and long may it remain so. I think it’s absolutely right that people should ask questions.” YouTube’s definition of medical misinformation, while similar to that of competitors such as Facebook and Twitter, has drawn criticism in its own right. Commentators have noted that the rule prevents criticism of organisations that have themselves changed their advice – in some cases significantly – over the course of the pandemic. In March 2020, for instance, many tech platforms classed as misinformation claims that mask-wearing could help prevent the spread of Covid; now, those same tech platforms class as misinformation the claim that mask-wearing does not help prevent the spread of Covid. In both cases, statements from local and international health authorities lay behind the decision. An Ofcom spokesperson said: “This was a decision for YouTube. Like other UK stations, TalkRadio’s radio channel comes under our broadcasting code. When we assess programmes under our rules, we take account of a broadcaster’s right to freedom of expression, and the right of listeners to receive information and ideas.”"
2021-01-05T06:00:50Z,technology,Technology,'He's a risk-taker': Germans divided over Elon Musk's new GigaFactory,"For the past 10 months, Silas Heineken has been flying a drone over one of Germany’s biggest building sites and posting the images on YouTube. The 14-year-old self-named “Tesla Kid” has built a significant following, as tens of thousands tune in each week to see the latest developments in Elon Musk’s GigaFactory as it emerges at speed from the sandy ground of Brandenburg, south-east of Berlin. “He is a huge visionary who has great ideas, which he has managed to realise,” Heineken said in an interview.
Having hung out on his bicycle to see Musk when he recently visited, the schoolboy sees an electric car factory close to his home in the sleepy town of Grünheide as a huge opportunity for the region. It is by far the biggest industrial settlement in the area in a century and Brandenburg’s economics minister, Jörg Steinbach, has called it a chance for the region “to become a leading energy revolution location in Germany and Europe”. Musk has promised to create 10,000 jobs and turn out about 500,000 cars a year, starting with its Model Y, and construct the world’s largest battery plant at the site. His vision will put the region on the map. Politicians talk off the record of their debt towards Musk, who they say could have easily gone to Asia instead, where labour costs are lower and environmental controls and construction standards less stringent. But while landowners are among those rubbing their hands with glee, having seen land prices increase tenfold since Musk made public his intentions in November 2019, there are many opponents. Most of them say they like the bosky backwater of Grünheide precisely because it is not on the map, and are horrified when they see – particularly on Heineken’s videos, depicting the emergence of the foundry, the pressing plant, the paint shop and the assembly plant – the speed at which the project is coming along, and the extent of the woodland it has already swallowed up.
“Grünheide is just a small place of 9,000 souls, bordering a conservation area. Musk’s plans will turn it into a town of 40,000 – it will become like Wolfsburg,” says Werner Klink, referring to the city west of Berlin purpose-built in the 1930s around the production of the VW motorcar. Klink is a member of the Grünheide’s citizens’ initiative, a group of locals who are campaigning to stop the project. Construction projects in Germany, he says, usually take time “due to all the permits you need and regulations you must abide by before you even put a shovel in the ground”. Musk has instead chosen the very un-German route of starting the work first and then securing the permits. “Even if they told him he would not be allowed to continue, he will have already caused so much damage there’s no way he can take the site back to its original state,” Klink argues. “Immense, irreversible harm has been done to the nature, potentially to the groundwater, to the forest, the flora, fauna.” One hundred hectares of pine trees have already been felled, and a further 86 hectares are likely to follow, after a court ruling last month. The barriers to Tesla come in the form of the sand lizard and European smooth snake, species that live in the woodland, Germany’s Nature Protection Union (NABU) has pointed out, and are at the heart of the legal battle to stop the project. There is also the matter of an outstanding downpayment to the local environment agency of €100m to cover possible remediation costs, which a court also ruled on 18 December was reason to halt the project. Lawyers for Tesla have filed to extend the deadline for payment, the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel has reported.
Despite 360 objections to the project having been lodged, authorities have effectively allowed it to go ahead by telling Musk he does so at his own risk. The practice is not so unusual in Germany, though on this scale it is unprecedented. “Musk is a risk-taker, that’s what he does, and he’s banked on the fact they’ll never tell him to demolish his building, particularly when so many jobs are at stake,” says Klink, a retired geophysicist. He says the speed with which the site has sprung up has left no time to properly inspect the site. “There’s a considerable danger that the digging will contaminate the groundwater. Just one metre below the surface there is salt water and there are signs it’s rising. If it mixes with the fresh water we’ll have a huge problem on our hands.” A protest in December in front of Axel Springer House in Berlin over the German publisher’s tribute to Musk’s “ambition to make the world a better place” with its eponymous award drew climate activists and environmentalists, including NABU, the Society for Species Protection and the Grüne Liga (green league). Norbert Heß, the Brandenburg spokesman of the Ecological Democrats (ÖDP), a small political party, has accused the larger Green party of “violating their oath of office” by helping to accelerate the project. Heß says many aspects of the project have been poorly thought through. Why was consideration not given to the brown coal mining area of Lausitz in the south of Brandenburg, looking for a new raison d’etre after Germany’s planned brown coal phase-out, he asks. “The land where the opencast mines are is already stripped of nature,” Heß says. The Greens, in government in Brandenburg, say they welcome the project because it offers a viable alternative to the diesel motor, as well as creating much-needed local jobs.
Tesla shies away from talking to the media. It has tried to express that it is well-intentioned in the form of projects such as pledging to plant three times as many trees as it fells, and building fences to protect the lizards and snakes. It also set up an information kiosk in the town, but that has been sparsely staffed. The coronavirus has reduced communication further. Most statements come in the form of succinct tweets from Musk himself, such as one in the run-up to Christmas, which simply said: “Thank you Brandenburg and Grünheide” after the mayor doubled his commitment to the project by signing off plans to create a transport system around the plant, which is also to include a park-and-ride facility to transfer workers to and from the factory. Klink said he has not yet met Musk, who occasionally turns up to see the progress of his project. “I don’t have any need or desire to meet him,” he said.

2021-01-03T17:18:56Z,technology,Technology,Bitcoin hits record high on 12th anniversary of its creation,"Bitcoin has surged to a record high amid rising interest from investors and claims that the volatile cryptocurrency is on the way to becoming a mainstream payment method. Having quadrupled in value during 2020, bitcoin began 2021 strongly by breaking through the $30,000 (£22,000) mark for the first time, less than three weeks after first trading above $20,000. On Sunday, it hit a new high of more than $34,800, on the 12th anniversary of the bitcoin network being created.
Bitcoin’s rapid climb has rekindled memories of previous parabolic rallies and crashes. During 2017, it leapt from about $1,000 to peak over $19,000, before tumbling to below $4,000 by the end of 2018. But this latest rally comes as some financial institutions show growing interest in bitcoin as an asset class, and as its supporters argue that it is supplanting gold as a store of value. “The number keeps going up as the market has seemingly never been more bullish,” said Paolo Ardoino, the CTO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. “We see a very bright future ahead for all bitcoin holders.”
With the US dollar at its lowest level since spring 2018, advocates of cryptocurrencies claim they protect against inflationary money-printing by central banks, which launched unprecedented stimulus programmes last year amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “Some will argue that there is more to come from both gold and bitcoin, especially if governments keep piling up debts and central banks do their best to fund that borrowing through the backdoor with quantitative easing, zero interest rates and bond yield manipulation, thanks to the scarcity value relative to cash,” said Russ Mould, the investment director of UK investment platform AJ Bell. “Others will argue neither gold nor bitcoin have intrinsic value, as they do not generate cash,” he added.
Bitcoin received a boost from PayPal last autumn, when the bank announced it would allow customers to buy, sell and use the cryptocurrency. Analysts said this could be driving the price surge, by creating a shortage as PayPal buys up newly created bitcoins. There are more than 18m bitcoins in existence, created by the miners who provide the computational power underpinning the blockchain, which records transactions made using bitcoin. The system has a hardwired maximum of 21m coins.
Sunday’s latest record high came 12 years to the day after Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, created the first entry in the bitcoin blockchain. This “genesis block” included a headline from the 3 January 2009 edition of the Times, reading: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”. City firms have shown more interest in bitcoin recently. In December, the UK investment management firm Ruffer said it held £550m in bitcoin, as a hedge to the risks in a “fragile monetary system and distorted financial market”.
The hedge fund managers Stanley Druckenmiller and Paul Tudor Jones have also backed bitcoin as a financial asset. Druckenmiller argued that it could have “a lot of attraction as a store of value to both millennials and the new west coast money”. Sceptics warn that the crypto boom could be heading for trouble. The economics professor Nouriel Roubini, a long-time critic of bitcoin, insists it has no intrinsic value. “The price of bitcoin is totally manipulated by a bunch of people, by a bunch of whales. It doesn’t have any fundamental value,” he told Yahoo Finance just before Christmas. “We’re close to the point where the hyperbolic bubble is going to go bust.”"
2021-01-03T13:55:45Z,technology,Technology,"Tesla almost hits 500,000-car delivery target for 2020 despite pandemic","Tesla reported record deliveries of its electric cars in the last three months of 2020, coming within a whisker of achieving the half-million target for the year set by its chief executive, Elon Musk. The California-based manufacturer’s annual sales rose by 36% after a final quarter that exceeded analysts’ expectations, delivering a total of 499,550 cars in 2020. Tesla delivered 180,570 electric vehicles between October and December, falling just short of the overall target Musk had set at the beginning of the year, before the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Covid-19 forced the shutdown of the company’s Fremont US assembly plant in the spring, but Musk urged employees to increase production to hit the target, and last week offered incentives including free “self-driving” options worth $10,000 (£7,300) on Tesla cars whose paperwork and delivery was completed in the last days of December. Despite apparently missing the target, Tesla said it had “produced and delivered half a million vehicles, in line with our most recent guidance”, and Musk hailed it as a “major milestone”. He tweeted: “So proud of the Tesla team for achieving this major milestone! At the start of Tesla thought we had (optimistically) a 10% chance of surviving at all.”
More than 509,000 cars were made by the manufacturer in 2020. Production of its Model Y SUV has also begun in its Chinese plant in Shanghai, with deliveries expected to begin shortly, Tesla said.
Tesla’s share price, which rose eightfold in 2020, ended the year at more than $705, valuing the company at $669bn – 20% of which is owned by Musk himself, who is the world’s second-richest man. It overtook Toyota earlier in the year as the world’s most valuable carmaker and last month joined the prestigious Wall Street S&P index, immediately becoming its sixth most valuable listed company."
2021-01-03T13:24:47Z,technology,Technology,'Peak hype': why the driverless car revolution has stalled,"By 2021, according to various Silicon Valley luminaries, bandwagoning politicians and leading cab firms in recent years, self-driving cars would have long been crossing the US, started filing along Britain’s motorways and be all set to provide robotaxis in London. 1 January has not, however, brought a driverless revolution. Indeed in the last weeks of 2020 Uber, one of the biggest players and supposed beneficiaries, decided to park its plans for self-driving taxis, selling off its autonomous division to Aurora in a deal worth about $4bn (£3bn) – roughly half what it was valued at in 2019. The decision did not, Uber’s chief executive protested, mean the company no longer believed in self-driving vehicles. “Few technologies hold as much promise to improve people’s lives with safe, accessible, and environmentally friendly transportation,” Dara Khosrowshahi said. But more people might now take that promise with a pinch of salt.
Prof Nick Reed, a transport consultant who ran UK self-driving trials, says: “The perspectives have changed since 2015, when it was probably peak hype. Reality is setting in about the challenges and complexity.” Automated driving, says Reed, could still happen in the next five years on highways with clearly marked lanes, limited to motorised vehicles all going in the same direction. Widespread use in cities remains some way further out, he says: “But the benefits are still there.” The most touted benefit is safety, with human error blamed for more than 90% of road accidents. Proponents also say autonomous cars would be more efficient and reduce congestion. Looking back, Reed says “the technology worked … people had the sense, it does the right thing most of the time, we are 90% of the way there. But it is that last bit which is the toughest. Being able reliably to do the right thing every single time, whether it’s raining, snowing, fog, is a bigger challenge than anticipated.” Waymo, the Google spin-off that has led the field, could be a case in point: having quickly wowed the world with footage of self-driving cars, the subsequent steps have appeared small. In October last year it announced the public could now hail fully driverless taxis, “in the near term” without a safety driver in any car – although the range remains limited to the sunny suburbs of Phoenix, Arizona, whose every centimetre has been mapped by Waymo computers.
Elsewhere, robotaxis have stalled. Like Uber, the cab firm Addison Lee had staked out bold ambitions, signing up with the UK autonomy pioneer Oxbotica in 2018 to get robotaxis into London by 2021. That deal was quietly dropped in March last year, under new ownership. Addison Lee’s chief executive, Liam Griffin, said: “Driverless cars are best left to the OEMs [manufacturers], and don’t form part of our current plans.” The launch of an autonomous taxi service by Ford has also been postponed at least a year to 2022 because of the pandemic. “Globally, Covid-19 has delayed trials and launches of connected and automated vehicles,” says Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Regulatory changes could still allow developments such as Automated Lane Keeping Systems being rolled out in 2021 across everyday cars. “ALKS is the first version of automated driving technology which could prevent some 47,000 serious accidents over the next decade, while creating up to 420,000 new jobs,” Hawes said. The system could let the car take control on UK motorways this year – although insurers are trying to talk the government out of giving the go-ahead. Alexandra Smyth, who leads on autonomous systems at the Royal Academy of Engineering, said: “There’s lots of progress and interesting developments with regulations and codes of practice – all important components that sit alongside the technology itself. But realistically there are still going to be errors and things that don’t perform as we hoped. Public trust will be one of the major hurdles.” Fears were stoked after Uber’s self-driving car killed a pedestrian in Arizona in 2018. And despite Elon Musk’s continuing bold claims for Tesla, and reports that Apple is still secretly pushing to develop a personal autonomous vehicle by 2024, the law is unlikely to permit drivers to relinquish the wheel soon. According to Christian Wolmar, the author of Driverless Cars: On a Road to Nowhere?, problems such as social acceptance, cybersecurity and cost have never been addressed. He says: “People do not want to replace the car outside the front door with an app it’s just not a viable concept. I think more and more people are sceptical of the model that we’ll all be in robocars soon. Instead, the industry is now talking about specific uses.” If Oxbotica’s Paul Newman, one of the Oxford University professors pioneering Britain’s autonomous industry, has any doubts over the long term, he is not showing it – although he says the level of autonomy where “occasionally there might be a remote assist” is a far more achievable ambition than a world where the machines can entirely get on with it. Oxbotica is running a fleet of autonomous Ford Mondeos on public roads in a trial in Oxford – but the technological progress, he says, is not about robotaxis: “It’s purely about the software, it’s agnostic about the vehicles.”
The driverless car world, he says, is “a great moonshot”: cars are a huge market but also the hardest to transform, long after autonomous mining or rail or shuttle services are in place. Newman compares the progress with mobiles phones, recalling the first he saw, wielded by Danny Glover in the 1987 film Lethal Weapon, which was the size of a small suitcase. “Is a future of driverless cars coming? Assuredly as mobile phones. This is the normal cycle that technology goes through. We’re still moving along that graph,” he said. “We’ve gone through the flashy stage, when we’ve said it’s six months away … Now we’ve got engineers saying this is properly hard.”"
2020-12-30T11:01:16Z,technology,Technology,"Bitcoin surges to record $28,500, quadrupling in value this year","Bitcoin has continued its end-of-year Santa Claus rally, surging to a new high of more than $28,500. The cryptocurrency gained more than 5% to hit $28,572 on Wednesday. It is up 47% since the start of December and is on track for its biggest monthly gain since May 2019. Bitcoin has almost quadrupled in value this year as interest from institutional investors has grown. As the US dollar has declined, bitcoin has become a more attractive investment amid concerns that huge government stimulus packages prompted by the coronavirus pandemic will fuel inflation. In the US, a bigger package could be passed once Joe Biden has replaced Donald Trump as president. On Wednesday the dollar dropped to its lowest level since April 2018, when measured against a basket of currencies. The US currency is under pressure as investors move into riskier assets, betting on a strong economic recovery next year as coronavirus vaccines are rolled out. The vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca was approved in the UK on Wednesday. Bitcoin has also been boosted by expectations that it will become a more mainstream payment method. PayPal has launched a crypto trading service on its platform and has reportedly bought nearly 70% of all new bitcoin in circulation. A number of hedge fund managers have revealed this year that they have invested in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is even being touted as an alternative to gold. Gold, the traditional safe-haven investment, has declined since hitting a record high of more than $2,000 an ounce in August, and is now flat at $1,879 an ounce. Some analysts expect gold and bitcoin to battle it out for dominance next year. Paolo Ardoino, the chief technology officer of the crypto exchange Bitfinex, said bitcoin could draw more interest from a broader audience, not just fund managers. “While a growing institutional presence has been part of the narrative of the current bull run, we may see increased retail interest in bitcoin as a form of digital gold,” he said.
Other cryptocurrencies such as Ether have also rallied. However, concerns remain about the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies, and there are regulatory issues. Last week the US Securities and Exchange Commission accused Ripple Labs and its senior executives of misleading investors in XRP, the third largest cryptocurrency, by selling $1bn of the virtual tokens without registering with the agency."
2020-12-30T04:08:48Z,technology,Technology,Uber Eats avoids landmark ruling on workers' status by settling case with delivery rider,"Uber has settled a high-profile case with one of its food delivery riders, avoiding a landmark ruling on whether gig economy workers are employees or contractors, experts say. The Australian arm of the multinational company settled with former Uber Eats delivery rider Amita Gupta before the full bench of the federal court could rule on whether she was an employee or a contractor. It would have been the first ruling in the federal court on the status of Uber’s workers.
The Transport Workers’ Union said it believed Uber had settled because the company was facing defeat after a series of critical questions from judges in a court hearing earlier in November. Federal court judge Mordecai Bromberg said in court that Uber Eats riders “appear to be the representative of the Uber Eats”, despite the company’s protests. “Who would the public have perceived the worker as an emanation of, if not Uber?” he asked. “It could be anybody,” the company’s barrister, Ian Neil, replied. “There’s nothing that represents her to be an emanation of Uber, apart from the fact that she would turn up with food in her hand at the end of a process that had begun with the customer ordering the food.” Bromberg asked: “Why would you assume, given the process … starts with Uber and ends with an Uber app, so far as the customer is concerned – why would you assume that the driver is an emanation of the restaurant [rather than Uber]?” He continued: “Everybody knows what function Uber plays. The restaurant’s function is to prepare the food. Uber’s function is to deliver the food; isn’t that right? “The very name Uber would convey to the ordinary person some form of transportation service; wouldn’t it?” Neil replied: “We could not accept that.” Labour law expert Prof Joellen Riley Munton from the University of Technology Sydney, said it appeared that Uber had “decided not to take the risk” of a court ruling, and settled. Earlier rulings in the Fair Work Commission had sided with the tech giant, and ruled their workers were not employees. This case would have been the first ruling in the federal court. “Uber has clearly taken the view that a federal court decision (of a full bench) finding that Ms Gupta was in fact an employee would be very disruptive of its business model,” Riley Munton said. “The settlement means that there is still no federal court ruling on the question of whether workers like Ms Gupta are employees, so there is no precedent to disturb the Fair Work Commission findings in the Gupta case, or in earlier cases.” The Transport Workers’ Union national secretary, Michael Kaine, said he was confident Uber would have lost. “It is clear from the court hearing that Uber was on the ropes,” he said. “A settlement … was the only option left to the company in the face of a potential judgment.” However, Riley Munton said the critical comments in the hearing did not necessarily indicate how a court would have ruled. She said the recent case of CFMMEU v Personnel Contracting Pty Lty, where a backpacker challenged whether he was an independent contractor, showed the limits of relying on comments. “Justices Lee and Allsop were both very critical of the arrangement and said that it beggared belief that a person doing such menial work was an ‘independent contractor’, but they still decided that he was one, because they felt constrained by an earlier decision dealing with the same labour hire outfit’s contracts,” she said. “So critical comments don’t always lead to a decision. Still, the law is still unresolved in a case like Gupta’s. They wouldn’t necessarily have any precedent that they had to follow in that case. An application of the high court authority in Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd may well have found that she was an employee.”
Riley Munton said the union was correct in saying the case, if it had not been settled, could have reshaped the entire gig economy. “As is always the case with legal decisions, they are decided on their own facts and can be precedent only where the same or very similar facts prevail,” she said. “Because Uber Eats uses the same contract for all its staff, it would very likely mean that all its drivers on that contract were employees and that would have significant ramifications for their business. “It would also pave the way for the other platforms to be challenged, if the terms of their contracts and their working arrangements are the same.” A spokesman for Uber said they “welcome the resolution of this case”. “Uber Eats has previously won this case in two hearings before the Fair Work Commission, a specialist employment tribunal, including before the full bench which comprised the three most senior members of the Fair Work Commission, including the president.” Kaine said athough the union supported Gupta’s outcome, the key to reforming the gig economy was regulation from the government, not legal cases.
“It should not take brave workers like Amita standing up to a global multinational corporations to hold them to account,” he said. “Workers across Australia should have rights and the federal government must take responsibility for workers … We urge the government to carefully read the transcript of the hearing and to start looking at Uber with the same jaundiced view that the federal court judges in this case did.” Riley Munton said the case could lead to more Uber workers taking the matter to court and winning a settlement. “I think one of the most interesting outcomes of this case is that other Uber workers with a grievance might feel empowered to push harder for a settlement themselves,” she said. “In seeking to avoid litigation that is getting uncomfortable, Uber might need to treat the claims of workers more seriously in future – to avoid matters proceeding to court. “There could be a de facto improvement in workers’ treatment – at least when it comes to challenging being sacked from the platform.” Gupta had taken the company to court over an unfair dismissal claim, after she was cut off from the delivery app for late deliveries. Two previous rulings in the Fair Work Commission sided with Uber, and she then appealed to the federal court before the settlement."
2020-12-29T07:00:36Z,technology,Technology,How we are changing the way we rate sustainability of consumer electronics,"When we first started looking at the sustainability of consumer electronics at the beginning of 2019, we soon discovered that reliable information was very hard to find. It was difficult to establish which smartphones, tablets, headphones and other items were even capable of being repaired, let alone how long they might last or whether they contained recycled materials. The status quo was very much “don’t ask, don’t tell”. Upon asking, very few manufacturers even had records of the relevant information. Fewer still made it available for public consumption. So at the start of 2020, to try to create change for the better, we began including sustainability information alongside product performance for all our standalone consumer technology reviews. We looked at repairability, the battery lifespan and ease of replacement, the software lifecycle, its material construction and the availability of trade-in and recycling schemes. The aim was to give readers a fuller picture of the product so they could weigh what was most important to them and make an informed decision. Products from manufacturers that were making good progress on any of the sustainability fronts were awarded bonus marks as a way of highlighting them above competitors, with the Fairphone 3+ a prime example: a reasonable smartphone made exceptional by its ease of repair, inclusion of recycled materials and ethical manufacturing. Blood out of a stone
At the start, retrieving information from of the various product manufacturers was like getting blood out of a stone. Even after weeks of arguing and delays, it could often turn out that they were indeed making progress, seeking to include recycled materials, make the products more repairable and sustainable. They just didn’t want to tell anyone. For many manufacturers, doing good things in the background that are financially viable is far less risky than going on the record when things in the supply chain can change and put them in difficult positions. Technology firms would often rather stay silent than confirm or deny anything. It is still hard to find the required information to make an informed decision on how sustainable a product truly is, but after a year of pressure from the Guardian we are making progress. Apple has been publishing environmental impact assessments for its main products for a few years – it still disappointingly does not for accessories, which include AirPods and other high-volume items – but now others are joining suit. Google recently began publishing similar breakdowns, as did Microsoft. Manufacturers are making use of recycled materials too. Google’s pledge to include recycled material in all its products by 2030 has already resulted in recycled plastic and metal making it into its phones and speakers, while Amazon’s new Echo speakers include significant amounts. Many of the best high-volume items such as smartphones are more repairable than ever, even if it means using specialist tools that ultimately requires the manufacturer to carry out the fix rather than the owner or a third-party. Even in challenging categories such as true wireless earbuds, there is movement to make them less disposable. The batteries in Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live earbuds can be replaced and they contain post-consumer recycled plastic. Good cop becomes bad cop
But these are just baby steps and there is a long way to go. So starting from January 2021, our assessment criteria for sustainability will be flipped from positive to negative. If a product does not meet a certain threshold for progress on the sustainability front it will lose marks, meaning that rather than the good products being awarded more, the bad products will be marked down. Based on 2020’s performance, that will undoubtedly see a large range of products from both small and big companies being marked down. The Guardian operates a five-star rating scheme, so expect to see many more three and four-star products that, despite being excellent on most fronts, are not good on sustainability. Equally, those products that exist purely to be sustainable also have to be good for other reasons – it’s not enough any more to make a repairable, sustainable device if it doesn’t work very well in the first place. The sustainability of the products we buy and use has never been more important, not just for the planet but for our cash-strapped wallets. Products that are great now and will go the distance for years to come are better for everyone. I hope the Guardian’s consumer technology reviews are useful in guiding you to that end."
